<h3>Chapter 26 – Please Open It</h3>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Takasegawa-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as Yuzuru sighed,</p>



<p>Suddenly, a voice called out to him, and he trembled involuntarily.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;you don&#8217;t have to be that surprised&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, I&#8217;m sorry. &#8230;good morning, Nagiri-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>The one who approached Yuzuru was a tall, slender, beautiful girl.</p>



<p>It was Tenka Nagiri.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yes, here. I&#8217;m always indebted to you. It&#8217;s obligatory though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, thank you very much.&#8221;</p>







<p>It seemed that she had come to give him obligatory chocolate.</p>



<p>Yuzuru gratefully accepted the chocolate from Tenka.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Who is that from? It&#8217;s not from Arisa-san, is it?&#8221;</p>







<p>She said as she looked at the pretty wrapped box that was left on his desk.</p>



<p>According to Ayaka&#8217;s testimony, Ayaka and her friends made chocolates together &#8230;so they must know the boxes and packaging for the chocolates that each of them made.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why she was able to find out that it belonged to someone other than the four of them at a glance.</p>







<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know. It was inside my desk&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t say who sent it.&#8221;</p>







<p>It may be inside the packaging&#8230;</p>



<p>There was no letter or message of any kind, at least not on the outside.</p>







<p>&#8220;Chocolate from a stranger&#8230; What if it&#8217;s not store-bought?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;No comment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I guess so. I think that&#8217;s normal. Your safety comes first.&#8221;</p>







<p>Tenka, guessing from Yuzuru&#8217;s reply, patted Yuzuru on the shoulder as if to comfort him.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough being a popular guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as popular as you. I&#8217;m sure many boys would love to have your chocolate.&#8221;</p>







<p>It goes without saying that Tenka was also a very beautiful girl and is very popular among boys.</p>



<p>The level of her appearance was on par with Arisa, Ayaka, and Chiharu (of course, Yuzuru thinks Arisa is the absolute best).</p>



<p>Many boys would love to have chocolates from Tenka.</p>



<p>&#8230;In fact, the boys in the class seemed to be looking at her a little more sharply.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m not a good cook. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that good because it&#8217;s not as good as Ayaka&#8217;s, to be honest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The important thing is not the chocolate itself, but who gave it to you, and with what intention.&#8221;</p>







<p>In that sense, chocolates from an unknown sender were a little difficult to handle.</p>



<p>For now, Yuzuru decided to put away the chocolate from the unknown sender and the chocolate from Tenka in his bag.</p>



<p>Then he asked Tenka.</p>







<p>&#8220;Have you already given them to Hijiri?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? &#8230;W-why did Hijiri-kun&#8217;s name come up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing personal.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru said that, Tenka turned her head away from him.</p>







<p>“&#8230;C-classes are about to start.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah yeah. Good luck to you, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s not like I need that or anything.&#8221;</p>







<p>After saying that, Tenka walked away from the classroom as if she was running away.</p>



<p>Now, it was lunchtime.</p>



<p>After finishing his lunch with Soichiro and the others, Yuzuru came back to the classroom.</p>



<p>Almost at the same time, Yuzuru&#8217;s cell phone vibrated.</p>



<p>When he checked to see who it was from,&#8230;it was a text message from Arisa.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Did you enjoy your lunch?&#8221;]</p>







<p>Somehow, Yuzuru guessed the intention of Arisa&#8217;s email.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like she usually asks for feedback on her bento during lunchtime.</p>



<p>Normally, after lunch, Yuzuru would send a text message to Arisa when he had settled down.</p>



<p>The next morning, when he receives his new lunch box, he usually thank her directly and gives her his opinion.</p>



<p>Therefore, what Arisa wanted to ask was not what she thought of the lunch box.</p>



<p>The reason why she asked him about his impressions of the lunchbox was probably just a conversation starter for her.</p>







<p>[&#8220;It was delicious again today. The white fish was especially good.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that as I&#8217;ve never put that in a bento before&#8230; I grilled it with herbs. Did it smell fishy?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8216;No, it didn&#8217;t bother me.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Normally, the conversation would end with, &#8220;&#8211; was delicious&#8221; and &#8220;That&#8217;s good to hear&#8221;.</p>



<p>But today, the conversation was unusually long.</p>



<p>It was clear to him that she was blatantly trying to prolong the conversation.</p>







<p>Then, after a brief exchange&#8230;</p>







<p>[&#8220;Who was that chocolate from?&#8221;]</p>







<p>Finally, Arisa cut to the chase.</p>



<p>It was just a question, no special emoticons or stamps were used, but there was a certain aura of uncanny, of not being allowed to cover it up.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru looked up for a moment and then turned his gaze to Arisa&#8217;s seat.</p>



<p>Arisa was clutching her phone with both hands, staring at the screen with a blank expression.</p>







<p>&#8230;That&#8217;s just scary.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. There was no sender name on it.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Yuzuru replied, and the reply came back in the blink of an eye.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Are you telling the truth?&#8221;]</p>







<p>There was no reason for him to lie.　</p>



<p>For some reason, Yuzuru felt as if Arisa was accusing him of something.</p>



<p>Even though he hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong.</p>







<p>[&#8220;It&#8217;s true.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Have you opened it yet?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;No, not yet.&#8221;]</p>







<p>[&#8220;Please open it.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Even though it was only three words,</p>



<p>The text was powerful enough to convince him to open it.</p>



<p>When Yuzuru was feeling a little puzzled, another email arrived soon after.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Please open it.&#8221;]</p>







<p>It was the same text.</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but look at Arisa.　</p>



<p>Then&#8230; his eyes met hers.</p>







<p>Her face was expressionless.</p>







<p>Yuzuru hurriedly typed back a text.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I&#8217;ll be opening it in the washroom now.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Then Yuzuru stood up from his seat as if he was jumping and ran to the washroom carrying his bag.</p>
