<h3>Chapter 32 – Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves</h3>

	
<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8221;</p>






<p>As she strained her words, the gaze of her family pierced into Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa cowered involuntarily, terrified, but&#8230;</p>







<p>(<em>Yuzuru-san&#8230;!</em>)</p>







<p>She tightly squeezed her engagement ring.</p>



<p>She confirmed that Yuzuru&#8217;s love for her was tangible.</p>







<p>&#8220;No&#8230;? That&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it, Arisa? You don&#8217;t want to get married&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>&#8220;That is not what I meant.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa interrupted Haruto&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>Then in a clear voice, Arisa said.</p>







<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to call off my engagement to Yuzuru-san!!&#8221;</p>







<p>Each of them had a different reaction to those words.</p>



<p>Emi&#8217;s expression twisted in annoyance, Mei displayed a small smile, Naoki&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, and Haruto&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;A-Arisa?　What are you talking about? &#8230;There&#8217;s no need for you to push yourself&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up! &#8230;A bystander should stay out of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;B-bystander&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignoring Haruto, who flinched at the unexpected outburst from Arisa, Arisa turned to Naoki.</p>



<p>While she had tears in her jade-green eyes, Arisa said to Naoki in a strong tone.</p>







<p>&#8220;I want to marry Yuzuru-san. &#8230;Even if you say no, I will definitely marry Yuzuru-san!!&#8221;</p>







<p>Holding back her fear, Arisa clearly expressed her feelings to Naoki.</p>



<p>She was afraid to speak her opinion to Naoki.</p>



<p>But more than that&#8230;, she was afraid of tearing apart her relationship with Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;This girl is being selfish even after all this time!&#8221;</p>







<p>Emi approached Arisa, her voice trembling with anger.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Arisa &#8230;glared at Emi with teary eyes.</p>







<p>Emi stopped in her tracks at Arisa&#8217;s unexpected defiance.　</p>



<p>It&#8217;s because the usual Arisa would have silently turned her face down and let herself be subjected to the treatment.</p>







<p>&#8220;T-this girl&#8230; those eyes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop.&#8221;</p>







<p>Then, perhaps coming to himself, Naoki hurriedly stopped Emi.</p>



<p>He grabbed Emi&#8217;s arm forcefully with his strong hand.</p>



<p>Then he glared at Emi.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you many times not to hit Arisa. &#8230;Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;no, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell that to Arisa.&#8221;</p>







<p>Emi&#8217;s expression twisted in displeasure at Naoki&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>However, she couldn&#8217;t resist her husband&#8217;s words and turned to face Arisa.</p>







<p>“&#8230;I lost my temper. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa brushed off the apology, which was completely devoid of feeling.</p>



<p>She did not have time to deal with Emi right now.</p>







<p>“Naoki-san&#8230; I like Yuzuru-san. I love him. I want to marry him from the bottom of my heart.&#8221;</p>







<p>Then Arisa showed him her left hand.　</p>



<p>The engagement ring on her ring finger was shining.</p>







<p>Naoki&#8217;s eyes widened again, perhaps from too much surprise.</p>



<p>Naoki wasn&#8217;t the only one.</p>



<p>Emi also held her mouth.</p>



<p>And Haruto &#8230;stiffened like a stone from the shock.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san gave it to me today. He proposed to me to make our engagement official. And I &#8230;accepted it.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s cheeks blushed slightly as she said this.</p>



<p>Her mouth loosened and she almost grinned&#8230; But it was not the time to be ecstatic.</p>







<p>&#8220;Certainly&#8230; I didn&#8217;t want to go on matchmaking meetings. That&#8217;s a fact. &#8230;I couldn&#8217;t say no to it, so I reluctantly underwent it. That was also the case with my engagement to Yuzuru-san at first. But now, it&#8217;s different. While I was with him&#8230; I was attracted to him and fell in love with him. I wish to marry Yuzuru-san&#8230; Please&#8230; Please allow me and Yuzuru-san to get married.&#8221;</p>







<p>Then Arisa bowed deeply to Naoki.</p>







<p>Naoki was &#8230;silent.</p>







<p><em>What if he says no?</em></p>



<p><em>What if he gets angry?</em></p>







<p>Unimaginable anxiety struck Arisa.</p>



<p>Her heart thumped so hard that she thought it might burst.</p>







<p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s been a while, huh?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa looked up.</p>



<p>Naoki had &#8230;a very calm expression on his face, contrary to Arisa&#8217;s imagination.</p>



<p>Somehow, he seemed to be happy.</p>







<p>&#8220;Um, what does that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I&#8217;m just a little surprised that it&#8217;s been so long since you&#8217;ve voiced your opinion so clearly.&#8221;</p>







<p>Naoki said, then &#8230;slowly bent his back.</p>



<p>At first, Arisa had no idea what Naoki was doing.</p>



<p>And, Naoki&#8230; bowed his head to Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t realize that I was forcing you into an arranged marriage.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;E, eh!?　U-um&#8230; P-please, stop it&#8230; P-please raise your head!&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa was bewildered by Naoki&#8217;s completely different attitude from usual.</p>



<p>In her mind, Naoki was&#8230; a dignified father with absolute power at home, for better or worse.</p>







<p>&#8220;I should&#8217;ve talked with you more. I was foolish. Please forgive me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I understand&#8230; I-I will forgive you.. so please..&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Please raise your head.</em></p>



<p>When Arisa said that, Naoki slowly raised his head.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my intention to force you to get married. Then I&#8217;ll ask you this&#8230; you wish to marry Yuzuru-kun, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa answered Naoki&#8217;s question clearly.</p>



<p>She looked at Naoki steadily from the front.</p>



<p><em>I see</em>, Naoki nodded quietly.</p>







<p>&#8220;All right. Then&#8230; as a father, I&#8217;ll support your love.&#8221;</p>







<p>At Naoki&#8217;s words, Arisa involuntarily blushed and turned her eyes away.</p>



<p>She felt ashamed now that she had spoken so loudly about her love for Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like&#8230; I&#8217;m in love&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? You&#8217;re not&#8230;?”</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I am.!&#8221;</p>







<p>When Naoki tilted his head, Arisa said loudly, her face turning red.</p>



<p>Then, she clearly expressed her intentions to Naoki.</p>







<p>“Please inform the Takasegawa family and Takasegawa-san to proceed with the engagement of Yuzuru-san and me in earnest.&#8221;</p>







<p>&nbsp;Naoki nodded significantly at Arisa&#8217;s words.</p>







<p>Thus&#8230;, the engagement of Arisa and Yuzuru was officially recognized by the Amagi family.</p>




<p>“Hmm, you guys are so in love after all. Arisa-san, why didn&#8217;t you just say so from the beginning? &#8230;.Please go ahead and explode everlastingly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;P-please stop it, Mei-chan!　Don&#8217;t make fun of me!&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>AN:</strong></p>



<p><em>Those who sleep on their rights are not worthy of protection</em></p>



<p><em>Heaven helps those who help themselves.</em></p>



<p><em>If you are unwilling to help yourself, if you cannot even hold the hand that is extended to you, don&#8217;t you think that you have neither the right nor the value to be helped?</em></p>



<p><em>That&#8217;s why I had Arisa-chan wipe her ass by herself.</em></p>



<p><em>I think she is now a little more suitable to be the bride of the Takasegawa family.</em></p>
