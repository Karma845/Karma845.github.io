<h3>Interlude – Arisa-Chan</h3>

<p><br>When did I fall in love with that person?</p>



<p>Suddenly, I thought back.</p>



<div style="height:100px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The first time I met that person was at the entrance ceremony.</p>



<p>My foster father had given me strict orders to never cause any trouble.</p>



<p>So I knew him from the beginning, and I remember my impression of him very well.</p>



<p>He was a very quiet and calm person.</p>



<p>That was my impression of him, and I think it was the impression of many of my classmates as well.<br> </p>



<p>The girls in my class described him as a cool but quiet guy.<br> </p>



<p>But I never thought of him as a quiet guy.</p>



<p>In hindsight, I thought he was&#8230; scary.<br> </p>



<p>If I had to use an analogy, I would say a big giant tree. Or a dense forest of trees.</p>



<p>It is quiet and calm.</p>



<p>But&#8230;. he has very strong power.<br> </p>



<p>I felt that way.<br> </p>



<p>We were in the same class, but there was no conversation between us.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t want to get involved with men, and he didn&#8217;t seem particularly interested in me.<br> </p>



<p>So I was a little surprised when my adoptive father told me that he wanted to arrange a marriage meeting with me.</p>



<p>He was clearly indifferent to me.<br> </p>



<p>I wondered if he really liked me&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t refuse the matchmaking, so I agreed.<br> </p>



<p>And as expected, my adoptive father had misunderstood that he was hoping for a marriage meeting with me.</p>



<p>On the contrary, he didn&#8217;t seem to want to engage in matchmaking.<br> </p>



<p>I think it was natural.</p>



<p>It is unthinkable for a high school student to get engaged or married,&#8230;<br> </p>



<p>So, maybe.</p>



<p>I thought that he might be willing to listen to my absurd request for a fake engagement.</p>



<p>And as it turns out, he did listen to my request.</p>



<p>To protect me.</p>



<p>He is a kind and caring person.</p>



<p>That added to my impression of him.</p>



<p>If someone asks me if I liked him from that time &#8230;, I don&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>At least, I didn&#8217;t have strong feelings for him at that time.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>The reason I can&#8217;t say for sure is that when I think back on it now, I felt so happy and reliant on his care,&#8230; and it makes my heart ache so much.</p>



<p>Then, as it happened, I started going to his house once a week.</p>



<p>I got to know a lot about him.</p>



<p>I also found myself telling him about myself and my family situation.</p>



<p>When most people find out about my situation, they take two main actions: &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>They either tried to &#8220;greatly take care of me&#8221;, or they run away.</p>



<p>No, this expression may be too convenient for me.</p>



<p>My stepbrother has been a big help from time to time.</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t do much, but he went the extra mile and made things worse for me.</p>



<p>So I started to say I don&#8217;t need help, even though I wanted help.</p>



<p>Because they try to help me when they can&#8217;t help me.</p>



<p>If they did that, my position would be at an even greater disadvantage.</p>



<p>Because I refused the help, people began to turn a blind eye or run away.</p>



<p>I want help, but I don&#8217;t want to be helped.</p>



<p>I wanted help, in a convenient spoonful amount, in a convenient way.</p>



<p>I think this was really selfish, self-serving, and arrogant thinking.</p>



<p>There is no way that there is a convenient prince on a white horse, who would understand my weak, wimpy intentions and carry them out.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no way there would be one&#8230;</p>



<p>But he did exactly that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He said he would help me.</p>



<p>He tried to help me as much as he could.</p>



<p>But he didn&#8217;t do anything forceful that would put me at a disadvantage.</p>



<p>Maybe I&#8217;m overstating the case.</p>



<p>It could be a coincidence.</p>



<p>&nbsp;　</p>



<p>But even so,.. he looked at me carefully, understood my intentions without saying a word, respected my wishes, and did what I wanted him to do.</p>



<p>I felt that this person would protect me.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>I came to have such a sense of security.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I went with him on a date to the pool.</p>



<p>And there, Ayaka-san and Chiharu-san, who happened to meet me, asked me,</p>



<p><em>Are you in love with him?</em></p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know when I first fell in love with him.</p>



<p>But when did I first become aware of it&#8230;? It must be at that time.</p>



<p>First of all, I was very relieved to know that Ayaka-san and Chiharu-san already had a boyfriend (? . if he is their boyfriend, that means Satake-san is two-timing, and those two are allowing it. I am not so sure, but that&#8217;s not important here.)</p>



<p>It was a great relief to be able to confirm that there was no such relationship or feeling between him and Ayaka-san or Chiharu-san.</p>



<p>In addition, when Ayaka and Chiharu asked me if I had any feelings for Yuzuru-san &#8230;, I became aware.</p>



<p>I am in love with him.</p>



<p>And on the day of the summer festival, it became definitive.<br> </p>



<p>He forgave me for my &#8220;lie&#8221;.</p>



<p>I can trust him.　</p>



<p>I felt safe.</p>



<p>I could surrender myself to him.<br> </p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I thought.<br> </p>



<p>I was thrilled when he hugged me.</p>



<p>I felt relieved when he stroked my head.</p>



<p>On the other hand, I was tempted to stroke his head and play tricks on him.<br> </p>



<p>It was clear to me that this was love.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if he also liked me in the same way&#8230;<br> </p>



<p>But he protected me from my mother and was happy with my poor birthday present.<br> </p>



<p>So&#8230; I felt a bit of guilt.</p>



<p>Because I haven&#8217;t been able to give anything back to him.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s always helping me&#8230;, without me asking for help myself.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an act that puts all the blame on him.<br> </p>



<p>&nbsp;It made me feel very ugly.<br> </p>



<p>So&#8230; I went and poured it out on him.</p>



<p>That I am an ugly person.</p>



<p>And that he doesn&#8217;t know it.</p>



<p>I was really reckless, egotistical, and selfish.<br> </p>



<p>But he accepted me for who I was.</p>



<p>He knew that I was an ugly person, and he affirmed it.<br> </p>



<p>I still felt sorry for myself.　</p>



<p>However, my heart felt lighter.<br> </p>



<p>At the same time, I felt that I had to give something back to him.</p>



<p>I thought that I had to do something for him, not just be done for.<br> </p>



<p>However, the only thing I could do for him was to make him bento&#8230;</p>



<p>But he was happy to receive it.</p>



<p>He always said it was delicious.<br> </p>



<p>I can continue to make lunch for him.</p>



<p>I want to make dinner for him every day.<br> </p>



<p>I even started to think about it.</p>



<p>Then, on Christmas Day, he asked me to continue cooking for him.<br> </p>



<p>I thought it was like a marriage proposal.<br> </p>



<p>Of course, he didn&#8217;t mean it as a marriage proposal.</p>



<p>But even if it had been a proposal, I would have nodded my head in agreement.</p>



<p>I was happy and accepted.<br></p>



<p>At that time, I thought to myself,</p>



<p><em>I could marry this man.</em><br> </p>



<p>With him, I could imagine getting married, becoming a couple, having children, growing old together, and being surrounded by grandchildren.</p>



<p>Marriage with him, which I had tried not to think about until now, was becoming a reality.</p>



<p>As I looked at the necklace he gave me, I began to envision my married life with him.<br> </p>



<p>I had a sneaking suspicion that he liked me.</p>



<p>I could tell by looking at the necklace.<br> </p>



<p>The necklace he gave me was brand new and very nice.</p>



<p>At first glance, I understood.</p>



<p>That he knows my taste&#8230; That he listened carefully and remembered what I told him when we had a date to the cinema before.</p>



<p>And that necklace is a very expensive item.</p>



<p>He was working part-time to make ends meet, so it wouldn&#8217;t be a cheap purchase for him.<br> </p>



<p>He would never give something like that to a woman he didn&#8217;t like.<br> </p>



<p>So he must like me&#8230;</p>



<p>My relationship with him is a fake &#8220;fiancé&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, this is based on the premise that there is no affection between me and him, and that we will break off our engagement once I am able to live on my own.<br> </p>



<p>That assumption has been broken.</p>



<p>I like him.</p>



<p>He likes me.<br> </p>



<p>Then, we should continue our relationship.</p>



<p>If we do that, we&#8217;ll eventually become normal fiancées and get married &#8230;<br> </p>



<p>It was when I was thinking such a thing.<br> </p>



<p>Suddenly, my foster father told me.　</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>If you don&#8217;t like it, then it is fine not to get married.</em>&#8220;<br> </p>
