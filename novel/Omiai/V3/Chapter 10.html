<h3>Chapter 10 – Kyun~</h3>
		
<p>The next day.</p>


<p>&#8220;The fever&#8217;s gone, so that&#8217;s a relief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru said that, Arisa replied, hiding her face half under the covers for some reason.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s been like this since this morning.</p>



<p>Probably&#8230; because she was embarrassed.</p>



<p>Her ears were bright red as proof.</p>



<p>For what reason she was embarrassed, Yuzuru could somehow guess the answer.</p>



<p>The other day, Arisa was acting a little strange.</p>



<p>She was proactively trying to get spoiled by Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s just that she&#8217;s usually too cautious, and the spoiled girl from the other day was the &#8220;real&#8221; Arisa.</p>







<p>“&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry for the trouble I caused you yesterday.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said this while hiding her face.</p>



<p>And then she glanced at him and checked how he was faring.</p>



<p>The gesture was quite flirty and cute&#8230; and it made Yuzuru also feel embarrassed.</p>







<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; I hope that&#8217;s the case.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Then that&#8217;s ok.</em></p>



<p>But even as she said this, Arisa was still looking at Yuzuru.</p>



<p>She still seemed to be worried about something.</p>







<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up? &#8230; I&#8217;ll listen to whatever you request.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; <em>Yuzuru-san no baka.</em>&#8220;</p>







<p>As Arisa said this, she pulled the covers over her head.</p>



<p><em>No matter how embarrassed she was, why did she have to scold me?</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle.</p>





<p>Then, the next day, Monday.</p>



<p>When Yuzuru arrived at school, he found Arisa already in the classroom.</p>



<p>Her fever had already gone down on Sunday morning, but she seemed to have recovered completely without any recurrence.</p>







<p>For a moment, Yuzuru and Arisa&#8217;s eyes met.</p>



<p>Then she smiled slightly.</p>







<p>Then, as Yuzuru took his seat&#8230;his smartphone rang.</p>



<p>He looked at it and saw that it was a text from Arisa.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Thank you for the other day&#8221;],&nbsp; with a cute stamp.</p>



<p>Yuzuru also sent a text saying, [&#8220;Take it easy, okay?&#8221;].</p>







<p>The response was immediate.</p>







<p>[&#8220;If I collapse, please help me again.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Yuzuru judged that it was probably a joke since it was accompanied by a cute stamp.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Leave it to me. Do you want me to carry you to the infirmary then?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Since you&#8217;re being generous, please take me home.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Is it okay if I carry you like a princess?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;It is okay, but do you have the strength for that?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;Are you that heavy?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;That&#8217;s very rude.&#8221;]</p>







<p>A stamp with an angry face came back.</p>







<p>Yuzuru almost laughed and held his mouth.</p>



<p>If he grinned here, he would be one of those creepy guys who grins and smiles while playing with his cell phone.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best for you.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8221; &#8216;Doing your best&#8217; makes it sound like I&#8217;m heavy, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8230; &#8220;]</p>







<p>The reply that he would do his best also seemed to be unsatisfying to Arisa.</p>







<p>By the way, Arisa&#8217;s weight was not heavy, but it was not as light as a feather either.</p>



<p>While not going into specifics, Arisa does have some flesh on her body where flesh is supposed to be.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that she doesn&#8217;t have any muscles, because she seems to be exercising more or less regularly.</p>



<p>She had a healthy weight in her body.</p>







<p>[&#8220;You weren&#8217;t heavy.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8221; I lifted you on the day before yesterday.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Yuzuru replied, and after a moment of silence, a reply came back.</p>







<p>[&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;]</p>







<p><em>Now, what kind of expression does Arisa have on her face right now?</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru was a little curious, but as expected, if he were to check her expression, people might find out that he and Arisa were communicating via cell phone.</p>



<p>It was not his intention to do so, so he had to endure it.　</p>



<p>It was very frustrating.</p>







<p>[&#8220;How was it?&#8221;]</p>







<p>Finally, the message that came back was a question asking for his impressions.</p>







<p>What exactly should he say?</p>



<p>Yuzuru pondered a little.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;Well, I guess it was soft.</em>)</p>







<p>When he picked her up, what he felt was softness.</p>



<p>It was a very girlish softness, even though various parts of her body were touched by force majeure.</p>



<p>And then&#8230;</p>







<p>(<em>It was cute&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>She grabbed Yuzuru&#8217;s clothes and looked up at me with moist eyes, which was very cute and endearing.</p>



<p>It was clear to him that she was relying on him, as she was physically and mentally weak after catching a cold.</p>







<p>He felt a strong desire to protect her mixed with a desire to conquer her.</p>



<p><em>I will protect Arisa.</em></p>



<p>It was a bit presumptuous of him, but such a desire came to him.</p>



<p>However, he couldn&#8217;t just say that outright.</p>



<p>Also, given the context&#8230; It was probably a question about Arisa&#8217;s weight.</p>







<p>[&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a reasonable weight.&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;That&#8217;s sexual harassment.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Such an answer came back to him immediately.</p>



<p><em>In the first place, you were the one who first made fun of me asking if I have that kind of muscle strength. And you were the one who persisted in talking about weight&#8230;</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru felt that it was a bit unreasonable.</p>



<p>So, as both payback and a prank, he decided to ask a question of his own.</p>







<p>[&#8220;How was it for you?&#8221;]</p>







<p>If you&#8217;re going to ask someone for impressions, you have to answer them, too.</p>



<p>And so, with such a nasty thought, Yuzuru sent such a text.</p>







<p>As expected, she seemed to be at a loss for an answer, and after being read, she didn&#8217;t reply.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt a sense of frustration as he waited for Arisa&#8217;s answer.</p>



<p>But with no answer from Arisa&#8230; It was time for the short homeroom to start in a few minutes.</p>



<p><em>Could it be that I&#8217;ve angered her?</em></p>







<p>just as when Yuzuru started to feel a little uneasy,&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer came back from Arisa.</p>







<p>[&#8220;It made me go &#8216;kyun~&#8217;.&#8221;]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>(</em><strong><em>TN: ‘</em></strong><em>Going Kyun’ means it made her feel like squirming with emotions like joy and shyness and stuff like that. )</em></p>







<p>Yuzuru also felt a bit of &#8220;kyun~&#8221; in his heart.</p>



<p>His heart thumped noisily in his chest.</p>



<p>He was tempted to check to see &#8230;what kind of expression she had typed this sentence with.</p>



<p>[&#8220;Can I rely on you again? &#8230; when I have a cold.&#8221;]</p>







<p>Then came the next message.</p>



<p>Somehow, Yuzuru felt that the first half of the message was Airisa&#8217;s true feelings, while the second half was an excuse or a cover-up.</p>







<p>Yuzuru immediately typed back.</p>







<p>[&#8220;That&#8217;s no problem at all, Princess.&#8221;</p>




<p>[&#8220;&#8230;Isn&#8217;t it embarrassing, to say that?&#8221;]</p>



<p>[&#8220;It&#8217;s embarrassing when people point it out, so please stop.&#8221;]</p>
