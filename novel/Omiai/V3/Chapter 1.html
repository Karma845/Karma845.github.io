<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Worst! Scum! Die!</h3>

<p>December, the 28th.</p>



<p>It was the end of the year,</p>



<p>Yuzuru and his two male friends, Soichiro Satake and Hijiri Ryozenji decided to hang out together.</p>



<p>And while having lunch at a random family restaurant.</p>



<p>Yuzuru suddenly announced to them,</p>





<p>&#8220;I seriously fell in love with Arisa.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Soichiro and Hijiri looked at each other.</p>



<p>Then&#8230;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;O, oh, &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; now you are saying that?&#8221;<br></p>



<p><em>Finally, you&#8217;ve realized you&#8217;re in love.</em></p>



<p>That was the expression on their faces.</p>



<p>But Yuzuru ignored them and started talking on his own.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;On Christmas Day, I realized&#8230; I didn&#8217;t want to give her to anyone else.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;What are you trying to tell us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa is my girl, so don&#8217;t try to touch her even by mistake, okay?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>In short, he drove the point into them.</p>



<p>Soichiro and Hijiri are both men with sufficiently good-looking faces, even from Yuzuru&#8217;s eyes as a man.</p>



<p>Of course, they are not the kind of people who would mess with someone&#8217;s &#8220;fiancée&#8221;&#8230;</p>



<p>They may think that Arisa is a beautiful woman to admire, but they wouldn&#8217;t want her to be their girlfriend.<br></p>



<p>But&#8230;</p>



<p>It seems that when people fall in love, even the most trivial things bother them and they get jealous.</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but warn them.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to tell me&#8230; I&#8217;m busy taking care of Ayaka and Chiharu. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Soichiro said this with a calm expression.</p>



<p>‘I wonder if this guy will get stabbed to death ‘, Yuzuru and Hijiri thought.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to mess with my friend&#8217;s girl either, but&#8230; if I do, what will happen?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Half-jokingly.　</p>



<p>Hijiri asked Yuzuru in a somewhat playful tone.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re scaring me!　Don&#8217;t say that in a low voice!&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru meant it as a joke, but his voice came out lower than he expected.</p>



<p>After all, he couldn&#8217;t joke about it.</p>



<p>Once again, Yuzuru vowed that he would make sure that Arisa would be his.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;So, what are you going to do?　Are you going to ask&#8230; &#8216;Please go out with me&#8217; or something? Even though you&#8217;re already engaged?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Well, that would certainly be a weird thing to do.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>What confuses the relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa is the fact that she is his fiancée.</p>



<p>They are not just lovers, they are engaged to be married.</p>



<p>Of course, both of them were going to break it off in the future&#8230;.or were supposed to.</p>



<p>The current Yuzuru does not want to break off the engagement, though.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;If you confess to Yukishiro now, it&#8217;s practically like asking her to marry you.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Soichiro pointed out calmly.</p>



<p>The relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa as &#8220;fiancée&#8221; is established on the premise that they do not love each other.</p>



<p>But if that premise is broken, they will become just &#8230;. normal fiancées.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;. Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, I think Arisa likes me.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>When Yuzuru said this, Soichiro and Hijiri nodded.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;From the outsider’s point of view, you guys are just an idiot couple.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, we’re not&#8230; Well, whatever&#8221;<br></p>



<p>While Yuzuru regretted this, he could not move forward with his discussion by arguing about it.</p>



<p>So he just gave up and moved on with the conversation.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;But if I ask her to marry me &#8230;. or she asks me if I&#8217;ll marry her&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You guys are high school students&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s heavy.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Arisa is a smart girl.</p>



<p>That is why Yuzuru fell in love with her&#8230; And because she is a smart girl, she will not act rashly.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;If I may advise you, the sooner the better.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Suddenly, Soichiro began to say something like that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s as if Soichiro himself has confessed his love to someone before and failed in the past.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Hey, Soichiro.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Well, I told Ayaka. on Christmas.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Soichiro said in a crisp tone.</p>



<p>The distance between Soichiro and Ayaka is very close.</p>



<p>They are childhood friends, but they are even closer than that… The two of them have maintained that relationship ever since they were children.</p>



<p><br>&#8220;So, how did it go?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8216;eh? But we&#8217;re already lovers.&#8217; &#8230; is what she said&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; &#8220;<br></p>



<p>Soichiro and Ayaka were indeed lovers for a long time.</p>



<p>While Yuzuru and Hijiri have been making fun of it&#8230; Ayaka herself seems to have been aware of it.</p>



<p>&#8230; No, when you think back, her words and actions were clearly a recognition that she was Soichiro&#8217;s lover.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;When she put it that way, well, it made sense to me, too&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t notice?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Getting used to it is a scary thing.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru and Hijiri were dumbfounded&#8230;</p>



<p>But when they thought about it, that sense of distance had been the norm for both of them since they were born.</p>



<p>Because they had been lovers from the beginning, their awareness of being lovers must have been vague.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;And here&#8217;s the important part, okay?　Then Ayaka hit me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Why?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You never got stabbed before, so why did she hit you all of a sudden?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>His confession came up empty, but that was because it had already paid off.</p>



<p>Why had Soichiro been beaten up by Ayaka when their romance was already fulfilled?</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Hijiri tilted their heads.<br></p>



<p>&#8221; &#8216;Did you really think I was the kind of woman who would do that to a man who wasn&#8217;t her lover?　You would do something like that to a woman who is not your girlfriend?　You&#8217;re the worst!　Idiot!　Scum!　Seducer!　Die!&#8217; was what she told me while scolding&#8221;</p>



<p>“Isn&#8217;t that obvious?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just die, man.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up, I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>When Yuzuru and Hijiri stirred him up, Soichiro started to get upset.</p>



<p>However&#8230;</p>



<p>If Soichiro&#8217;s story is correct, Soichiro and Ayaka are now in a state of quarrel and seclusion.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;So how are you going to die and apologize?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You want to commit seppuku like a samurai?　Shall I assist you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am not going to die&#8230; I got Chiharu to mediate for me, so I managed somehow. No need to worry about it.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>It seems that something has been done.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Hijiri were relieved.</p>



<p>At least, they hope that their friend will be happy, even if he is a scumbag. Yes, even if he is a scumbag.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you know what? If you don&#8217;t want to end up like me, you&#8217;d better make sure you&#8217;ve made the right decision. If you keep dipping into lukewarm water just because it feels good, you&#8217;ll end up like a boiled frog.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll keep that in mind.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Soichiro&#8217;s scumbag episode was more informative than expected.</p>



<p>&#8230; Though when thinking back on it calmly, it doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s already too late.</p>



<div style="height:100px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Soichiro. What are you planning to do with Chiharu?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? &#8230; Well, don&#8217;t worry. I can&#8217;t tell you the details yet &#8230;&#8230;.but we&#8217;ll figure it out.&#8221;</p>



<p>“&#8230; Really?　Before you talk to Yuzuru about lessons learned, you should first make use of your experience, right?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru and Hijiri were very worried that Soichiro would be boiled to death in a pot.</p>
