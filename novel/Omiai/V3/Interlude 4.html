<h3>Interlude – Engagement Annulment</h3>

<p>&#8220;I am back.&#8221;</p>





<p>Evening.</p>



<p>After the sun went down, Arisa returned home.</p>



<p>There was no reply.</p>



<p>But that didn&#8217;t mean no one was home.</p>



<p>She walked slowly and a tad bit gravely to the dining room and kitchen.</p>



<p>Her foster mother, Emi Amagi, was in the kitchen washing the dishes.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back. &#8230;Emi-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>It&#8217;s usually Arisa&#8217;s job to cook dinner.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s a specific rule, but it&#8217;s customary for Arisa to make it.</p>



<p>Today, however, she came home late because she had to have dinner with Yuzuru.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Emi unusually cooked dinner.</p>



<p>Of course, Arisa had informed her about it in advance&#8230;</p>



<p>Even so, she felt a little heavy-hearted.</p>



<p>On the other hand, when Emi was approached by Arisa, she continued washing the dishes and replied without turning around.</p>







<p>&#8220;Oh, welcome home. &#8230;You&#8217;re quite late returning home.&#8221;</p>







<p>The sarcasm came immediately.</p>



<p>Arisa replied, thinking inwardly that it was troublesome.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience.&#8221;</p>



<p>“No, I didn&#8217;t think it was any trouble at all&#8230;You were busy, weren&#8217;t you?　With a lot of things to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>It was an implying tone.</p>



<p>However, Arisa, who has learned that if she takes it seriously or refutes it; it will come back to her several times over, let her words slide.</p>







<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll take my leave&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>She wanted to go back to her room and go to sleep, so she tried to leave.</p>



<p>Emi hurled a few words at Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;Oh, and &#8230;please wash your dirty body before you go to bed. Also, don&#8217;t put your dirty &#8216;underwear&#8217;&#8230; in the same washing machine.&#8221;</p>







<p>Emi&#8217;s intentions were clear when she limited her words to &#8220;underwear&#8221; instead of &#8220;dirty clothes&#8221;.</p>



<p>Emi assumed that Arisa had &#8220;slept&#8221; with Yuzuru.</p>







<p>“&#8230;yes, I understand.&#8221;</p>







<p>However, since she was just being sarcastic, Arisa didn&#8217;t know if she really meant it or not, and it was not important either.</p>



<p>Therefore, it was useless to correct her.</p>



<p>Besides&#8230;</p>







<p>(<em>Well, there&#8217;s little point in correcting&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>If her relationship with Yuzuru was a misunderstanding, Arisa would be tempted to deny it&#8230;</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t that much of a misconception either</p>



<p>Arisa did as she was told and went to the bathroom to take a shower.</p>







<p>&#8220;That person &#8230;has become a little mature&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>To tell the truth, Emi&#8217;s sarcasm was a bit of a letdown for Arisa.</p>



<p>Not so long ago, she would have said something much worse.</p>



<p>Emi&#8217;s &#8220;verbal knife&#8221; was clearly losing its sharpness.</p>



<p>This was probably due to the fact that the relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa was going well.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not as if Yuzuru was putting any special pressure on her&#8230;</p>



<p>But his family name was indeed a shield that protects Arisa.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;I feel sorry that I am always getting saved by him.</em>)</p>







<p>Thinking about it, she received a very expensive gift for Christmas.</p>



<p>If someone asks her if she has been able to repay the gift with something adequate, Arisa cannot affirm with confidence that she did.</p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru might say that she doesn&#8217;t need to return the favor&#8230;</p>







<p>(<em>As a person &#8230;I don&#8217;t want to be corrupted&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>If she continues to rely on him and keep receiving gifts from him, she will definitely be corrupted.　</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t want to be the kind of person whose only value was having a great lover.</p>



<p>After getting out of the shower, Arisa quickly wiped off her body, changed into her nightgown, and dried her hair.</p>







<p>She left the changing room and headed for her room.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s room was originally a storage room that was renovated.</p>







<p>The reason for this is not that Arisa was treated very badly, but rather that a &#8220;third child&#8221; was an irregularity for the Amagi couple.</p>



<p>They are a middle-class family, and they don&#8217;t have a lot of money like the Takasegawa and Tachibana families. So they couldn&#8217;t afford to build another room for Arisa.</p>



<p>However, even though it was a storage room, the structure of the room, such as insulation, was the same as the other rooms, and the air conditioning was working properly, so Arisa had no particular complaints.</p>







<p>As she walked down the hallway&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa&#8230; you&#8217;re back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. A little while ago.&#8221;</p>







<p>She ran into her cousin, Haruto Amagi.</p>



<p>Right now, he was back at his parents&#8217; house because his university was on spring break.</p>







<p>(<em>I hope he returns soon&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>Originally, Arisa did not have a good impression of Haruto&#8230;</p>



<p>Ever since she found out that he was behind the incident involving her former classmate, her impression of him had plummeted.</p>



<p><em>&#8216;Hurry up and go back to your college apartment&#8217;</em></p>



<p>She thought to herself regularly</p>



<p>Of course, she doesn&#8217;t say it out loud.</p>







<p>&#8220;I heard&#8230; there was a marathon today, but you returned very late.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. Is there a problem with that?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa replied in a cold voice.</p>



<p>As expected, Haruto seemed to notice that Arisa was in a bad mood and flinched.</p>







<p>“N-no&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry. That was an inconsiderate thing to ask.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa frowned at him.</p>



<p>She realized that he flinched &#8230;because he apparently had a strange misunderstanding.</p>



<p>Somehow it made Arisa feel uncomfortable.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like anything was going on with Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-is that so&#8230; That&#8217;s good&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>The misunderstanding did not seem to have been cleared up.</p>



<p>Arisa, who was troubled, quickly cut off the conversation and tried to return to her room &#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa.. I&#8217;ll help you as much as I can!&#8221;</p>







<p>He grabbed her arm while saying that.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;What are you talking about?&#8221;　</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean&#8230; It&#8217;s about that&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Haruto&#8217;s expression twisted a bit as if he was having a hard time saying it&#8230;</p>



<p>But he looked straight at Arisa and answered.</p>







<p>“It&#8217;s about &#8230;the engagement. You don&#8217;t have to do what that guy says&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>At that moment, Arisa felt the blood rush to her head.</p>







<p>“Can you please stop saying bad things about Yuzuru-san?&#8221;</p>







<p>Her voice came out loudly.</p>



<p>When she saw the stunned Haruto, Arisa huffed.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;</p>







<p>She bowed slightly and headed for her room to escape.</p>







<p>Then&#8230;</p>







<p>“It&#8217;s rare to see you fight.&#8221;</p>







<p>A girl was standing in front of her room.</p>



<p>She was Arisa&#8217;s cousin and stepsister.</p>



<p>Mei Amagi.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; Mei-chan&#8230; Did I interrupt your study?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was just playing with my phone, it&#8217;s fine. Ah &#8230;please don&#8217;t tell mother.&#8221;</p>







<p>One hour of gaming a day.</p>



<p>This was the family rule that Emi Amagi had created.</p>



<p>Emi doesn&#8217;t like games.</p>



<p>Arisa has never played many games because of this family policy of the Amagi family.</p>



<p>But&#8230; even if Emi can manage the game console, she can&#8217;t fully understand the games played on cell phones, which is a communication device.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Mei, who has a good head on her shoulders, used to play games on her cell phone without her mother&#8217;s knowledge.</p>



<p>In fact, she would secretly beg her father to let her play even games where a small payment was required.</p>



<p>She had a dexterity that Arisa could not imitate.</p>







<p>&#8220;And also, I would like to have a word with you, Arisa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;you wanted to talk to me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Well, it&#8217;s about the engagement.”</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s expression tensed up involuntarily.　</p>



<p>Ignoring her, Mei proceeded with the conversation on her own.</p>







<p>&#8220;Actually, father asked me if I could take your place if&#8230; the engagement between Arisa-san and Takasegawa-san were to be annulled. Ah&#8230; no, of course, he said it in a more considerate way.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s mind went blank.</p>



<p>But somehow, she managed to squeeze out the words.</p>







<p>&#8220;Th-that ..um&#8230; in what sense?&#8221;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s just a hypothetical situation&#8230; like, if either Arisa-san or Takasegawa-san, or both, dislike the other and the engagement is in trouble. So this is the backup plan.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa was relieved to hear Mei&#8217;s words and patted her chest.</p>



<p>Apparently, it was not as if the engagement had been called off.</p>







<p>(<em>Ah&#8230; speaking of which&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>She remembered that her adoptive father, Naoki, had asked her if she disliked being engaged.</p>



<p>In response to this, &#8230;Arisa could not give a clear reply.</p>



<p>She was not sure what his intentions were.</p>



<p>She wanted to answer &#8220;No&#8221; immediately, but&#8230;</p>



<p>She was a little scared thinking that maybe answering &#8220;yes&#8221; was what Naoki wanted.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why she was reluctant to answer, so she decided to &#8220;escape&#8221; by not answering.</p>



<p>Naoki said, &#8220;You can answer me later&#8221;. But she didn&#8217;t have a chance to talk to him after that, so it remained unanswered.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is that so? So, what about you, Mei-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t really thought that I want to marry Takasegawa-san. I&#8217;ve never even met him in person&#8230; And I want to take over my father&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>







<p>Since Haruto and Naoki don&#8217;t get along &#8211; technically Haruto dislikes Naoki unilaterally &#8211; Haruto went to a department that has little to do with Naoki&#8217;s company.</p>



<p>He had little desire to take over the company, and Naoki does not want to force him to do so.</p>



<p>Mei, on the other hand, seemed to have some intention to take over the company.</p>



<p>But she&#8217;s still in the sixth grade, so it was unsure how she&#8217;ll turn out.</p>







<p>&#8220;I-is that so?&#8221;</p>







<p>No matter what Naoki&#8217;s intentions were, as long as Mei didn&#8217;t want to, Arisa was the only one who could marry Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, but&#8230; marrying Takasegawa-san doesn&#8217;t mean that I won&#8217;t be able to take over the company either&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve never met him in person, but from the pictures I&#8217;ve seen&#8230; he seems like a very cool guy. And, his personality &#8211; well my brother is saying that it is bad, but that is just a minority opinion- seems okay to me.&#8221;</p>







<p>Mei then smiled slightly.</p>







<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s rich, after all. Well, if Arisa-san doesn&#8217;t like this engagement&#8230; I am not reluctant to marry him. But of course, I have to meet him in person and talk to him first.&#8221;</p>







<p>Mei then asked the stunned Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;With that being said, Arisa-san. How do you really feel about getting married to Takasegawa-san?&#8221;</p>



<img src="https://imgtr.ee/images/2022/12/05/VQPz.jpg" height= "560" width= "400"></img>



<p>Arisa could not answer Mei&#8217;s question immediately.</p>



<p>If Mei was willing to get engaged to Yuzuru, and if Naoki thought Mei was more suitable than Arisa, then&#8230;</p>



<p>At least Arisa didn&#8217;t have the courage to say no.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, um&#8230; What about Mei-chan?&#8221;</p>




<p>She could not say yes or no.</p>



<p>Therefore, Arisa chose to &#8220;escape&#8221; by answering the question with a question.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s asking. I mean, I told you earlier what my intentions are&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Mei made a dumbstruck expression.</p>



<p>She then sighed at Arisa, who kept her mouth shut.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s fine&#8230; Marriage is a long way off, and I think it would be strange to give an answer right now. I am also reluctant to decide on a future partner at this age.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>But, isn&#8217;t it best if you make your intentions clear?</em></p>



<p><em>However, if you feel that you don&#8217;t care either way, that&#8217;s a different case though.</em></p>







<p>After saying that, Mei left the place.</p>



<p>Arisa, who was left behind, silently went into her room and closed the door.</p>







<p>And&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>She leaned her back against the door and muttered the name of her beloved as if to ask for help.</p>


<p><br></p>


<p><strong>AN:</strong></p>



<p><em>Arisa-chan is quiet when it comes to people who seem stronger than her.</em></p>



<p><em>On the other hand, she is strong against those who seem to be weaker than her.</em></p>



<p><em>Yuzuru-kun is a stronger opponent than herself in Arisa&#8217;s eyes, but because he is kind and has helped her on a daily basis, he is judged as safe.</em></p>
