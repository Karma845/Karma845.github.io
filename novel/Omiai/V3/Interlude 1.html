<h3>Interlude – Protest from Takasegawa</h3>

<p>The day that Arisa Yukishiro and Naoki Amagi went to the Takasegawa family to greet them.</p>



<p>Haruto Amagi, who had returned to his parent’s home, was having a very anxious time.</p>



<p>The reason, of course, was that Arisa had gone to the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>In Haruto Amagi&#8217;s mind, Arisa was sold to the Takasegawa family in exchange for a large sum of money.</p>



<p>And he was worried that the people of the Takasegawa family would do something terrible to her.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re worrying too much&#8230; Onii-sama&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>The one who rebuked Haruto was Mei Amagi.</p>



<p>She is in the sixth grade.</p>



<p>She is the younger sister of Haruto, who is seven years older than her.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;From what I can see&#8230; Arisa-san doesn&#8217;t seem to be displeased.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Then Mei thought of Arisa&#8217;s recent behavior.</p>



<p>She was sitting in her room, a renovated storage room, all day long, smiling at the necklace that her fiancé had bought her as a gift.</p>



<p>As a step-sister, it&#8217;s fine that her sister is happy.</p>



<p>But &#8230; it was a little, no, a lot unpleasant.</p>



<p>(<em>That&#8217;s probably a branded product&#8230; Good for you, Arisa-san</em>)<br></p>



<p>In the world, the Amagi family is considered to be a wealthy family.</p>



<p>In reality, however, they do not have a lot of money.</p>



<p>Of course, they can maintain a middle-class lifestyle, but&#8230;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s quite a tall order.</p>



<p>At the very least, an elementary school student like Mei would never be able to afford branded goods.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. How could Arisa say no?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>She&#8217;s just hiding her true feelings.</p>



<p>The truth is, she must not like it.</p>



<p>When he said it like that, Mei couldn&#8217;t deny it.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, that may be true.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Mei, a child, doesn&#8217;t know the story behind this political marriage, but &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>She had a dim idea that there is a great deal of money involved.</p>



<p>Considering Arisa&#8217;s personality, she wouldn&#8217;t be able to refuse.</p>



<p>When Haruto and Mei were talking about this&#8230;<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Hm&#8230;There were a lot of choices, you know. There is no sense in saying that she doesn’t like it now.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>It was Emi Amagi who interrupted the conversation, sniffling unhappily.</p>



<p>She was their mother.</p>



<p>It is a known fact that she hates Arisa very much.</p>



<p>In particular, she is very unhappy about this &#8220;engagement&#8221;.</p>



<p>Although she had said she would accept a marriage proposal, she had repeatedly turned it down, and she didn&#8217;t like Arisa&#8217;s attitude and behavior when it came to choosing between men.</p>



<p>And, although Haruto and Mei don&#8217;t know it&#8230; the fact that she took Yuzuru Takasegawa, Mei&#8217;s fiancé, who is originally her own child, also irritated her.</p>



<p>In addition, it is annoying that Arisa is acting like a tragic heroine and telling Yuzuru Takasegawa how bad she is ( supposedly ).</p>



<p>Her behavior and attitude strongly reminded Emi of her mother, Emi&#8217;s sister.<br> </p>



<p>“Don&#8217;t bother talking about it.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>It was fortunate that the unpleasant presence of Arisa was not there.</p>



<p>It seemed that Emi was uncomfortable with the fact that the children were talking about it &#8211; and that they were worried about Arisa.</p>



<p>She forcefully ended the conversation between Haruto and Mei.</p>



<p>The two of them, unable to take a strong stand against their mother, did as they were told and ended the conversation.<br></p>



<p>Although&#8230; Haruto was not happy about it.</p>



<div style="height:128px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The night of that day.<br> </p>



<p>After Emi, Arisa and Mei had gone to bed&#8230;, Naoki and Haruto were facing each other.</p>



<p>“&#8230; So, Dad. What is it that you want to talk about?&#8221;</p>



<p>With a disgruntled look on his face, Haruto asked Naoki.<br></p>



<p>Unusually, Naoki called out to Haruto saying, &#8220;I need to talk to you&#8221;.</p>



<p>It is usually a sermon when Naoki says to Haruto or Mei that he wants to talk to them.</p>



<p>For Haruto, who is still somewhat rebellious in college, a lecture from his father is not something he feels comfortable with.</p>



<p>Especially if he didn&#8217;t know what he was talking about.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Around November of last year, I received a formal protest from Takasegawa-san. Do you have any idea what happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; I don&#8217;t remember doing anything particularly wrong&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Haruto frowned in displeasure.</p>



<p>For Haruto, who had already identified Takasegawa as his enemy, anything involving the Takasegawa family or Arisa&#8217;s marriage was something he did not want to hear.</p>



<p>Besides, the last time Haruto had met Yuzuru was during the summer vacation.</p>



<p>The timing was off.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I heard you told a stranger about the marriage between our two families. Have you not?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>When he was told that, Haruto finally understood the purpose of this sermon.</p>



<p>It seemed that what he had told Shota Kobayashi about Arisa&#8217;s marriage had been passed on to the Takasegawa family.<br> </p>



<p>There will be no official announcement yet regarding the marriage of Yuzuru Takasegawa and Arisa Yukishiro.　</p>



<p>This has been the policy of both families.</p>



<p>Therefore, they must not talk about it to others lightly.</p>



<p>However&#8230; it is not something that must be kept absolutely secret.</p>



<p>Not only famous families like Tachibana, Uenishi, and Satake but also lawmakers like Kaihara have probably already heard about this marriage.</p>



<p>There was no need to hide the information.</p>



<p>But the people involved in both families must not say anything.</p>



<p>It will remain an open secret&#8230; That was the promise made between the two families.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8230;I just talked to a friend of Arisa&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>From Haruto&#8217;s point of view, it was really ridiculous.</p>



<p>If everyone knows about it anyway, there&#8217;s no need to keep quiet about it.</p>



<p>In the first place, Arisa&#8217;s friend Shota Kobayashi is not a stranger.</p>



<p>That was Haruto’s point.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I call a stranger.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Naoki easily dismissed Haruto&#8217;s excuses.</p>



<p>Then he said in an indifferent, strong tone.<br> </p>



<p>“ I told you that this marriage was important to the company, to both families, and Arisa. So what if it breaks up because of your careless actions?&#8221;</p>



<p>“If this is the kind of engagement that will be broken off because of this, then you shouldn&#8217;t have done it in the first place!&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Haruto, who wanted the engagement to break up in the first place, retorted.</p>



<p>Naoki sighed in response.<br> </p>



<p>“That&#8217;s not the only problem. I heard that you told a lie to a boy who admired Arisa. I heard that because of that, the boy tried to harm Arisa and Takasegawa&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>In reality, Ayumi just argued with him and tore him to pieces.</p>



<p>But the possibility of harming her cannot be denied.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, who appeared to be calm but was quite pissed off, reported the incident to his parents in a way that could be taken as such.</p>



<p>Shota Kobayashi&#8217;s reputation was considerably damaged by this&#8230;</p>



<p>However, for Yuzuru, a calm, cool-headed, and cold-blooded man of Takasegawa, Shota Kobayashi&#8217;s honor was of no importance.</p>



<p>The only thing that mattered was the safety of his lovely sister and the woman he loved.<br> </p>



<p>“Harm them? &#8230;He&#8217;s not the kind of person who would do such a thing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask for your impression. And is it true that you told him a lie?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I never lied to him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You made it sound as if the Takasegawa family was using money and power to threaten and steal Arisa, and that Yuzuru-kun was trying to force her to marry him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because that&#8217;s exactly how it is.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t say anything wrong.</p>



<p>He was just telling the truth, Haruto insisted.</p>



<p>Naoki frowned in response.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;. Apparently, you misunderstood things. Before Arisa&#8217;s marriage, there was talk of business and loans with Takasegawa. Yuzuru-kun and Arisa&#8217;s marriage was for the sake of the friendship between the two families.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you say. In fact, it&#8217;s a given that Arisa is being sacrificed.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Haruto believes that Yuzuru is in love with Arisa or wants her &#8220;body&#8221; and is trying to use the power of his family to plunder her.</p>



<p>That fact is certain in Haruto&#8217;s mind. But even if that fact is not true, even if this marriage is for the sake of the friendship between the two families as Naoki says, the fact remains that Arisa is being used as a human sacrifice.</p>



<p>Naoki&#8217;s eyes widened when he heard Haruto&#8217;s argument.</p>



<p>Arisa is indeed having a hard time&#8230;, but Haruto&#8217;s argument was very different from Naoki&#8217;s perception.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a sacrifice, and I didn&#8217;t mean to make her do it. I was thinking of Arisa&#8217;s happiness as well. The Takasegawa family is one of the most prestigious in this country. If she could marry into that family, her future would be secure. Arisa also wanted a marriage proposal.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>This time, it was Haruto who was taken aback.</p>



<p>If he&#8217;s serious about this, he&#8217;s making a big mistake (from Haruto&#8217;s point of view).<br> </p>



<p>“She wanted a marriage proposal?　There&#8217;s no way Arisa would want that.&#8221;</p>



<p>“How do you know that? Arisa says she wants to marry Yuzuru-kun. I also brought up the idea of an arranged marriage before that because she wanted to do it.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Naoki was struggling to rebuild Amagi, but the future doesn&#8217;t look bright.</p>



<p>Especially before the deal with Takasegawa, Naoki&#8217;s company could have gone bankrupt at any moment.</p>



<p>Considering the future of Arisa, it is never a bad idea to find a good partner early on.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why he proposed the idea to her,</p>



<p><em>&#8216;Why don&#8217;t you try matchmaking?&#8217;</em></p>



<p>There is no reason why she has to get married just because she accepts an arranged marriage.</p>



<p>If she doesn’t like the person, she can refuse.</p>



<p>If she doesn’t find someone she likes, that&#8217;s fine.</p>



<p>If she didn&#8217;t want to do it, that was fine too.<br> </p>



<p>But, Arisa seemed to be on board with the matchmaking.</p>



<p>She showed no particular reluctance to go, and just nodded her head.</p>



<p>And after several matchmaking sessions&#8230;There was no one that Arisa liked, and he was about to stop.<br> </p>



<p>Just then, Takasegawa brought up the fact that Yuzuru was showing interest in Arisa.</p>



<p>Naoki explained this to Haruto.</p>



<p>Then Haruto sighed and&#8230; slapped the table hard.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand anything about Arisa!　You have no idea about your children!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not &#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you asked Arisa if she wanted to have an arranged marriage, how could she say no in her position?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>After shouting this, Haruto got up and went back to his room.</p>



<p>Naoki was stunned for a while&#8230;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;. Hmm, so that&#8217;s how it was.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Then he clutched his head and muttered quietly.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, then I did a bad thing huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
