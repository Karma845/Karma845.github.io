<h3>Chapter 25 – Sweet and Bitter</h3>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>




<p>That day too, Arisa came to Yuzuru&#8217;s house to deliver his lunch.</p>



<p>Yuzuru gratefully accepted the insulated bento box and returned the cleaned bento box.</p>







<p>&#8220;It was delicious again. Thanks again&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m very glad you ate it too, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>It was the same exchange as usual.</p>



<p>Normally this was where Yuzuru and Arisa parted ways.</p>



<p>Arisa would go to school first, and then Yuzuru, after getting ready, would go to school after her.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the usual flow.</p>



<p>However&#8230; today, both of them somehow felt different from usual.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was fidgeting a bit, and Arisa seemed to be fidgeting as well.</p>



<p>The reason was&#8230; obvious.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s because today is Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>







<p>“&#8230;um, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s white skin was faintly tinged with red.</p>



<p>Her voice trembled with nervousness.</p>



<p>Yuzuru also felt his heart pounding.</p>







<p>&#8220;Th-that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-after all, it&#8217;s nothing!&#8221;</p>







<p>She then ran off as if she were running away.</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but open his mouth unintentionally.&nbsp;</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Normally, would anyone mess up at this point?</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru tilted his head, ignoring his own case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, Yuzuru went to school feeling a little bewildered.</p>



<p>When he arrived at the school&#8230; he felt that the atmosphere was still a little different from usual.</p>



<p>There was a definite difference in temperature.</p>



<p>Some of the boys looked happy, some were strangely nervous, some were spreading negative emotions, and some looked no different than usual.</p>



<p>The girls, on the other hand, seemed to be generally cackling.</p>



<p>Girls exchange chocolates with other girls, so they get excited whether they like someone or not.</p>







<p>(<em>I wonder if there are any chocolates in the shoebox?</em>)</p>







<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing to give it directly, so let&#8217;s put it in a shoebox.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible that Arisa would do that.</p>



<p>And when he opened it with such expectations, &#8230;he found only a pair of shoes in it.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ha~a&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzurun~!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gyah!&#8221;</p>







<p>Suddenly, someone slapped Yuzuru on the back, and he screamed.</p>



<p>There are only a few people, if any, who would do something like this.</p>







<p>&#8220;A-Ayaka-chan&#8230; That hurts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry. I hit you too hard.&#8221;</p>







<p>Ayaka grinned and said with an expression that didn&#8217;t seem to reflect much on the situation.</p>



<p>Behind her was another childhood friend.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good morning, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah, good morning. Chiharu-chan&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>It&#8217;s not like the two of them usually come to school together, so they must have just happened to be together.</p>



<p>And she must have attacked Yuzuru with the same tension.</p>



<p>For better or worse, Yuzuru was well aware of the behavioral principles of his childhood friends.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru, did you get it from Arisa?&#8221;</p>







<p>Ayaka said with a grin.</p>



<p>Chiharu followed with a mangled grin as well.</p>







<p>&#8220;We all made it together, Ayaka-san, Arisa-san, and then Tenka-san, you know&#8221;</p>







<p>The two of them knew that Yuzuru had received a lunch box from Arisa earlier that morning.</p>



<p>They probably thought that he received the chocolates at that time.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Yuzuru would think if he were in their shoes.</p>







<p>“No, I didn&#8217;t get any&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa-san&#8230;messed up at the crucial moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka and Chiharu looked at each other in dismay.</p>



<p>However, according to what they said, Arisa had prepared chocolates for him, so that was a relief.</p>







<p>(<em>I&#8217;d be a little shocked if she was going to say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry… I actually forgot! &#8220;&#8230;Or more like that would hinder the plan.</em>)</p>







<p>Yuzuru breathed a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>However, it was not yet confirmed that he would get the chocolate.</p>



<p>It is possible that Arisa will miss the opportunity to give it to him.</p>







<p>“Oh, that&#8217;s right. Here. Yuzurun~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Here you go, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks for this.&#8221;</p>







<p>He received lovely wrapped chocolate from them.</p>



<p>Of course, it was obligatory chocolate.</p>







<p>&#8220;The payback should be triple, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, please include not only the cost of the raw materials but also the effort and our love.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, okay. I&#8217;d prefer to call it&#8230; something appropriate for White Day, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru then scratched his head.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a bit pitiful, so he didn&#8217;t really want to say that, but&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little short on money&#8230; well, I guess I can fill in the missing parts with my feelings, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? I heard that Yuzuru is making a lot of money from your part-time job though?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you buy anything?”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just about to buy it. I&#8217;m thinking of buying something for Arisa.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru said so, Ayaka and Chiharu opened their eyes wide.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah, and don&#8217;t tell Arisa, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of course I won&#8217;t tell her!　Not even if my mouth is torn!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;But that certainly explains the lack of money. Black Thunder is fine for White Day.&#8221; (<strong>TN: </strong><em>It’s a chocolate brand</em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;No, obviously, I&#8217;ll return something a little better.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s conscience will hurt if he returns Black Thunder in return for handmade chocolates, even if it&#8217;s obligatory.</p>



<p>Now, they couldn&#8217;t just stand around talking for too long.</p>



<p>So after ending the conversation, Yuzuru, Ayaka, and Chiharu headed to their respective classrooms.</p>





<p>Just as Yuzuru entered the classroom, the girls were holding a chocolate exchange.</p>



<p>One of them was Arisa.</p>



<p>When he looked at her&#8230;&nbsp; their eyes met.</p>



<p>But it was only for a moment.</p>



<p>Immediately she shyly turned her eyes down.</p>







<p><em>Maybe I won&#8217;t be able to get it&#8230;</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru took his seat, a little depressed.</p>



<p>&#8230;Then he realized.</p>







<p>“Hmm?&#8221;</p>







<p>There was something inside the desk.</p>



<p>It was a box wrapped in pretty packaging.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Instantly.</p>



<p>Yuzuru certainly felt the tension running throughout the class.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230; could it be from Arisa?</em>)</p>







<p><em>&#8216;You did something surprisingly daring&#8230;&#8217;</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru thought, turning his gaze toward Arisa for a moment&#8230;.</p>







<p>(<em>Oh, that’s wrong.</em>)</p>







<p>She was stunned and looked as if it was the end of the world.</p>



<p>She was frozen like a sculpture.</p>



<p>There is no way that the person in question would have such an expression.</p>







<p>(<em>The sender is &#8230;unknown huh</em>)</p>







<p><em>Seriously, what should I do with this&#8230;</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru let out a big sigh.</p>
