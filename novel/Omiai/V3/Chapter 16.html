<h3>Chapter 16 – During The Marathon Event</h3>

<p>At marathons, the girls are supposed to start running first and then the boys a little later.</p>



<p>Why this is done in this order, no one knows&#8230;</p>



<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s to avoid crowding.</p>



<p>In general, if you compare boys and girls, you can assume that the boys are faster.</p>



<p>And although there is a difference in distance, 10km for boys and 7km for girls&#8230; Within this distance, the lead group of boys will soon catch up with the back group of girls.</p>



<p>This is why they delay the start of the boy’s race.</p>






<p>As a result of this, it was time for Yuzuru and the company to run after seeing off Arisa and others.</p>



<p>At the signal, all the boys started running at once.</p>



<p>Yuzuru also started to run alongside Soichiro and the others.</p>







<p><em>(&#8230; At first, there is no difference, or rather, everyone goes along with the others.)</em></p>







<p>Was this because of the unique Japanese tendency to adjust to the group, to look around, and then decide what to do?</p>



<p>Or do boys and girls all over the world adjust to their surroundings?</p>



<p>Or was it because they simply run slowly in the beginning, so they don&#8217;t make a significant gap?</p>



<p>No idea why, but it&#8217;s customary for everyone to start out in a dumpling-like formation and keep in step.</p>







<p>Then, a few people would start to break away from the group&#8230;</p>



<p>The first thing that happened was that the lead group and the back group began to diverge.</p>



<p>The next thing you know, there&#8217;s a big gap between the lead group and the back group.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; (<em>Now what to do?</em>)</p>







<p>The one running in front of Yuzuru was Soichiro.</p>



<p>The one running behind him was Hijiri.</p>



<p>Soichiro doesn&#8217;t intend to let Yuzuru and Hijiri get ahead of him, and Hijiri was probably planning to overtake Yuzuru and Soichiro at the end of the race.</p>



<p>And of course, Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t intend to be overtaken by Hijiri, but rather he intends to overtake Soichiro.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the beginning of the race, so they are keeping a certain distance to see how each other is doing, but from the middle of the race, it will become a psychological battle.</p>







<p>(<em>Well, maybe we should keep this distance for now.</em>)</p>







<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s first priority was to preserve his physical strength.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and the others are relatively in the lead group, which means, they soon began to catch up with the back group of women.</p>



<p>And in the back group,&#8230; Tenka was there.</p>



<p>Even though it was still early in the race, she was already looking distressed.</p>







<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;z~ee~, don&#8217;t, z~ee~, speak to me&#8230;.&#8221;</p>







<p>Such a conversation could be heard from behind.</p>



<p>It seemed that Hijiri had called out to Tenka.</p>



<p>But Tenka didn&#8217;t seem to have much room to answer.</p>



<p>Now, as they passed Tenka and approached the middle section&#8230;</p>







<p>Just on the other side of the lane was the lead group of girls running past the turnaround point.</p>



<p>And among them were&#8230; Ayaka and Chiharu.</p>



<p>The two of them are not the type to hold back or take a wait-and-see attitude in their personalities, so they must have been in the lead from the beginning.</p>



<p>But it seemed that they were having a hard time.</p>



<p>They only made light eye contact with each other and passed on.</p>







<p>And a short time after that&#8230;</p>



<p>He spotted a group of girls among the middle group ahead of him, about to turn the &#8220;girls&#8221; turning point.</p>







<p>(<em>Ah&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>And in it was a uniform number with the surname ‘Yukishiro’ written on it.</p>







<p>Her beautiful flaxen hair, tucked into a bun at the back, swayed.</p>



<p>Circling the triangular cone placed as a landmark, &#8230; Arisa turned in the direction of Yuzuru and the others.</p>



<p>Her white skin was flushed and there was sweat on her skin.</p>



<p>She looked a little harried.</p>







<p>&#8230;. And slightly, her large breasts were swaying.</p>



<p>A pair of healthy white legs are peeking out from the short pants.</p>



<p>The gym uniform was a little sweaty, and the camisole was slightly transparent.</p>







<p>As Yuzuru was giving a hot stare to the slightly sexy Arisa&#8230;</p>



<p>As expected, Arisa also noticed Yuzuru.</p>



<p>And then, as if she misunderstood something, she gave a smile towards Yuzuru.</p>







<p>(<em>Cute&#8230;</em> )</p>







<p>His body suddenly felt full of strength.</p>



<p>But at the same time, he felt a bit bewildered.</p>







<p>(<em>I don&#8217;t want any other man to see this&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>This fairy-like, pretty, and glamorous &#8220;fiancée&#8221; is only for me, and I don&#8217;t want any other man to see her.</p>



<p>Such a desire for exclusivity arose in him.</p>







<p>(<em>No, but&#8230; I also want to show off&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>At the same time, he wanted to show off his fiancée.</p>



<p>Like, <em>&#8216;My &#8220;fiancée&#8221; is cute, isn&#8217;t she? Don&#8217;t you envy me?&#8217;</em></p>







<p>(<em>Oh, this is not good.</em>)</p>







<p>After thinking that much, Yuzuru hurriedly covered his mouth with his hand.</p>



<p>Without realizing it, his facial muscles had loosened up and he was grinning.</p>



<p>A man running with a grin on his face&#8230;</p>



<p>It would be a quite uncomfortable sight, to say the least.</p>







<p>He tightened his expression&#8230; and arrived at the turnaround point for the &#8220;boys&#8221;.</p>



<p>If the start point is the same for both women and men, it is only natural that the turnaround would be different.</p>







<p>Yuzuru went around the triangle cone&#8230;</p>



<p>Then he noticed.</p>



<p>He found Hijiri running beside him.</p>



<p>He was catching up to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Yuzuru sped up so that he didn&#8217;t get overtaken by Hijiri, and also tried to overtake Soichiro.</p>



<p>In response, Soichiro and Hijiri increased their speed.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;ha~&#8221;</p>







<p>The three of them, side by side, began to play a game of cat and mouse.</p>







<p>(<em>&#8230;This was a mistake, wasn&#8217;t it?</em>)</p>







<p>Finally, Yuzuru realized.</p>



<p>If the three of them were to compete, it would only make things harder.</p>



<p>It was easier to just take it easy and run.</p>







<p>However, now the meal is at stake.</p>



<p>In addition, Yuzuru has to give a proper gift to Arisa, so there is no money to spend on buying Soichiro and Hijiri a meal.</p>



<p>Yuzuru runs anyway, thinking about Arisa with all his heart.</p>



<p>However, there will be no concept of physical strength in this world if you can get by only on willpower</p>



<p>Soichiro, Yuzuru, and Hijiri were all reasonably good at exercise, but &#8230;</p>



<p>Among them, Soichiro was the one who stood out.</p>



<p>Inevitably, Soichiro took a slight lead, followed by Yuzuru and Hijiri.</p>







<p>(<em>This is not good&#8230; not good at all.</em>)</p>







<p>Just behind Yuzuru, Hijiri was following closely.</p>



<p>It seemed that he had decided to catch up with him just before the finish line.</p>



<p>He has been slowly putting pressure on Soichiro and Yuzuru.</p>



<p>They didn&#8217;t like it when he pretended to speed up from time to time.</p>







<p>In the meantime, the goal was in sight.</p>



<p>Near the goal, the students who had already arrived were watching from afar.</p>







<p>&#8220;Soichiro-kun, hang in there!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re almost there&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>The voices were of Ayaka and Chiharu.</p>



<p>Then, blatantly, Soichiro&#8217;s speed increased.</p>







<p>To be energized by the cheers of women&#8230;</p>



<p>What a cash cow!　Yuzuru was inwardly indignant.</p>







<p><em>By the way, isn&#8217;t the love of my life cheering me on?</em></p>







<p>Thinking so, he searched for her.</p>



<p>Arisa was right next to Ayaka and Chiharu.</p>



<p>She had her hand on her chest and was looking at him.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s pretty lips moved slightly.</p>







<p><em>Please do your best.</em></p>







<p>That&#8217;s what it seemed like.</p>



<p>Strictly speaking, he felt like Arisa gave her support in such a manner.</p>







<p>(<em>That&#8217;s right. I have to do my best for Arisa.</em>)</p>







<p>Yuzuru put his last bit of energy into it.</p>



<p>Hijiri also made a final push, but&#8230; Yuzuru didn&#8217;t care.</p>







<p><em>Who cares about that guy?</em></p>







<p>All Yuzuru could think of was Arisa.</p>



<p>And&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a wrapped hamburger in a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what it is. As long as it is free.&#8221;</p>







<p>While Soichiro and Yuzuru were talking about which diner to go to,</p>







<p>“&#8230; You guys, in a fight between men, that kind of thing is not fair&#8230; Go die!&#8221;</p>







<p>Hijiri let out a vindictive voice.</p>




<p>Incidentally, Tenka crossed the finish line at the end with a huge round of applause.</p>



<p>Everyone felt sorry for her, so they decided not to mention anything about it.</p>
