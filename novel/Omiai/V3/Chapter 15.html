<h3>Chapter 15 – Hehefu</h3>

	
<p> <br>It was the day of the marathon.</p>






<p>The marathon did not start at the school, but at a track and field stadium a little further away.</p>



<p>From there, the course was to run along the river, around the perimeter, and then back to the track.</p>







<p>Early in the morning, Yuzuru, along with Arisa, Soichiro, Ayaka, and others were laying out leisure sheets on the grass at the outer edge of the stadium and chatting away.　</p>







<p>&#8220;I heard that the girls run first, then the boys.&#8221;</p>







<p>It was Ayaka who said this in a bright voice.</p>



<p>She was good at sports, so the marathon would not be too tough for her.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s supposed to be over in the morning, so it&#8217;s practically half a day today!　Why don&#8217;t we go out and play afterward?&#8221;</p>







<p>Chiharu said in a cheerful voice.</p>



<p>She, too, was not averse to exercise, so she didn&#8217;t seem to find the marathon too distressing.</p>







<p>&#8220;You can play all you want, but not me&#8230; Let me rest.&#8221;</p>







<p>Soichiro said with a sigh.</p>



<p>He was sandwiched between Ayaka and Chiharu, and they were pestering him to play with them.</p>



<p>Some of the boys were giving Soichiro a vindictive look.</p>







<p>But Yuzuru, a childhood friend, knew that it took a lot of energy and stamina to play with Ayaka and Chiharu, who were both very excited.</p>



<p>So he did not feel so envious.</p>



<p>In fact, he felt sorry for him.</p>



<p>That being said, it does reaffirm that this two-timing guy is a scumbag.</p>







<p>&#8220;Seven kilometers is not an insignificant distance and you should rest your body, don&#8217;t you think? &#8230;I suppose that&#8217;s the intention behind not having classes in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said with a wry smile.</p>



<p>Then Soichiro reproached both Ayaka and Chiharu, &#8220;Look, Yukishiro-san says so too&#8221;.</p>







<p>&#8221; Speaking of resting, Arisa. &#8230;Is your body okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru asked Arisa.</p>



<p>It has already been more than a week since her cold was completely cured.</p>



<p>So, her physical condition should not be bad at all.</p>



<p>However, whether or not she was in condition to run long distances was a different story.</p>



<p>Her physical strength must be a little low.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yes, I feel fine. &#8230; Thanks to Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa blushed slightly and said.</p>



<p>Yuzuru remembered the time when he nursed her.</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s white bareback &#8230;was very glossy.</p>







<p>&#8220;I, I see &#8230;I&#8217;m glad to hear that.&#8221;</p>







<p>A little bit of awkwardness flowed between Yuzuru and Arisa.</p>



<p><em>&#8216;Oh, something must have happened&#8217;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The others gave them warm glances thinking that.</p>







<p>&#8220;Mo, more than me&#8230;Tenka-san&#8230; Will you be okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa diverted the topic by sacrificing Tenka.</p>



<p>And the complexion of Tenka, who was made the scapegoat &#8230;was not very good.</p>







<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Physically, well, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>







<p>Tenka answered Hijiri&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>Then she sighed.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a terrible mood&#8230; I have a favor to ask you all if that&#8217;s okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru and the others nodded, Tenka said.</p>







<p>&#8220;Please&#8230; don&#8217;t cheer for me. I don&#8217;t want you to welcome me or applaud me at the finishing line.&#8221;</p>







<p>Speaking of which, there was a culture of applauding the last-place finisher, Yuzuru remembered.</p>



<p><em>What was the reason for that? </em>Yuzuru wondered as he tilted his head.</p>







<p>For a person who was the last one to finish, it would make them stand out even more, so it would be a humiliation.</p>



<p>Although Yuzuru had never been a victim, he could somehow imagine what it must be like.</p>



<p>Since Yuzuru can imagine it, other ordinary people can also imagine it.</p>



<p>However, of course, some people dare to clap to humiliate&#8230; but not all of them.</p>







<p><em>(&#8230;Well, maybe the reason people cheer for the last person is that otherwise, it would seem like they are being kind of heartless.)</em></p>







<p>It&#8217;s a little awkward to greet the last person in line without saying a word because you feel sorry for them.</p>



<p>Therefore, they might clap their hands in comfort.</p>



<p>Aside from the person being greeted, it makes the person greeting the other person feel better.</p>







<p>&#8220;Shall I cheer you up over the loudspeaker?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really mind, but I&#8217;ll curse you, okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>Tenka glared at Hijiri, who was making fun of her.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s the heiress of a religious organization, so her curse could really work.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8216;By the way, Yuzuru. Do you remember your promise properly?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you forgot?&#8221;</p>







<p>When he was asked by Soichiro and Hijiri&#8230; Yuzuru tilted his head.</p>



<p>He remembered that he had promised to give a massage with Arisa afterward, but he did not remember promising to give a massage with Soichiro and Hijiri, which would be very unpleasant.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; about the meal&#8221;</p>







<p>But then Yuzuru immediately remembered.</p>



<p>The person who came in last in the marathon among them was supposed to buy the two winners a meal.</p>







<p>&#8220;Of course I remember. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru was also confident in his physical strength.</p>



<p>As long as he was going to compete, he had no intention of losing.</p>



<p>He also wanted to win the game and spend time with Arisa in a comfortable and refreshed mood.</p>



<p>So he will definitely win.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ho~&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now you said it&#8221;</p>







<p>However, it seems that Soichiro and Hijiri also have no intention of losing.</p>



<p>Tenka sighed slightly exaggeratedly as the three of them exchanged sparks with eyes&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Great, sounds like a lot of fun&#8230; I wonder if there&#8217;s some kind of trick to make it easier for me?&#8221;</p>







<p>Chiharu replied to Tenka&#8217;s musings.</p>







<p>&#8220;I do breathing like &#8216;hehefu&#8217;, you know. It kind of makes me feel better.&#8221; (<strong>TN:</strong> <em>hehefu is part of the Lamaze breathing technique used during childbirth. You can google it</em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s for childbirth, isn&#8217;t it? Does it have any effect?&#8221;</p>







<p>Whether the Lamaze method is useful for endurance running is a bit of a question.</p>



<p>Chiharu cowered at Arisa&#8217;s doubts.</p>







<p>&#8220;Who knows? But if it makes childbirth easier, wouldn&#8217;t it be enough for an endurance run?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Chiharu-san&#8230; I will believe you, okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>Tenka wanted to believe the unreliable words of Chiharu.</p>



<p>Though Yuzuru thought she better not &#8230;Chiharu confidently flexed her large breasts and then stuck out her thumb.</p>







<p>&#8220;Please feel comfortable as you are in a big boat. I&#8217;m a human deity, you know?&#8221; (<strong>TN: </strong><em>I had given an explanation for that idiom before.</em>)</p>



<p>&#8220;Like saying God, Buddha, and Chiharu-sama, right.&#8221;</p>







<p>Ayaka chuckled and said.　</p>



<p>At least Ayaka had no intention of believing what the &#8216;God Chiharu&#8217; was saying.</p>







<p>And while that was going on, the signal to assemble was given.</p>



<p>Each class would gather and do preparatory exercises as a whole, and then &#8230;&#8230; the exercise would begin, dividing into men and women.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa walked up to their classmates, side by side.　　</p>



<p>&#8230; It wasn&#8217;t unnatural for Yuzuru and Arisa, who had been with Ayaka and the others earlier, to walk together to their classmates.</p>



<p>Of course, those around them could see that their relationship was growing&#8230;</p>



<p>This was an important &#8220;preparation&#8221; for both of them.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You remember what comes after, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>







<p>After this,</p>



<p>That is after the marathon was over.</p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded vigorously.</p>







<p>&#8220;Of course&#8230; So let&#8217;s both do our best&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>They both smiled in unison.</p>
