<h3>Chapter 3 “Fiancée” and New Year Greetings</h3>

<p><br>New Year&#8217;s was not a very relaxing time for Yuzuru and the Takasegawa family.<br></p>



<p>This was because many relatives and people who do business with the Takasegawa family come to greet them.</p>



<p>Of course, there were parties and New Year&#8217;s gifts, so it&#8217;s not all bad.</p>



<p>And&#8230;naturally.</p>



<p>People who may become my family in the future also visit the Takasegawa family.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Happy New Year. Takasegawa-san. I look forward to working with you again this year.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my pleasure, Amagi-san. Congratulations on the new year. I look forward to working with you again this year as well.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kazuya Takasegawa.</p>



<p>Yuzuru Takasegawa.</p>



<p>Naoki Amagi.</p>



<p>Arisa Yukishiro.<br></p>



<p>Each of them faced each other, sat on the floor, and exchanged greetings.</p>



<p>The atmosphere of the old-fashioned Takasegawa residence helped to create a very solemn atmosphere.</p>



<p>Nevertheless&#8230;</p>



<p>The formal exchange and atmosphere soon ended.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; Arisa-san. Consider this as a sentiment.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Kazuya, with a gentle smile, handed the New Year&#8217;s gift bag to Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa bowed her head deeply.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>After Arisa received her New Year&#8217;s gift, Naoki took out a New Year&#8217;s gift bag from his bag.</p>



<p>He then presented it to Yuzuru.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Yuzuru-kun. From me as well &#8230; here&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru also received the New Year&#8217;s gift.</p>



<p>Then Kazuya and Naoki looked at each other lightly.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; Yuzuru. Show Arisa-san around.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa, please do not be rude.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Both of them nodded in agreement as their fathers ordered them to do so.<br></p>



<p>"Yes."</p>





<p>Now, when he left the room and closed the sliding door, Yuzuru sighed loudly&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha~a&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Arisa asked Yuzuru, with a worried expression on her face.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;You look tired &#8230;Are a lot of people still coming for&nbsp; greeting?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, pretty much.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded while holding his head.</p>



<p>&#8230; Actually, yesterday there was a party among the relatives of the Takasegawa family and he got carried away and drank too much alcohol.</p>



<p>This was why he had a slight hangover.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s about half of the reason why Yuzuru was tired.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; let&#8217;s just head over there to collect your New Year&#8217;s gifts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;ahaha&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa chuckled.</p>



<p>Collecting the New Year&#8217;s gift, which means going to greet Yuzuru&#8217;s family (other than Kazuya).<br></p>



<p>&#8220;So, after that, I was wondering if you would like to go for a walk&#8230;?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru wanted to get some cool air outside.</p>



<p>And&#8230;, he wanted to take a walk around the neighborhood with Arisa.</p>



<p>During the summer festival, it was crowded with people, so it was hard to say that he was able to calmly show her around the neighborhood.<br></p>



<p>Besides&#8230;<br></p>



<p>(<em>This would be my first date with Arisa &#8230;since I became clearly aware that I liked her.</em>)<br></p>



<p>Not long ago, suggesting a date would have been a no-brainer.</p>



<p>Now, just suggesting a walk was enough to make his heart pound.<br></p>



<p>“Okay. It&#8217;s fine.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Arisa gave a small smile.</p>



<p>It was a very beautiful expression.<br><br></p>



<p>After collecting Arisa&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s gifts, the two of them walked out of the mansion.</p>



<p>Arisa narrowed her eyes and murmured sincerely.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Your garden is beautiful, isn&#8217;t it, Yuzuru-san? In winter, the atmosphere will be different again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh well&#8230;&#8221;<br></p>



<p>The maintenance of the garden is very important.</p>



<p>That garden is a tool to show off the power of the Takasegawa family and to intimidate the people who visit the house.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why it costs a good amount of money.</p>



<p>It is only natural that it is beautiful.<br></p>



<p>But&#8230;<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I think you&#8217;re more beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W, wait, what are you talking about?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>When Yuzuru muttered this, Arisa&#8217;s white skin turned rosy.</p>



<p>Then she glared lightly at Yuzuru.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;W, we&#8217;re talking about your garden, aren&#8217;t we? My appearance &#8230;has nothing to do with it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N, no &#8230;sorry. That was a bit out of context. But&#8230; it&#8217;s true that I thought you were beautiful&#8230; The kimono looks good on you.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Beautiful flaxen hair.</p>



<p>Jade-colored eyes.</p>



<p>Long eyelashes and wide-round eyes.</p>



<p>Her nose is straight and her lips are plump and glossy.　</p>



<p>Her skin is as white as white porcelain, smooth and soft as marshmallows.</p>



<p>She was wearing a crimson kimono with a lucky charm pattern.</p>



<p>Her beautiful hair was tied up and held in place with a hairpin.<br></p>



<p>She was truly beautiful.</p>



<p>From the bottom of his heart, Yuzuru wished he could have her for himself.<br></p>



<p>Arisa lowered her eyes in embarrassment.</p>



<p>Then she nodded her head, her cheeks blushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much&#8230; This kimono was a memento of my mother. I&#8217;m very happy that Yuzuru-san praised it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. That explains why it looks so good on you.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>He felt that when he became officially engaged to Arisa, he should greet her blood-related parents.</p>



<p>Slowly, Yuzuru extended his hand to Arisa.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yuzuru-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s&#8230; hard to walk in those slippers, isn&#8217;t it?　I thought I&#8217;d hold your hand to help.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s heart started to race.</p>



<p>His face naturally became hot.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Arisa&#8217;s face was also red up to her ears, as if she had been taken in by Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Then, slowly she reached out her hand.<br></p>



<p>“Then&#8230; please.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; leave it to me.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru took Arisa&#8217;s white hand.</p>



<p>The hand was very soft and warm.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>Determined not to let go, Yuzuru intertwined his fingers with Arisa&#8217;s and regripped them.</p>



<p>It was a form called a lover&#8217;s connection.<br><em><br>(<strong>TN: </strong>Lover’s connection/Koibito Tsunagi &#8211; Intertwining fingers with palms facing each other. It’s a more intimate form of holding hands.)</em></p>



<p>Then he closed the distance between them so that their shoulders were touching.<br></p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, um&#8230; Yuzuru-san?&#8221;<br></p>



<p>She looked up at Yuzuru, who was standing right next to her, with a confused look in her eyes.</p>



<p>With a casual expression and tone of voice, Yuzuru replied to her.<br></p>



<p>“What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;<br></p>



<p>Arisa turned her face downcast in embarrassment.<br></p>



<p>Yuzuru wanted to put the hands they held in a pocket, but&#8230;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, both parties were wearing kimonos and there were no pockets, so he gave up.</p>
