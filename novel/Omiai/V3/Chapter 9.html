<h3>Chapter 9 – “Fiancée’s” Sleep-talking</h3>

<p>Yuzuru said this as he struggled to hold back the blood flowing to his lower half.</p>



<p>If Yuzuru and Arisa were lovers in name and reality, it would be fine to do such a thing.</p>



<p>But even though they are nominally fiancées, in reality, they are just friends.</p>



<p>Of course, in the future, he plans (in Yuzuru&#8217;s mind) to become her fiancé in both name and reality, but not now.</p>



<p>As expected, he tried to refuse&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; dirty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? No&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry&#8230; My sweat is dirty, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Said Arisa in a sad voice.</p>




<p>She looked at Yuzuru with a sad and depressed expression.<br></p>




<p>&#8220;No, nothing like that&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but say that.</p>




<p>Then Arisa said in a bouncy voice, though she looked embarrassed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then&#8230;Will you do it for me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Fine, got it.&#8221;</p>





<p>Yuzuru turned to face Arisa&#8217;s back, feeling like he was drunk.</p>





<p>The back was wet with sweat&#8230;&nbsp; but it was really smooth and beautiful.</p>



<p>In fact, the moisture made it look even shinier.</p>



<p>Whether it was from the heat or embarrassment, the white back was slightly flushed.</p>



<p>Yuzuru unfolded the wet towel and slowly brought it closer.</p>



<p>His heart raced with tension, and his hands trembled.</p>





<p>&#8220;Hi~yah!&#8221;</p>






<p>Then Arisa raised a lustful voice.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s heart jumped loudly.</p>




<p>&#8220;H, hey!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, sorry&#8230; Y, you startled me&#8230;&#8221;</p>





<p>Yuzuru was the one who was surprised.</p>



<p>Anyone would be surprised and &#8230; excited if the person they love suddenly raises their sexy voice, half-naked.</p>






<p>&#8220;No, I should have said something before I did it&#8230; I&#8217;ll wipe it off now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; mmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>





<p>Once again, Yuzuru started wiping Arisa&#8217;s back with a wet towel.</p>



<p>He proceeded to wipe away the sticky sweat.</p>



<p>And every time the towel was moved&#8230; Arisa made a small enchanting sound.</p>





<p>&#8220;Ah~.., Mm~&#8230;Ahn~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Is it tickling you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ye, yes&#8230;Mm&#8230;Excuse me&#8230;&#8221;</p>





<p>Arisa turned around slightly, hiding her front with her hands and clothes, and nodded to Yuzuru as she said this.</p>



<p>The white collarbone, the beautiful armpit, and the white bulge that extended from her armpit to the front of her body became visible.</p>



<p>The blood flowing through his body quickened.</p>





<p>At the same time that Arisa turned her back again, Yuzuru resumed his work, but&#8230;</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but be curious about Arisa&#8217;s front.</p>



<p>Although he thought it was not good to do so&#8230;</p>




<p><em>(Isn&#8217;t it Arisa&#8217;s fault being so defenseless in the first place?)</em></p>





<p>And with that excuse, he closed the distance a bit.</p>



<p>Then, he leaned forward and gently peeked forward over her shoulder.</p>



<p><em>Gokuri~</em>&#8230; Yuzuru gulped.</p>





<p>First, the beautiful collarbone was visible.</p>



<p>Then, from the collarbone down, there was a soft curve.</p>



<p>At the centerline of the curve, there was a cleavage that made him want to trace it with his hand, and he could see the sweat pooling there.</p>



<p>Her breasts were hidden by her nightgown, which she held down with both hands so that the soft mass of fat was slightly crushed.</p>



<p>However, they were still large enough that he could clearly see the bulge.</p>



<p>The top and sides of the breasts, which are not fully hidden, were clearly visible.</p>



<p>But&#8230; the most important part, the apex of curves were not visible.</p>





<p>If only Arisa had shifted her hand a little, he could have seen it&#8230;</p>



<p>Yuzuru was struck with a very frustrating feeling.</p>





<p>&#8220;Ah, um&#8230; Yuzuru-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?　What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>




<p>When Arisa called out to him, Yuzuru came back to himself.</p>



<p>His heart thumped loudly.</p>






<p>Arisa stared up at Yuzuru with moist eyes.</p>



<p>The distance between their faces was&#8230; very close.</p>



<p>He could feel the hot breath of Arisa on his face.</p>





<p>&#8220;If you stare at me like that&#8230; it&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N, no&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>





<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but look away.</p>



<p>It seemed that he had been caught trying to glance at Arisa&#8217;s breasts.</p>





<p>After that, Yuzuru only concentrated on wiping Arisa&#8217;s back, and&#8230;</p>



<p>He managed to finish the task.</p>





<p>He then left the room and waited until Arisa had wiped her front herself and finished dressing.</p>



<p>After a while, she permitted him to enter the room, so he did.</p>




<p>“I apologize for the inconvenience.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N, no&#8230; don&#8217;t worry about it. I&#8217;m&#8230; sorry, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N, no&#8230; it is fine. I mean, it&#8217;s more like&#8230;&#8221;</p>





<p>Arisa stammered after saying that.</p>



<p>If anything, Yuzuru was curious as to what it was, but he didn&#8217;t ask.</p>





<p>Nevertheless, this was the end of the nursing care Yuzuru could provide.</p>



<p>It was late at night, so Yuzuru decided to say his farewell to Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;ll take my leave&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p><em>I&#8217;ll be going home.</em></p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Yuzuru was about to convey.</p>




<p>&#8220;Um, could you please &#8230;stay overnight today?　I&#8217;m a little nervous&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S, stay here&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No&#8230; Not that I want you to sleep with me&#8230; I just want you to be close to me&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Is it no good?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Arisa asked Yuzuru with an upturned glance.</p>





<p>Of course, there was no way he could say no.</p>




<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll ask your father&#8217;s permission to stay&#8230; If he says it&#8217;s okay&#8230; I&#8217;ll bring a sleeping bag from my house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand.&#8221;</p>




<p>Not knowing what to explain, Yuzuru asked Naoki Amagi to let him stay over as Arisa&#8217;s condition was not good and she wanted him to stay.</p>



<p>Naoki seemed a little confused, but&#8230; gave him permission, saying, &#8220;Take care of my daughter&#8221;.</p>





<p>Yuzuru rushed to his apartment and brought a sleeping bag.</p>





<p>&#8220;Truly&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry for the inconvenience.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. At least when you have a cold, you can indulge yourself as much as you like.&#8221;</p>





<p>Yuzuru replied to Arisa, who bowed her head.</p>



<p>Then Arisa, as to indulge as per Yuzuru&#8217;s words&#8230;</p>





<p>&#8220;Um, I am not able to sleep&#8230; So can you hold my hand&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, got it.&#8221;</p>





<p>Yuzuru held onto Arisa&#8217;s hand as he had done during the day.</p>



<p>He watched Arisa&#8217;s sleeping face as she rested her eyes in relief.</p>




<p>After a while, she began to make lovely sleeping sounds.</p>



<p><em>(&#8230; Nevertheless, she&#8217;s really beautiful)</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru stared at Arisa&#8217;s face&#8230; and her glossy lips.</p>



<p><em>Would it wake her up if I pressed my lips to hers?</em>　He wondered.</p>



<p><em>(N, no&#8230; That&#8217;s not good. I shouldn&#8217;t do anything that betrays her trust.)</em></p>





<p>Yuzuru desperately suppressed his instincts with the reins of reason.</p>



<p>And just as when he turned on his heel and was about to leave Arisa&#8217;s room&#8230;</p>





<p>&#8221; Yuzuru-san&#8230;I like you&#8230;&#8221;</p>





<p>His heart jumped loudly.</p>



<p>Yuzuru slowly turned his head back.</p>





<p>Arisa&#8230; was still asleep.</p>





<p>&#8220;&#8230; talking in your sleep, huh&#8221;</p>





<p>Yuzuru sighed, relieved.</p>



<p>Yuzuru opened the door so as not to wake Arisa&#8230;</p>



<p>Then, as he left, he muttered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I like you too, Arisa. Good night.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said this in a small voice and then closed the door.</p>



<p>And then&#8230;</p>




<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san no&#8230;baka&#8230; You just made it impossible for me to sleep, you know&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p><em>(</em><strong><em>TN: “</em></strong><em>Yuzuru san no baka” means “Yuzuru-san, you idiot”. But it was cuter as it is.)</em><br> </p>





<p>Arisa buried her face in the pillow and muttered to herself.</p>

<p><em>For the time being, they both understood that they like each other..</em></p>
