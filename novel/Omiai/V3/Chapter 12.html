<h3>Chapter 12 – Takasegawa and Uenishi</h3>


<p>When he heard those words from Chiharu.</p>



<p><em>I see~,</em> Yuzuru thought to himself.</p>




<p>Ayaka, Chiharu and Tenka are friends of Arisa.</p>



<p>The word &#8220;friend&#8221; here includes not only the essence but also the perception of the people around them.</p>



<p>Since the study session, the four of them have been eating lunch and chatting together (although not very often since they are in different classes).</p>



<p>The people around them have witnessed this.</p>



<p>So it&#8217;s not unusual for Ayaka and Chiharu to invite Arisa out to meals.</p>



<p>Also&#8230; it is not uncommon for Ayaka and Chiharu to invite Yuzuru to lunch either.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a well-known fact that Yuzuru, Ayaka, and Chiharu are close friends.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa do not have any contact with each other in terms of school relationships.</p>



<p>But through Ayaka and the others, they have a strong connection.</p>



<p>Using Ayaka as an intermediary, they became close friends and were attracted to each other.</p>



<p>It will be a natural storyline.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Ah, sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, Yuzuru said to Ayaka as he emerged from the sea of thoughts.</p>



<p>Then he turned his gaze behind himself, to Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8221; What about you, Yukishiro-san?&#8221;</p>





<p>It was a nostalgic way of calling her.</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked Arisa while immersed in a bit of nostalgia.</p>







<p>On the other hand, when Yuzuru called out to her, Arisa at first looked stunned&#8230;</p>



<p>But soon after, she came back to herself and smiled.</p>







<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind either. Takasegawa-san&#8221;</p>







<p>The sound of it was a little nostalgic.</p>


<p>The place chosen for lunch was the cafeteria.</p>







<p>The group consisted of Ayaka and Chiharu, Yuzuru and Arisa, and Soichiro, Hijiri and Tenka.</p>



<p>More importantly&#8230;</p>






<p>&#8220;&#8230;This is the first time that the seven of us have gathered at school, right?&#8221;</p>







<p>It was Hijiri who spilled it out.</p>







<p>“Yes, I suppose so. I wonder if we&#8217;ve finally become friends in the official sense of the word.&#8221;</p>







<p>The one who made such a meaningful remark was Tenka.</p>



<p>The one who sensitively picked up on Tenka&#8217;s words was Hijiri.</p>






<p>&#8220;You black-hearted woman&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara. Excuse you&#8230; It is natural to want to get to know Ayaka-san, Takasegawa-kun, and Satake-kun, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>







<p>She stated that without hesitation.</p>



<p>It was like a public declaration that the reason behind the contact between Tenka, Yuzuru, Ayaka, and Soichiro was because of their family background.</p>



<p>&#8230;Most importantly, the three of them were not shocked by this.</p>



<p>They knew from the start what Tenka&#8217;s intentions were.</p>



<p>It is natural for the Nagiri family to want to connect with Takasegawa and Tachibana, even if they do not receive their support&#8230;</p>



<p>And it was possible that Nagiri would try to approach at some point, and when they did, it was something within expectation.</p>



<p>Therefore, what is important for both Yuzuru and Ayaka is the fact that Tenka had openly stated this fact.</p>



<p>That means that&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in your care going forward, everyone.&#8221;</p>







<p>She smiled mischievously.</p>



<p>Then she stuck her tongue out slightly.</p>



<p>A little devil.</p>



<p>Such words passed through Yuzuru&#8217;s mind.</p>







<p><em>We have become such good friends that I can proudly confess that I contacted you all because of your family background.</em></p>



<p><em>I hope you will continue to be my friends and business partners.</em></p>







<p>Or so Yuzuru read Tenka&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>Unintentionally, Yuzuru chuckled.</p>



<img src="https://i.ibb.co/g3rptDt/u4754-9536c377-18b1-41f7-9e2a-6b47550ce57d.jpg" height= "560" width= "400"></img>



<p>It&#8217;s a good way to say something without giving the other person a bad impression.</p>



<p>She is indeed the daughter of Nagiri, the heiress of a religious family.</p>



<p>She is very good at talking.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>And so far, it was not so surprising to Yuzuru&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;By all means, let me return the favor when I get the chance, okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>With that wink, Yuzuru felt his heart leap as he was smiled at.</p>



<p>Tenka&#8217;s gaze lingered on Yuzuru and Arisa&#8217;s lunch boxes</p>



<p>Yes&#8230; the contents of their lunch boxes were exactly the same.</p>







<p>Of course, it was already a known fact to the members of the group that Yuzuru was having his lunch made by Arisa.</p>



<p>So in addition to the earlier glance, the intention of deliberately looking at Yuzuru and Arisa&#8217;s lunch box was that&#8230;</p>





<p>He can ask her for love advice.</p>



<p>And she&#8217;s rooting for them.</p>







<p>That&#8217;s how he perceived it.</p>







<p>(<em>Ah,&#8230;You&#8217;re working with Hijiri, huh</em>)</p>







<p>And at this point, Yuzuru realized that the flow of the conversation up to this point was a deliberate one created by Tenka and Hijiri.</p>







<p>&#8230; Although he was happy to have the support, he felt a little ridicule.</p>



<p>No, it definitely contained the intention of ridicule.</p>



<p>Since she continued to do so, there was no way that neither the Takasegawa family nor Yuzuru himself would back down.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I&#8217;ll definitely be counting on you&#8230; And you can count on me, Nagiri-san. Nagiri, as an ally of Ryozenji, is synonymous with being an ally of Takasegawa.&#8221;</p>







<p>At first glance, the words seem almost casual and generic, emphasizing the connection between the houses.</p>



<p>However, based on the close relationship between&#8230; Hijiri and Tenka, those words take a turn and become something that makes fun of their relationship.</p>



<p>And it seemed that Yuzuru&#8217;s intentions were firmly conveyed to Hijiri and Tenka.</p>



<p>Both of them had subtle expressions on their faces.</p>







<p>“When did Ryozenji-san and Tenka-san first become acquainted?&#8221;</p>







<p>And then, as if in pursuit, Arisa asked them that.</p>



<p>Arisa is by no means an idiot&#8230; but rather a smart girl.</p>



<p>Although she was not trained in the kind of &#8220;tongue fighting&#8221; that Yuzuru, Ayaka, and Tenka were, she was aware that she was being ridiculed and could fight back.</p>







<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230;&#8230; Well, since middle school, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. &#8230;&#8230; Originally, there was a relationship between the houses, but the ties became stronger a few years ago.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>I am not asking about the houses, I am asking about your relationship.</em></p>



<p>And when Yuzuru and Arisa were about to follow up.</p>



<p>Hijiri blatantly diverted the topic.</p>







<p>&#8220;It is parallel to the improved relationship between Takasegawa and Uenishi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Takasegawa and Ryozenji, and Uenishi and Nagiri have a deep relationship with each other&#8230; First, the relationship between Takasegawa and Uenishi improved, and then Ryozenji and Nagiri approached each other.&#8221;</p>







<p>The relationship between Takasegawa and Ryozenji began in the postwar period.</p>



<p>Ryozenji was founded when Takasegawa gave political and financial support to a man who was Hijiri&#8217;s great-grandfather.</p>



<p>At that time, Ryozenji was like a subordinate organization of Takasegawa.</p>







<p>Now Ryozenji is already &#8220;independent&#8221; from Takasegawa, but still, Ryozenji has not forgotten its debt to Takasegawa. Also, Takasegawa has always been a valued customer of Ryozenji.</p>



<p>Takasegawa is huge, for better or worse, so having a &#8220;do-it-all&#8221; guy like Ryozenji comes in handy in many ways.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the relationship between Uenishi and Nagiri was much simpler.</p>



<p>Uenishi is the so-called &#8220;boss&#8221; of the Kinki region.</p>



<p>In addition, since they are both religious people, it would be natural for Nagiri to ask Uenishi for help in many ways.</p>



<p>Therefore, as long as the relationship between Takasegawa and Uenishi is bad, Ryozenji and Nagiri will be careful about the two families.</p>



<p>In other words, if the relationship between the two families improves, Ryozenji and Nagiri will be able to get closer to each other.</p>







<p>(<em>Well, actually, it&#8217;s probably the other way around.</em>)</p>



<p>If Yuzuru&#8217;s memory is correct, Ryozenji and Nagiri got close a little earlier, before Yuzuru was born.</p>



<p>It is more appropriate to consider the order of events as follows: Ryozenji and Nagiri approached each other, and then Takasegawa and Uenishi closed the distance between them.</p>



<p>&#8230;Just as Ayaka and Chiharu were the ostensible bridge between Yuzuru and Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; improved? Didn&#8217;t Yuzuru-san&#8217;s family and Chiharu-san&#8217;s family get along very well?&#8221;</p>







<p>Then Arisa tilted her head.</p>



<p>That reminded Yuzuru that he had never told Arisa about the relationship between Takasegawa and Uenishi.</p>







<p>&#8220;Hmm, you didn&#8217;t know? &#8230; I thought Uenishi and Takasegawa were famous for their bad relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not familiar with such things&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa shrugged in response to Soichiro&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>Unlike Yuzuru, who is the next head of the family and has received education in this area, Arisa seemed to lack knowledge in it.</p>



<p>Apparently, Naoki Amagi had not taught her anything about it.　</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also possible that he himself is not familiar with it.</p>







<p>&#8220;So, is it similar to the relationship between Yuzuru-san&#8217;s house and Ayaka-san&#8217;s house&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, it&#8217;s true that Tachibana and Takasegawa don&#8217;t get along well&#8230; But they&#8217;re relatives at the same time, so it&#8217;s kind of a process&#8230; It&#8217;s not as bad as the relationship between Takasegawa and Uenishi a long time ago.&#8221;</p>







<p>Ayaka replied to Arisa&#8217;s question.</p>



<p>And there, both Hijiri and Tenka leaned forward.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that the relationship between Takasegawa and Uenishi was at its worst, but I don&#8217;t know much about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re talking about it, I&#8217;d love to hear more about it.&#8221;</p>







<p>There was no lie in the words of Hijiri and Tenka.</p>



<p>But if anything, it was probably more out of concern for Arisa than out of curiosity.</p>



<p>And naturally, it was also to encourage Yuzuru and Chiharu to explain to Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain it to you briefly. There was a dispute during the Meiji Restoration. It was a dispute over land acquisition and old interests.&#8221;</p>



<p>“On the political side, there was the abolition of Buddhism, state Shintoism, and so on&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Our shrine is also engaged in Shinto-Buddhist syncretism, and our religious affiliation is different from that of Ise Shrine. We didn&#8217;t like it when people impose such things on us.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Takasegawa was originally a member of the Shogunate faction and was the spearhead of the new government. In contrast,&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We were more neutral than the Shogunate. I think that&#8217;s why we were spotted.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we had skirmishes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So we have been in a sort of secluded state since then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, relations have improved considerably now, so there&#8217;s no need to worry about it.&#8221;</p>







<p>And that&#8217;s how it was explained to Arisa.</p>



<p>In fact, the relationship between the two has improved to the point where a marriage proposal has been discussed between Yuzuru and Chiharu,&#8230;&#8230;, but Yuzuru did not mention this because it would cause unnecessary misunderstanding and misinterpretation from Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; What&#8217;s it like to have a different faith affiliation?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s interest seemed to have shifted towards Chiharu&#8217;s shrine.</p>



<p>Maybe she decided that &#8220;Takasegawa and Uenishi getting along badly&#8221; was not a good topic to talk about, or maybe she was genuinely intrigued.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was both.</p>







<p>&#8220;Our shrine is quite old. According to tradition, it&#8217;s been around for more than two thousand years&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked about her house, Chiharu answered in a good mood.</p>



<p>Chiharu&#8217;s house is older than any of the members in this group.</p>



<p>&#8230; but that&#8217;s just folklore and shouldn&#8217;t be taken seriously.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s only about a thousand years old for certain. However, it is still by far the oldest.</p>







<p>&#8220;Wow&#8230; that&#8217;s impressive.!　Is there anything unique about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see. I think the best feature is&#8230; matrilineal inheritance. We often have researchers come to visit us. They say it&#8217;s quite valuable because it shows the vestiges of the matriarchal society that Japan used to have a long time ago.&#8221;</p>







<p>Matrilineal inheritance.</p>



<p>This means that property and rituals are passed down from mother to daughter.</p>



<p>Therefore, this means that the sons and daughters of Chiharu&#8217;s son&#8230; will not be given the right to inherit the Uenishi family name.</p>







<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s interesting&#8230; Does that mean that Chiharu-san will one day have a prospective groom to marry into the house&#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>For a moment, Arisa turned her gaze to Soichiro.</p>



<p>Chiharu, on the other hand, shook her head from side to side.</p>







<p>&#8220;No, I will not take a son-in-law. As long as I inherit the governorship of Uenishi, I cannot get married. Fufu, it means that I will dedicate myself to the gods.&#8221;</p>







<p>Somewhat confidently, Chiharu said and placed her hand on her chest.</p>



<p>Her words were very proud, and there was not a trace of anxiety or dissatisfaction about the future.</p>







<p>Arisa, on the other hand, looks a little confused.</p>



<p>&#8216;Not being able to get married&nbsp; ‘ didn&#8217;t sound like a good thing to her, and also she couldn&#8217;t understand how they can have a &#8216;matrilineal inheritance&#8217; without getting married in the first place.</p>







<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; then, um, what will you be doing?&#8230; You know about children, or rather, successors. Are you going to adopt a child?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way. I&#8217;ll give birth to one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa tilted her head, puzzled.</p>



<p>Chiharu, on the other hand, had a wicked grin on her face.</p>



<p>She then looked over at Yuzuru.</p>



<p><em>&#8216;Don&#8217;t give away any spoilers&#8217;,</em>&nbsp; she implied.</p>







<p>Yuzuru, Soichiro, Ayaka, and Tenka knew the story.</p>



<p>Hijiri, on the other hand, was leaning forward slightly and doesn&#8217;t seem to know much about Uenishi&#8217;s faith.</p>






<p>&#8220;But &#8230;you can&#8217;t get married, right?　Um, well, then with whom will you have children?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Arisa asked her question, Chiharu answered as if she had been waiting for her.</p>




<p>&#8221; Well, of course. With father.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;!?!?!?!?&#8221;</p>




<p>Arisa&#8217;s eyes became like dots.</p>



<p>In addition, Hijiri dropped his chopsticks.</p>
