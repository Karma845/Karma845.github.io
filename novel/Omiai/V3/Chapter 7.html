<h3>Chapter 7 – “Fiancée’s” Request</h3>

<p><br>Before I went to Arisa&#8217;s house, there was something I had to do first.</p>



<p>Yuzuru called Naoki Amagi on his cell phone.<br> </p>



<p>He apologized for calling him while he was working.</p>



<p>He also told him that Arisa had caught a cold.</p>



<p>Then he asked for his forgiveness for entering their house to check on her.</p>



<p>Also, that he would like to be allowed to use part of the kitchen to take care of her.</p>



<p>Those were the four points Yuzuru conveyed to Naoki.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s okay&#8230; Sorry about it Yuzuru-kun. Please take care of my daughter.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No worries, Arisa is my fiancée after all&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Yuzuru-kun&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How does Yuzuru-kun &#8230;feel about Arisa?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p><em>What is he asking all of a sudden?</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but tilt his head.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s a very important person to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Hmm, I see. No, I&#8217;m sorry. That was a weird question to ask.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Naoki was also at work, so they couldn’t have a very long conversation.</p>



<p>Deciding to tell him about Arisa&#8217;s condition later, Yuzuru hung up the phone.<br> </p>



<p>After getting Naoki&#8217;s permission, Yuzuru went to Arisa&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>He rang the intercom and let her know that he had arrived.</p>



<p>After a while, the door opened slowly.<br> </p>



<p>In the doorway stood Arisa, wearing her nightgown and a jacket over it.</p>



<p>Her hair, usually neatly combed, was slightly disheveled.</p>



<p>She was wearing a mask that covered half of her face &#8230;but one could tell that her complexion was not good.<br> </p>



<p>“Good morning, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, &#8230;Goho geho&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>She coughed.</p>



<p>Thinking that it would not be good to allow it to get too chilly, Yuzuru quickly closed the door.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, did I wake you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s fine&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>For now, Yuzuru was guided by Arisa to her room.</p>



<p><em>(She doesn&#8217;t seem to be in very good shape.)</em></p>



<p>Although she was trying to look composed, her steps were a little unsteady.</p>



<p>Yuzuru decided that it would be better to stay with her for the rest of the day.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;This is my room.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>It was the first time he had seen Arisa&#8217;s room.</p>



<p>It was rather small, but the interior design was cute.</p>



<p>It was a very girlish room.</p>



<p>If Arisa hadn&#8217;t been sick, Yuzuru would have enjoyed it a little more.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I see. I have memorized the place. For now, you go back to sleep.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>After all, it was hard for Arisa too.</p>



<p>She crawled straight into bed.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Did you go to the hospital?　From the looks of it, it doesn&#8217;t look like you have&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; no, I haven&#8217;t. Ge ho~ &#8230; The fever is about 37 degrees, so I think I will be fine.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa, who said that&#8230; honestly didn&#8217;t seem to be doing too well.</p>



<p>However, if it&#8217;s only 37 degrees, then it’s probably not so urgent that she needs to go to the hospital right away.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; By the way, have you had lunch yet?　If you haven&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll get you some ready-to-eat porridge or some canned peaches.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Although Yuzuru could not make porridge by hand, he could at least manage to make it with ready-to-eat.</p>



<p>However, if the house already had it, he could just make use of it.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; Not yet. If you could get some for me, that would be great. We don&#8217;t have anything like that in the house &#8230;and I was having a little trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay. I&#8217;m going to get you some throat lozenges and some vitamin drinks as well. Is there anything else you want?　Do you have enough medicine?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got regular medication, so I&#8217;m good&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, but it would be helpful if you could also buy me some cooling pads&#8230; I&#8217;m out of those right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, Understood&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru told Arisa to call him on his cell phone if anything happened and then went to a nearby pharmacy to buy the necessary items.<br></p>



<p>There was no particular contact from Arisa, &#8230;but he ran back to the house, thinking of the possibility.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa, I&#8217;m back.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>He told Arisa in front of her room, but she didn&#8217;t answer.</p>



<p>He knocked on the door and went into her room.</p>



<p><em>(&#8230;Is she sleeping?)</em></p>



<p>With that thought, Yuzuru looked at Arisa&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>She seemed even paler than before.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; Yuzuru-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>With sweat on her face and her neat face distorted, Arisa opened her thin eyes.</p>



<p>She looked very painful and limp.</p>



<p>Yuzuru put his hand on Arisa&#8217;s forehead.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible fever&#8230; We&#8217;d better remeasure it. Can you measure it yourself?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru picked up a thermometer that was nearby and asked Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa gave a small nod and began to open the buttons of her nightgown one by one.</p>



<p>A neat white pair of undergarments came into view.</p>



<p>Yuzuru panicked and looked away.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Did you get a reading?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru received the thermometer from Arisa.</p>



<p>The reading was &#8230; 38.7 degrees.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;With this fever, you&#8217;d better go to the hospital. It could be the flu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; But how will I&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call you a cab.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru used his cell phone to call a cab.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there was an empty car nearby, and the cab came quickly.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa, can you stand?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru, who had finished preparing her insurance card and handbook, asked Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa looked dazed and nodded her head.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s okay&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>With a small nod, Arisa wobbled to her feet.</p>



<p>But soon she immediately stumbled back to her knees.</p>



<p>Yuzuru hurriedly supported her.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Take it easy. I&#8217;ll carry you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, no&#8230; Hey&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru told her one-sidedly and picked her up, ignoring Arisa&#8217;s confused voice.</p>



<p>It became a princess carry.</p>



<p>Arisa was surprised at first but soon became quiet, grabbing Yuzuru&#8217;s clothes with both hands.</p>



<p>Yuzuru walked with Arisa in his arms and put her in a cab, asking the driver to take them to the hospital.</p>



<div style="height:157px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Fortunately, it was not the flu.</p>



<p>They gave her some medicine for her runny nose and cough, as well as a fever reducer, and sent her home.</p>



<p>When they returned, it was already lunchtime.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa, do you have an appetite?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru asked as he put her back in bed.</p>



<p>She shook her head slightly.<br> </p>



<p>“Not really&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>However, the prescribed medicine said, &#8220;after meals&#8221;.</p>



<p>She can&#8217;t take the medicine without eating something.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Can you eat canned peaches?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; If it&#8217;s a little.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>So Yuzuru went to the refrigerator and took out a can of peaches that he had chilled.</p>



<p>He moved it to a suitable plate and took it along with a fork.</p>



<p>He helped Arisa up and put the plate in her hand.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;If it is too much for you, you can leave it. At least try to take a bite.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa stared vaguely at her plate.</p>



<p>Then she shifted her jade-green eyes to Yuzuru.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up? &#8230; Are you not able to eat?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s &#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s cheeks turned a slight shade of red.</p>



<p>It&#8230; seemed to be for a slightly different reason than the symptoms of a cold or fever.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p><em>Could it be that yellow peaches were better than white peaches?</em></p>



<p>And as Yuzuru was thinking about that&#8230;<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;please.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Feed it to me, please&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa said to Yuzuru with moist eyes.</p>
