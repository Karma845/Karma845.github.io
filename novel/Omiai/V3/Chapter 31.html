<h3>Chapter 31 – Those Who Sleep On Their Rights Are Not Worth Protecting</h3>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back.&#8221;</p>






<p>After parting ways with Yuzuru, Arisa opened the door and entered her home, feeling a little buoyant.</p>



<p>Not so long ago, coming back home had been a bit depressing&#8230;</p>



<p>But now, not so much.</p>



<p>The violence from her foster mother was gone, and so was the sarcasm.</p>



<p>Perhaps she was afraid of displeasing Yuzuru, or more strictly, the Takasegawa family.</p>



<p>Her adoptive mother is not happy about the engagement between Arisa and Yuzuru, but she knows in her rational mind that it is necessary for her husband&#8217;s business.</p>



<p>Therefore, if there was anything that Arisa felt bad about&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Arisa!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Arisa returned, the first person to react was the man who ran up to her.</p>



<p>It was Haruto Amagi.</p>



<p>He was currently at home because his university was on spring break.</p>







<p>&#8220;Did he do anything to you?&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Now, what was he misunderstanding?</em></p>



<p>This cousin was under the impression that Arisa hated Yuzuru and did not want to marry him.</p>



<p>&#8230;It is a fact that Arisa did not want to get married or have an arranged marriage, so she does not deny that.</p>



<p>But that was in the past, and now Arisa has strong feelings for Yuzuru, and sincerely wants to marry him.</p>



<p>So his concern was misplaced.</p>







<p>But&#8230; no matter how many times she explained it to him, he won&#8217;t listen.</p>



<p>So Arisa had given up.</p>







<p>&#8220;Not really&#8230; It was just a normal meal.”</p>







<p>If she were to be asked &#8216;Did he do anything to you?&#8217;, surely he did.</p>



<p>Yes, he proposed to her.</p>



<p>Arisa coldly replied to Haruto while suppressing her mouth that was about to grin a little.</p>







<p>It&#8217;s no use telling Haruto that Yuzuru proposed to her.</p>



<p>The person Arisa really needs to talk to is her foster father, Naoki Amagi.</p>







<p><em>Would he be coming home today?</em></p>







<p>With that thought in mind, Arisa took off her shoes and went into the house.</p>



<p>Then&#8230;</p>







<p>“You are back, Arisa&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; I&#8217;m just got back.&#8221;</p>







<p>Naoki welcomed her home.</p>



<p>Arisa thought it was an unusual situation to be in&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; Arisa. We need to talk.&#8221;</p>







<p>Somehow, she had a bad feeling about this.</p>



<p>This premonition&#8230; was the same as the one she had once had when Naoki had asked her if she was interested in matchmaking</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes. I understand.&#8221;</p>







<p>But she couldn&#8217;t refuse it.</p>



<p>Arisa gave a small nod.</p>




<p>In the living room, Arisa&#8217;s foster mother and her cousin Mei were already there.</p>



<p>Both of them were sitting around the table drinking tea together.</p>



<p>It seems that the two of them were talking together.</p>







<p>(<em>I wonder what he wanted to talk about&#8230; with the whole family together like this&#8230;</em>)</p>







<p>Arisa felt inexplicably anxious.</p>



<p>She clenched the ring on her ring finger.</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa has just returned. So let&#8217;s get into the main subject&#8230; It&#8217;s about the engagement of Arisa and Yuzuru-kun.&#8221;</p>







<p>With a thud, Arisa&#8217;s heart jumped.</p>



<p>Arisa felt an unpleasant sweat running down her back.</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Naoki called her name, Arisa straightened her back.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes. What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;As I said before&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to force you to get married. So if you don&#8217;t like it, we can call off this engagement.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Why?</em></p>



<p><em>Did he just come around to saying that after all this time?</em></p>







<p>One after another, unpleasant images came into Arisa&#8217;s mind.</p>







<p>Perhaps&#8230; Naoki had become opposed to the marriage of Arisa and Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Or maybe instead of adopting her, he wanted Yuzuru to marry his own daughter, Mei.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I dislike it&#8230; And if we were to annul it&#8230; won&#8217;t it cause trouble for Yuzuru-san and the rest of the Takasegawa family?　Naoki-san will also be inconvenienced&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>“It is certainly not desirable, but now is not too late. It&#8217;s not a formal engagement, but a temporary one. Besides&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Naoki looked at his daughter, Arisa&#8217;s cousin Mei.</p>



<p>The sixth-grader gave a small nod.</p>







<p>&#8220;If Arisa-san finds it difficult, I will be here to take over.&#8221;</p>







<p>Mei replied nonchalantly.</p>



<p>And as if in tune with Mei&#8217;s words, &#8230;somewhat happily, Emi Amagi &#8211; Arisa&#8217;s foster mother &#8211; clapped her hands.</p>







<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san would be better off with Mei than with the adopted child like Arisa.&#8221;</p>







<p>She then looked at Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa couldn&#8217;t help but cower at the strong hostility in her gaze.</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa. If you don&#8217;t like it, say so. It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>







<p>Haruto said in a soft cat-like voice.</p>



<p>But Arisa&#8217;s ears did not hear his voice.</p>







<p>(<em>Wh-what is this…? What is happening&#8230;?</em>)</p>







<p>From the pinnacle of happiness.</p>



<p>To the bottom of the valley of despair.</p>



<p>She felt as if she had been knocked down headfirst.</p>







<p>She couldn&#8217;t read the situation at all.</p>



<p>But what she did understood was &#8230;that if this continues, Arisa will not be able to marry Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;N-no, I-It&#8217;s really okay. And also&#8230; Breaking off engagement that has been going on for a year is going to be trouble. An-and above all, having Mei-chan to be my substitute is not a good idea is what I think&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Desperately, Arisa searched for a reason why she and Yuzuru should not break off their engagement.</p>



<p>She insisted that she can&#8217;t sacrifice Mei.</p>



<p>But&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>







<p>Mei said clearly.</p>



<p>Arisa couldn&#8217;t help but hold her tongue.</p>



<p>As long as Mei says she doesn&#8217;t mind, there is little reason why it should be Arisa who marries Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only seen him in photos, but Takasegawa-san is a very cool guy, and &#8230;he is also rich. So I&#8217;m not complaining. &#8230; Of course, if you really like Takasegawa-san and want to marry him, that is a different case&#8230; It&#8217;s not my intention to take away Arisa-san&#8217;s love interest.&#8221;</p>







<p>Mei said and looked at Arisa.</p>







<p><em>Do you like him or not? Do you want to get married or not?</em></p>



<p><em>Come on, make it clear.</em></p>



<p>It was as if she was saying that.</p>







<p>&#8220;But&#8230; Yuzuru-san seems to like me. I think it should be me after all instead of a replacement!&#8221;</p>







<p>The person who nominated Arisa was Yuzuru Takasegawa.</p>



<p>Yuzuru is madly in love with Arisa and wants to marry her.</p>







<p>Arisa wielded her greatest weapon.</p>



<p>That Mei can&#8217;t be a substitute.</p>







<p>But&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a strange reason!&#8221;</p>







<p>It was Haruto who raised his voice.</p>







<p>&#8220;Just because that guy&#8230;Yuzuru-kun, likes Arisa, doesn&#8217;t mean Arisa has to accommodate him, and there&#8217;s no reason she has to marry him! &#8230;It doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be Arisa, does it Dad.?&#8221;</p>







<p>Naoki nodded at Haruto&#8217;s question.</p>







<p>&#8220;I guess so&#8230; At least for the Takasegawa family, there is no reason why it has to be Arisa. As for Yuzuru-kun&#8230; well, it&#8217;s regrettable, but if Arisa doesn&#8217;t want to, however, I can&#8217;t force her&#8230; At least I am not going to force Arisa to do anything. He should be able to understand&#8230;. I&#8217;m going to try to persuade him to understand.&#8221;</p>







<p>Little by little.</p>



<p>It was like a game of Tsume-shogi.</p>



<p>&nbsp;(<strong>TN: </strong><em>Tsume-shogi- Tsume shogi or tsume is the Japanese term for a shogi miniature problem in which the goal is to checkmate the opponent&#8217;s king</em>)</p>



<p>Arisa felt that her escape route, her happy married life with Yuzuru, was being blocked.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>She had to say something.</p>



<p>If she doesn&#8217;t say something, her cousin will really take Yuzuru away from her.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s face turned pale and she tried to speak up, shaking, but&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa, don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;s okay. &#8230;No one is trying to force you to get married. You can be honest.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s voice was blocked by Haruto.</p>



<p>Unsure of what to do, Arisa silently looked down.</p>







<p>“&#8230;Then we will move forward like that&#8230; Okay?&#8221;</p>







<p>As if to emphasize the point, Naoki asked Arisa.</p>



<p>Her mind went blank and she could not answer anything.</p>







<p>“Then we&#8217;re done talking.&#8221;</p>







<p>He stood up.</p>



<p>With that, Emi looked happy, Haruto was somewhat relieved, and Mei&#8230;. had a stunned expression on her face.</p>



<p>They got up from the couch.</p>







<p>Arisa just sat on the couch and kept her head down&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa somehow managed to wrestle the words out of her mouth.</p>



<p>Naoki&#8217;s movement stopped as he was leaving the place.</p>
