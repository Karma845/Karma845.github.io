<h3>Chapter 8 – “Fiancée’s” Request” [Part 2]</h3>

<p>&#8220;Feed it to me, please&#8221;<br> </p> <p>When Arisa pleaded with him, Yuzuru was a little surprised.</p> <p>There have been many times when she has shown weakness, such as asking him to lend her his chest, but&#8230;</p> <p>It was the first time she had ever been this way.</p> <p></p> <p>(Well&#8230; She&#8217;s got a cold, so she must be feeling feeble.)</p> <p></p> <p>Of course, there was no reason to refuse.</p> <p>Yuzuru nodded, stabbed a small peach with the fork, and brought it to Arisa&#8217;s mouth.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Ahn&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Arisa delicately separated her lips and took the peach into her mouth.</p> <p>Slowly, he pulled the fork out of Arisa&#8217;s glossy lips.</p> <p>With a gulp, Arisa slowly moved her mouth and swallowed the peach.</p> <p>Then she opened her mouth a little.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;Give me more, please&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230; Ah.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Yuzuru felt a little weird, but he brought the peach to Arisa&#8217;s mouth.</p> <p>This was just nursing.</p> <p>But for some reason, it had a sensual feeling.</p> <p>At the same time, he felt protective, as if he was feeding a baby bird.</p> <p>Perplexed by this perverse feeling, Yuzuru finished feeding Arisa.<br></p> <p>He gave her some medicine along with water.</p> <p>He also replaced the ice pillow and cold patches.<br> </p> <p>&#8221; Yuzuru-san&#8230; um&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll be here until evening.&#8221;<br> </p> <p><em>I won&#8217;t be leaving any time soon.</em></p> <p>Yuzuru tried to reassure Arisa by telling her that.. but she shook her head.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;No, not that..&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Then? &#8220;</p> <p>&#8220;Hold my hand, please. Until I fall asleep&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p> <p>With moist eyes, Arisa asked him to do so.</p> <p>It seemed that she was emotionally distraught.<br></p> <p>Yuzuru gently wrapped his hand around Arisa&#8217;s hand.</p> <p>Her hand was very soft, beautiful, and taken care of.</p> <p>Arisa felt relieved and closed her eyes.<br> </p> <p>After a while, she started to fall asleep, breathing softly.</p> <p>Yuzuru took his hand away so as not to wake Arisa.<br> </p> <p>Then quietly&#8230; he left Arisa&#8217;s room.</p> <div style="height:133px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div> <p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san&#8230; Yuzuru-san&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p> <p>It was around 4:30 in the afternoon.</p> <p>Yuzuru, who was using his smartphone in the living room to look up information on how to nurse someone with a cold, stood up when he heard Arisa&#8217;s voice.</p> <p>Her voice sounded cute and lonely, like a baby bird calling out to its parents.</p> <p>Yuzuru quickly made his way to Arisa&#8217;s room.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p> <p>When Arisa saw Yuzuru&#8217;s face, a relieved expression appeared on her face.</p> <p>She seemed distressed that Yuzuru was not there when she woke up.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t want to risk contagion.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Of course, Yuzuru didn&#8217;t really care if he got infected, it was just a cold.</p> <p>But he thought that if he got infected, Arisa would be worried about it. <br> </p> <p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m aware of that. &#8230;I&#8217;m glad you stayed back.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Arisa then looked up at Yuzuru&#8217;s face.</p> <p>With flushed cheeks, lowered corners of the eyes, and moistened eyes &#8230; She looked as if she was pleading for something.</p> <p>Yuzuru did not know what Arisa was asking for, so he stroked her head anyway.</p> <p>Then Arisa closed her eyes and seemed to be comfortably pampered.</p> <p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle as he remembered his dog at home.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;Arisa, do you have an appetite?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Appetite&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p> <p>The moment Arisa was about to answer, a small sound was heard: &#8220;k~ur~&#8221;.</p> <p>Arisa&#8217;s face grew increasingly red.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;I want to eat something&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I see. I&#8217;ve bought some ready-to-eat porridge. I&#8217;ll heat it up. And you&#8217;re thirsty, aren&#8217;t you?　Would you like me to get you a drink first?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Yes, please.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Arisa gave a small nod.<br> </p> <p>First, Yuzuru took out the chilled bottle of the vitamin drink from the refrigerator and handed it to Arisa.</p> <p>After checking on Arisa, who was slurping down a bottle of drink, he went to the kitchen.</p> <p>Transferring the porridge to a plate, he heated it up in the microwave.</p> <p>He then took it to Arisa with a spoon.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Do you want me to feed you?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Yuzuru took a spoonful in his hand and blew on it to cool it down.</p> <p>Then slowly, he brought it to Arisa&#8217;s mouth.</p> <p>With a snap, Arisa took the spoon in her mouth.<br> </p> <p>Apparently, she was exhausted and hungry.</p> <p>She finished eating in no time.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;Do you want some canned peaches too?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;please.”<br> </p> <p>She looked a little underfed, so he gave her some of the canned peaches that were leftover from lunch.</p> <p>Then he gave her some medicine along with water and took her temperature.<br> </p> <p>Her fever had dropped to 37 degrees.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;For now, I&#8217;ll just change the pillow.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;um, first I need to ask you a favor.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;What is it?　Anything I can do to help you, I will.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>When Yuzuru said that, Arisa looked a little nervous and requested Yuzuru while blushing, probably because of the fever.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;I want to wipe myself down.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; That&#8217;s right.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>She had sweated a lot.</p> <p>She would want to wipe her body and change her clothes.</p> <p>Besides, the sheets might need to be changed.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you a wet towel.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Please&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Arisa nodded, looking nervous.</p> <p>While wondering why Arisa&#8217;s mood was a little strange, Yuzuru prepared several wet towels.<br></p> <p>&#8220;Then, Arisa. I&#8217;m going to leave the room, so wipe yourself off and change your clothes. I&#8217;ll change the sheets afterward.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230; Yes, thank you.&#8221;<br></p> <p>She nodded and picked up a towel.</p> <p>After confirming this, Yuzuru was about to leave the room, but&#8230;<br> </p> <p>“Wait, please.&#8221;<br> </p> <p>Arisa stopped Yuzuru with a faint voice.</p> <p>Yuzuru turned around to see what was wrong.<br> </p> <p>&#8220;What &#8230; O, oi!　What are you doing!&#8221;<br> </p> <p>When Yuzuru turned around, Arisa was opening the buttons of her nightgown one by one.</p> <p>Her breasts, slightly wet with sweat, and her neat white undergarments were peeking out.<br> </p> <p>When Arisa finished unbuttoning all the buttons,</p> <p>She turned her back.</p> <p>Then she took off her nightgown slightly, exposing her pure white shoulders.</p> <p>Then she turned her head slightly.</p> <p>His face was as red and flushed as a tomato.<br> </p> <p>“Well, Yuzuru-san&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p> <p>In a strangely lustrous voice, Arisa called Yuzuru&#8217;s name.</p> <p>Then with a voice trembling from embarrassment…, but clearly audible, she said.<br> </p> <p>“I can&#8217;t reach my back &#8230;can you wipe it for me?&#8221;<br> </p> <p>With that, she took off the top of her nightgown completely.</p> <p>Her white back, soaked with sweat and flushed rosy red, came into view.</p> <p>Only the hooks of her white bra were slightly covering her back.</p> <p>At the waist of her pants, the top of her panties, damp with sweat, peeked out.</p> <p>　</p> <p>&#8220;Um&#8230; please.&#8221; </p> <p>In a muffled voice, Arisa requested Yuzuru one more time.</p> <p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but gulp.</p>
