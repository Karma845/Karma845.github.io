<h3>Chapter 6 – Part-time Work Shifts</h3>

<p>And finally, he works at this restaurant.</p>



<p>Of these, tutoring is the most profitable, at 2,000 yen per hour.　</p>



<p>The lawyer&#8217;s chores pay 1,500 yen an hour.<br></p>



<p>However, these two jobs are only available once a week, and the shifts cannot be changed at will.</p>



<p>Therefore, the biggest earner is a part-time job as a waiter at the restaurant.</p>



<p>The hourly wage, by the way, is about one thousand fifty (1050) yen.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Would that be all right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be helpful if you do that, but will you be able to study? If Yuzuru-kun&#8217;s grades drop, I&#8217;ll get scolded by your parents.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Naturally.</p>



<p>The manager of this restaurant is also an acquaintance of Yuzuru&#8217;s parents.</p>



<p>Although&#8230; this was not a relationship with his father or &#8220;Takasegawa&#8221;, but with Yuzuru&#8217;s mother.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try not to cause any trouble for you, Hiromi-san.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Hiromi Hasegawa.</p>



<p>That was his name.</p>



<p>He is a very kind person and Yuzuru is very much indebted to him.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that the parents would entrust Yuzuru to him.<br> </p>



<p>&#8230;As for Yuzuru, he wanted to find a job for himself, but they wouldn&#8217;t let him.</p>



<p>There are bad people in this world, so it&#8217;s only natural.</p>



<p>In addition, &#8230; There&#8217;s a dirty adult reason that if Yuzuru were to do &#8216;something&#8217;, it would be easier to cover it up if you knew them.<br> </p>



<p>Of course, Yuzuru didn&#8217;t want to do anything of the sort.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I guess If it&#8217;s Yuzuru-kun, you can handle it. It would be a great help to the store&#8230; By the way, may I ask why? If you don&#8217;t want to tell, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to save up some money for White Day.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru replied that, Hiromi’s eyes widened as if to say, &#8220;he~e~&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then he smirked.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;What? If you are supposed to be receiving something, does that mean there is a girlfriend? And you said you had plans for Christmas as well. So you&#8217;re doing what you gotta do, huh, Yuzuru-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; She&#8217;s not really my girlfriend. She&#8217;s the one I like.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Arisa was not his girlfriend.</p>



<p>But she will surely give him Valentine&#8217;s Day chocolates&#8230; Or so Yuzuru was expecting.</p>



<p>If she didn&#8217;t, he would be seriously depressed.</p>



<p>Anyway, if it is certain that you will receive chocolates for Valentine&#8217;s Day, you should prepare a gift for White Day while you still can.</p>



<p>If the Christmas present was a jab, this time he intends to knock Arisa out with a real straight shot.</p>



<p>And for that, he needs a good amount of money.<br> </p>



<p>“Heh. &#8230;&#8230; So, if you become lovers, will you introduce her to me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Of course, I will, when that time comes&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>It&#8217;s only natural to introduce your future wife to the people who have treated you well.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, is she pretty?　Who does she look like?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru mentioned the name of a famous foreign actress.</p>



<p>Hiromi then tilted his head.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;You mean she&#8217;s from overseas?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mixed-race. Well, she was born and raised in Japan.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru told him information about Arisa as he was asked. But of course, he didn&#8217;t tell him anything about her personal life.</p>



<p>He said she was beautiful, a good cook, smart, athletic, and a wonderful woman.</p>



<p>Hiromi nodded his head in agreement.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-kun, you&#8217;re crazy about her, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t even deny it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true after all.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a fact that Yuzuru is crazy about Arisa, and it&#8217;s not something to be ashamed of.</p>



<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also the feeling of being a little embarrassed if people tease him.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not cool to be embarrassed, so he just stands proud.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Hiromi nodded as if he was convinced of something.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll add as many shifts as I can.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Hiromi then left the waiting room and scratched his head, looking a little troubled.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; What am I going to do to explain this to our girls?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p><em>Such a sinful man&#8230;</em></p>



<p>He mumbled quietly and sighed.</p>



<div style="height:133px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>A few days later, it was Saturday.<br>  </p>



<p>Basically, Saturday is &#8220;Arisa&#8217;s day&#8221;, and Yuzuru stays free.</p>



<p>As he was cleaning his room with a lot of energy since Arisa was coming&#8230;<br> </p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s cell phone rang.</p>



<p>It was from Arisa.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, hello. What&#8217;s up, Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I can&#8217;t come to your house today, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;]<br> </p>



<p>Her voice sounded somewhat different from the usual Arisa.</p>



<p>It was a little muffled.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Are you not feeling well?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>Come to think of it, Yuzuru recalled that she hadn&#8217;t looked so good yesterday.</p>



<p>Maybe it was a cold.<br> </p>



<p>[&#8220;Yes, &#8230;. Geho~! I caught a cold.&#8221;]<br> </p>



<p>It seems to be a cold, after all.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s not good to have a cold at this time.</p>



<p>This is because &#8230;<br> </p>



<p>“If I recall correctly, now you&#8217;re on your own right? I heard that your sister is staying at a friend&#8217;s house, and your mother is traveling with a friend&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>And of course, Naoki Amagi was at work.</p>



<p>Haruto Amagi was back at college.</p>



<p>Normally, she might say that it is rather comforting to have no one around&#8230; But it must be hard to be alone when she is sick.<br> </p>



<p>[&#8220;Geho, geho&#8230; It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll be fine if I sleep a little.&#8221;]<br> </p>



<p>That dialogue was very stubborn.</p>



<p>However&#8230; It actually made Yuzuru worry.</p>



<p>It was as if she was straining herself to keep Yuzuru from worrying about her.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure you&#8217;re okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;m fine. There&#8217;s no need to worry.&#8221;]<br> </p>



<p>There was a slight pause before she replied.　</p>



<p>It seems that she was bluffing after all.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt as if Arisa was asking for help.<br> </p>



<p>(<em>I&#8217;d like to respect Arisa&#8217;s wishes, but when it comes to illness&#8230;</em>)<br> </p>



<p>Even if it was just a mild cold, it could suddenly get worse.</p>



<p>It could be the flu.</p>



<p>　</p>



<p>This is not the time to be talking about respecting Arisa&#8217;s will.</p>



<p>Besides&#8230;<br></p>



<p>(<em>Although she says she&#8217;s fine, I feel like she desires help&#8230;</em> )<br> </p>



<p>It has been half a year since they first met.</p>



<p>He has come to be able to guess how Arisa feels to some extent.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m coming to visit you now.&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8220;Eh? No, but&#8230;&#8221;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you take care of me the last time I was injured?&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>It was when Yuzuru fell from a tree and sprained his ankle.</p>



<p>When he thinks about it now, that&#8217;s what brought him closer to Arisa.<br> </p>



<p>&#8220;Let me help you this time.&#8221;<br> </p>



<p>As Yuzuru said this&#8230;</p>



<p>After a moment of silence, he heard a slightly damp voice.<br> </p>



<p>[&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in your care&#8221;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Leave it to me&#8221;</p>


<br></br>
