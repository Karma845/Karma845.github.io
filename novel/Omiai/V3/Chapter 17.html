<h3>Chapter 17 – The Fragrance of “Fiancée”: Before</h3>


<p>After the marathon, Yuzuru went home with Arisa.</p>



<p>He had already finished his lunch.</p>






<p>&#8220;That was tiring.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa sat down on the carpet and muttered to herself.</p>



<p>She stretched out her long legs and slouched down.</p>



<p>But it seemed that though she was striking a tired pose, she was not really exhausted.</p>







<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; you&#8217;re right. It was never meant to be a contest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was a close one at the end, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. If you hadn&#8217;t cheered me on, I might have lost.&#8221;</p>







<p>When Yuzuru said that, Arisa opened her eyes wide.</p>



<p>Then she enquired.</p>







<p>&#8221; &#8230;Did you hear me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;If anything, I had a feeling you did.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru didn&#8217;t hear Arisa&#8217;s voice directly.</p>



<p>But he knew intuitively that Arisa was supporting him.</p>



<p>Arisa scratched her cheek in embarrassment when she heard Yuzuru&#8217;s response.</p>







<p>&#8221; I, I see&#8230; I was actually thinking of cheering loudly like Ayaka-san and the others, but I was a little embarrassed&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The feeling was definitely transmitted. It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>







<p>In the first place, if Arisa cheers loudly for Yuzuru, her classmates will realize that Yuzuru and Arisa have a close relationship like lovers&#8230;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a little early for that.</p>







<p>&#8220;B ,by the way, Yuzuru-san. Um&#8230; about the&#8230; bath&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa&#8217;s white skin flushed a rosy red, and she began to speak in a slightly raised voice.</p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded.</p>







<p>&#8220;Oh, I think it&#8217;s already heating up. I set the timer before I came.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is &#8230;is that so?&#8221;</p>







<p>For some reason, Arisa glanced at him with an upward glance.</p>



<p>She looked like she wanted to say something, but was too hesitant to do so.</p>



<p>Such an atmosphere was there.</p>







<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, uh&#8230; it&#8217;s nothing&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You want to take the bath first?　I don&#8217;t really mind.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Maybe she prefers to take the first bath.</em></p>



<p><em>But it is hard for her to say that she wants to take a bath before Yuzuru, the owner of the house&#8230;</em></p>



<p><em>Is that the reason?</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru tilted his head inwardly, thinking that.</p>







<p>But for something like that, he couldn&#8217;t see why she should be hesitant or embarrassed.</p>







<p>&#8220;I,&nbsp; I see!　Then I&#8217;ll take bath first!!&#8221;</p>







<p>But was Yuzuru&#8217;s point correct? It seemed so.</p>



<p>Arisa stood up, looking a little flustered.</p>







<p>&#8220;Um, I can add bath salts, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221;</p>







<p>Then she disappeared into the changing room.</p>



<p>After a while, the sound of the shower could be heard.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; I am getting restless.&#8221;</p>







<p>This was the second time that Arisa has used the bathroom at Yuzuru&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>But he felt strangely uncomfortable.</p>




<p>And that&#8217;s when Yuzuru noticed.</p>



<p>Arisa had disappeared into the bathroom without a change of clothes or a towel.</p>



<p>Since he had no choice, Yuzuru took Arisa&#8217;s bag and headed to the bathroom.</p>



<p>The bathroom door is made of frosted glass, so the inside cannot be seen &#8230;but the texture of the body was slightly visible.</p>



<p>Yuzuru gulped.</p>







<p><em>(&#8230; it, It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m trying to do anything shady.)</em></p>







<p>Yuzuru knocked on the door, calming himself down.</p>







<p>&#8220;Hey, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fu~eh? Yuzuru-san!? No, no, you shouldn&#8217;t, you know&#8230; This is indeed a little &#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about&#8230;?&#8221;</p>







<p>While Arisa squealed on the other side of the frosted glass, Yuzuru said in a calm voice.</p>



<p>Then Arisa also seemed to have calmed down.</p>



<p>A deliberate coughing sound could be heard.</p>







<p>&#8220;Kohon~.&nbsp; So&#8230; what is it? If you&#8217;re planning on peeking in, I&#8217;d splash water on you.&#8221;</p>







<p>Said Arisa in a rather cold voice.</p>



<p>At first glance, her voice sounded calm and collected, but at the same time, she seemed to be warning Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8230;However, is it just Yuzuru&#8217;s feeling that she&#8217;s faking it somewhat?&nbsp;</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not coming in&#8230; You forgot your change of clothes and towel, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>







<p>As Yuzuru said this, a voice of understanding could be heard from the bathroom.</p>







<p>&#8220;Uh, can you bring them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I brought my bag. It&#8217;s in here, isn&#8217;t it?　What do you want me to do?　Should I take it out?&#8221;</p>







<p>How far did Arisa bring a change of clothes, he did not know.</p>



<p>But if she had brought a change of underwear&#8230; it would have been embarrassing for a man to see it.</p>



<p>Just in case, Yuzuru decided to ask Arisa.</p>







<p>&#8220;Indeed, it is. I don&#8217;t want to go through my bag with wet hands, and I&#8217;d rather have it taken out&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>She was about to say that much.</p>







<p>&#8220;Aahh!!!　No, no, absolutely not!!　Please don&#8217;t open it!!&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa shouted loudly.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s hand stopped as he was about to open her bag.</p>







<p>&#8220;O, oh&#8230; I see.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru decided to leave the bag in front of the door obediently.</p>







<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t see, did you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Please don&#8217;t ever, ever look at it, okay?　If you see it, I&#8217;ll hate Yuzuru-san, okay!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;I understand.&#8221;</p>







<p>When she said that much, he was rather hurt.</p>







<p>As Yuzuru was about to leave the changing room, a little dejected&#8230; He suddenly realized.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s clothes were lying there.</p>



<p>Was she in a hurry, or was she more sloppy than expected?</p>



<p>She had taken off her clothes in a very messy manner.</p>







<p>A pair of top and bottom jerseys as well as a sweaty, damp gym uniform.</p>



<p>A set of shorts, bra, and camisole had been left behind.</p>







<p>“&#8230;.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa had a pleasant fragrance.</p>



<p>Whether it&#8217;s because Yuzuru likes Arisa, or because she smells good, to begin with, remains unknown.</p>



<p>Anyway, to Yuzuru, Arisa&#8217;s odor was a good one.</p>







<p>And today it was especially good.</p>



<p>The mixed scent of shampoo, sweat, coolant and the unique smell of a girl stimulated Yuzuru&#8217;s instincts many times on the way home.</p>







<p>And in front of him were the clothes that Arisa had worn for half a day.</p>



<p>It was so drenched in sweat that her undergarments could be seen through them&#8230; Needless to say, it had a strong &#8220;Arisa fragrance&#8221; to it.</p>







<p>When Arisa comes out of the bath, most of her &#8220;Arisa fragrance&#8221; will already be gone.</p>



<p>Of course, that&#8217;s all well and good, but&#8230;</p>



<p>He will not be able to enjoy her scent today anymore.</p>







<p>When he thought about it, he felt incredibly regretful to simply pass by the clothes in front of him.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;To begin with, what was it? Saying that if I open the bag, she&#8217;ll hate me.&#8221;</p>







<p><em>I mean, no matter what it is, isn&#8217;t it terrible?</em></p>



<p><em>If you don&#8217;t want to be seen, you shouldn&#8217;t have brought it.</em></p>



<p>Yuzuru was a little hurt by what she had just said.</p>



<p><em>Then&#8230; wouldn&#8217;t he have the right to get even?</em></p>







<p>&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s Arisa&#8217;s fault. Yes, it&#8217;s your fault. It&#8217;s really suspicious that she would go into a man&#8217;s room without caution and take off her clothes like this. What&#8217;s going on with the Amagi family education?&#8221;</p>







<p>Muttering something like that, Yuzuru squatted down.</p>



<p>There were the clothes of Arisa in front of him.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;It is not my fault. It&#8217;s Arisa who&#8217;s bad. She&#8217;s really a bad girl.&#8221;</p>







<p>While saying that, Yuzuru picked up Arisa&#8217;s gym uniform.</p>



<p>It was slightly damp.</p>



<p>And&#8230;</p>



<p>He put it near the tip of his nose.</p>




<p>“Ha~a&#8230; what are you doing, me?&#8221;</p>







<p>Later.</p>



<p>Yuzuru sat slumped on the sofa, self-loathing.</p>
