<h3>Chapter 30 – Fiancée</h3>

	
<p>That moment.</p>




<p>It felt like an eternity to Yuzuru.</p>







<p>The place was dominated by silence.</p>



<p>It was as if time had stood still.</p>



<p>Only the sound of their hearts was marking the passing of time.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>A small voice broke the silence.</p>



<p>And then Arisa moved her lips and answered Yuzuru&#8217;s feelings clearly.</p>







<p>&#8220;With pleasure!&#8221;</p>







<p>As soon as she said that, Arisa almost collapsed from her chair into an embrace with Yuzuru.</p>



<p>In a panic, Yuzuru caught Arisa in his arms.</p>




<p>The body of his &#8220;fiancée&#8221;, no, his fiancée<sup><a href="https://impatientmtlreader533234643.wordpress.com/2021/08/11/fiancee-v3-ep-30/#1-1"><strong>1</strong></a></sup>, was very soft and warm.</p>







<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too slow&#8230; Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I was trying to make you happy. Can you please forgive me?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Yes. I forgive you&#8230; It really is the best proposal.&#8221;</p>







<p>With that, Arisa stepped back slightly and revealed her countenance to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>There were tears in her jade green eyes.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8216;I like you, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know&#8230; I love you, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I know&#8230; I love you, too.&#8221;</p>







<p>(<strong>TN: </strong><em>Please understand that Arisa first says “suki desu” which means I like you/I love you. But Yuzuru replies with “Aishite iru” which means I love you but in a heavier meaning. And Arisa replies the same.</em>)</p>







<p>For the first time.</p>



<p>The two of them said what they had in mind and confirmed it to each other.</p>



<p>And then they hugged each other again.</p>







<p>To be able to feel each other&#8217;s heat and softness more deeply.</p>



<p>As if to confirm their feelings, their fondness, and their love for each other.</p>



<p>As if to bind each other, never to let go.</p>



<p>Tightly, firmly, they brought each other&#8217;s bodies together with their arms.</p>







<p>It was a time of sweetness and indulgence, like sugar water.  (<strong>TN: </strong><em>Sugar water (satoumizu) is sweetened water drank in summer</em>)</p>



<p>And they wished to be immersed in that nectar forever.</p>



<p>Hopefully, in a world of just the two of them&#8230; forever.</p>







<p>&#8230;But that was not how things work.</p>







<p>&#8220;Arisa, can you stand up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru stood up first and gently took his fiancee&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>Arisa took the hand offered by her fiancé and slowly stood up.</p>







<p>Both of their faces were flushed, as if in a fever.</p>







<p>&#8220;Um, Yuzuru-san. &#8230;could you please?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa held out her left hand.</p>



<p>Yuzuru took her hand.</p>







<p>He then fitted her white, thin, beautiful ring finger with &#8230;a ring.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s get married, Arisa. I will definitely make you happy.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru told Arisa once again.</p>



<p>Arisa smiled and nodded vigorously.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yes! I will be in your care!!&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa accepted Yuzuru&#8217;s feelings.</p>




<p>On the way home.</p>







<p>As usual, Yuzuru walked Arisa to her house.</p>



<p>The only difference is that their relationship has changed from a fake &#8220;fiancée&#8221; to a normal fiancée.</p>







<p>&#8220;I was expecting something to happen&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t expect you to propose to me.&#8221;</p>







<p>She said in a cheerful voice with a bouncy gait.</p>



<p>Her white skin was slightly red as if her excitement had not yet cooled down.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that you are pleased&#8230; Look, you said before, didn&#8217;t you, that &#8216;a romantic confession would be nice&#8217;&#8230;? I think I tried my best, but how was it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was the best.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa turned around and said, folding her hands behind her back happily.</p>



<p>She had a big smile on her face as if a flower had bloomed.</p>







<p>(<em>Ah&#8230; this is what I wanted to see.</em>)</p>







<p>It was worth the effort.</p>



<p>Yuzuru felt his own expression soften naturally.</p>







<p>&#8220;&#8230; By the way, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it, Arisa?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How much did you spend?&#8221;</p>







<p>With a serious expression, Arisa asked as she looked into Yuzuru&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>Unlike before, Yuzuru noticed that Arisa&#8217;s voice sounded a little different.</p>







<p>&#8220;Eh? No&#8230; It&#8217;s not something you should be concerned about&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Yuzuru-san&#8217;s fiancée, remember?&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa then closed in on Yuzuru.</p>







<p>&#8220;I have a right to know what you spend and how much you spend&#8230; especially if it has to do with me. Isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;that&#8217;s true, too, I suppose.&#8221;</p>







<p>Yuzuru scratched his cheek&#8230;</p>



<p>And he told her the price.</p>







<p>&#8220;Uh, about ten thousand yen?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t worry. I paid for it properly with my part-time job earnings&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p><em>Pokan~.</em></p>



<p>Arisa tapped Yuzuru lightly on the head.</p>



<p>Arisa had a stunned look on her face.</p>







<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an amount of money a high school student should be paying&#8230; What were you thinking?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, the engagement ring was more expensive than I expected&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230; true that I was really happy, but there were other options. You know, like roses and all&#8230; you didn&#8217;t have to buy a diamond engagement ring&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said with a shocked look on her face.</p>



<p>In response to this, Yuzuru attempted to reassure her.</p>







<p>&#8220;Look, you said it before right&#8230; About how you liked the five great jewelers&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, you took that to heart? No&#8230; I&#8217;m happy that you remembered, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa said shyly as she played with her hair in response to Yuzuru&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>She seemed to be ashamed of her rather worldly hobby of liking branded products.</p>







<p>&#8220;I mean, was that amount really enough?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s among the cheaper ones&#8230; Even so, I&#8217;m sure the quality isn&#8217;t bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can tell by looking at it&#8230; Really, thank you very much.&#8221;</p>







<p>As she said that, Arisa happily looked at the ring on her ring finger.</p>



<p>Her mouth loosened slightly&#8230; and she smiled.</p>



<p>In any case, she seemed to be happy to receive a branded product.</p>







<p>&#8220;But, Yuzuru-san.&#8221;</p>







<p>However, Arisa immediately tightened her grin.</p>



<p>She put her hands on her hips and peered into Yuzuru&#8217;s face with an expression that showed that she was angry.</p>







<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t push yourself too hard, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s for your sake&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I appreciate the sentiment, but if you let that happen, you will have no limits!&#8221;</p>







<p>Certainly, he had no hesitation in spending hundreds of thousands of yen for Arisa&#8217;s sake.　</p>



<p>In fact, he thought that it was a rather cheap price.</p>







<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m flattered by your love, Yuzuru-san, but &#8230;&#8230; you see, money is finite. And more than anything&#8230; I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to be corrupted&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true. I can&#8217;t say no to you when you ask me for something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s exactly it!　Please say no! &#8230;Well, Yuzuru-san may think that I&#8217;m a firm person or a pure and humble type. But I&#8217;m probably the type of person who, if not careful, will loosen the purse strings&#8230;&#8221;</p>







<p>Embarrassed, Arisa said as she lowered her eyes.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Yuzuru thought that Arisa was a &#8221; firm &#8221; person, but he didn&#8217;t think that she was a pure and humble type.</p>







<p>Because&#8230;</p>







<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re rather fond of brands and expensive things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230; please stop&#8230; Hearing it said out loud is&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to be embarrassed about. My sister and mother love brand-name goods.&#8221;</p>







<p>The so-called &#8220;rich&#8221; members of the Takasegawa family are reasonably spendthrifts.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s sister and mother don&#8217;t spend a lot of money on things they are not interested in, but on the other hand, they don&#8217;t even look at the price tag of things they like.</p>



<p>And his father, who complains about his sister&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s clothing expenses, buys a foreign car that he doesn&#8217;t even drive.　</p>



<p>Even Yuzuru, who secretly thinks that a wagon is enough for a car, asks for an appropriate watch for his birthday.</p>



<p>His four dogs are also money-eaters.</p>







<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s childhood friends, Ayaka and Chiharu, also spend a lot of money on clothes and ornaments.</p>







<p>But to Yuzuru, Arisa&#8217;s love for brand-name products is in the &#8220;cute&#8221; category.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s more of a natural desire.</p>







<p>&#8220;P-please stop&#8230; That&#8217;s the only thing I&#8217;m worried about in my marriage with you. It&#8217;s really dangerous to have money available when you want to spend it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Well, if you insist. However, even the earliest you can get married is after high school graduation&#8230; It&#8217;s still a long way off, though.&#8221;</p>







<p>Getting married while still in high school is not a good choice in terms of public opinion.</p>



<p>According to common sense, it should be at least after high school graduation, and possibly after college graduation.</p>







<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s also true&#8230; I was a little too hasty.&#8221;</p>







<p>Arisa smiled shyly.</p>



<p>Yuzuru couldn&#8217;t help but smile as well.</p>







<p>The two of them walked down the street at night, holding hands.</p>



<p>They thought it would be nice if their time together could last forever.</p>



<p>However, the further they went, the closer the time of parting became.</p>







<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san. Can I talk to my adoptive father &#8230;about this engagement?&#8221;</p>







<p>In front of Arisa&#8217;s house, Arisa asked Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Yuzuru nodded eagerly.</p>







<p>&#8220;Of course. Tell your father that I really love you and want to marry you&#8230; I&#8217;ll also inform my father about it.&#8221;</p>







<p>Up until now, Yuzuru and Arisa had been officially treated as temporary fiancées.</p>



<p>But Yuzuru was planning to have their relationship upgraded to an official fiancée.</p>



<p>That way, he would be able to actively show Arisa&#8217;s face to the relatives and business associates of the Takasegawa family&#8230;</p>



<p>Whenever Yuzuru goes out in public, Arisa will be invited as his partner.</p>



<p>In other words, Yuzuru and Arisa will become fiancée in both name and reality.</p>







<p>&#8220;I understand. Then, Yuzuru-san&#8230; See you tomorrow at school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, see you.&#8221;</p>







<p>The two of them embraced each other as if to say farewell, firmly imprinting each other&#8217;s body heat and feelings.</p>





<p>Even though they were engaged, it did not dramatically change their relationship.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that the fake &#8220;fiancée&#8221; has turned into a real fiancée.　</p>



<p>Perhaps similar days will continue in the future.</p>







<p>But still&#8230;</p>







<p>Their relationship had moved forward significantly.</p>
