<h3>Chapter 5 - Fiancee's Home Cooking</h3>

<p>“I’m sorry for everything” I sat down on the bed, and thanked Arisa for cleaning my room. I can only watch and express my gratitude, I would have gotten in her way with these crutches even if I wanted to help. I am very sorry for that.</p>



<p> On the other hand, Arisa looked as if nothing happened.</p>



<p>“For now, I have only tidy up the trash. So I will come back later to clean up.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to go that far…”</p>



<p>“I just don’t like ending things halfway.”</p>



<p>Arisa replies to me in tsundere attitude. Then after looking around at the dressing room she just cleaned. She asks me.</p>



<p>“Takasegawa-san, what are you going to do about bath? What did the doctor say?”</p>



<p>“They told me not to enter bath for two to three days, so until yesterday I just wiping myself.”</p>



<p>Yesterday was the third day, so from today, I can enter the bathroom (although I can’t soak in bathtub yet). Even for me, for three days, it was mentally difficult to just wipe my body, so today I will definitely take a bath.</p>



<p>“How are you going to enter?”</p>



<p>“Well, I can’t enter bathroom with the crutches, so I will just use my one leg to enter.”</p>



<p>I just have to sit down to take a bath, so I can use my one leg to reach the bathroom. Now that trash are gone, it will be a lot easier to move around.</p>



<p>But…</p>



<p>“That sounds a little dangerous. The Tiles in bathroom are slippery.”</p>



<p>“You’re overreacting…&#8230;and my legs are already quite healed. If I do my best I can even walk without crutches…”</p>



<p>“If you act carelessly like that, you’re going to fall again. I’ll help you.”</p>



<p>Helping, which would mean taking me to the bathroom. I am very happy about that feeling but…</p>



<p>“How?&#8230;I can’t wash my body while wearing clothes.”</p>



<p>“I know&#8230;I’m thinking a bit now. Well, do you have a swimsuit or a jersey?”</p>



<p>First, I will wear swimsuit underneath with jersey on top. In that state, I will sit on a chair in bathroom, with Arisa supporting me. After that, Arisa will go out and hang the jersey on the towel bar. After washing my body, I will put on the jersey and get out of the bathroom with the help of Arisa.</p>



<p>That is Arisa’s strategy.</p>



<p>“No, you don’t have to do that much…I didn’t get engaged with you because I wanted you to owe me a favor. It’s okay, you don’t have to go that far. &#8230;You don’t like that, do you?”</p>



<p>It’s a little embarrassing to let a girl help me take a bath, and I am grateful for the help. But Arisa wouldn’t want to touch a man for a long time she doesn’t even like, even if&#8230;it’s not direct skin-to-skin contact.</p>



<p>It’s true that I helped her, but I didn’t help her because I wanted something in return. It will feel like I am making her work for me in exchange for gratitude, and I feel bad about it.</p>



<p>However, Arisa shook her head side by side.</p>



<p>“It’s okay.”</p>



<p>“No, but…”</p>



<p>“It would be more annoying if Takasegawa-san fell down again and made another injury or made it even worse. I can’t ignore it mentally. Do you understand?”</p>



<p>When I think about it, If I look at it from Arisa’s perspective. Certainly, after Arisa went back, if she heard that I injured myself&#8230;she will probably blame herself for not helping me.</p>



<p>“All right, but I will definitely pay you back next time.”</p>



<p>After that, I went to dressing room to change into swimsuit and jersey. Then, with the help of Arisa I went into the bathroom.</p>



<p>“When you are done bathing, please hit the door. I’ll be waiting.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I understand.”</p>



<p>I washed my hair and body while sitting. Taking a shower for the first time after three days feels good&#8230;I thanked Arisa inwardly.</p>



<p>After washing my body safely, I wipe my body with the bath towel hung on the towel bar. Then I put on a jersey.</p>



<p>(Even if I don’t get a help from Arisa, I can get out by myself if I wanted to.)</p>



<p>While standing on a one leg, I looked at the boundary between the bathroom and the dressing room. If I just open the door and jump powerfully, I can jump over it. It’s not that difficult.</p>



<p>(&#8230;But, I’m still worried.)</p>



<p>However, my foothold is a slippery bathroom. And if my jump fails, there is no doubt I will fall grandly.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro, I’m done.”</p>



<p>I hit the glass door while saying so. Then, Arisa opened the door nervously and stepped into the bathroom after making sure I was properly dressed in a jersey.</p>



<p>“I will be supporting you, so jump with pyon!” (TN: Here Arisa says pyon (ぴょん) which means to say jump in a cute way.)</p>



<p>“Okay”</p>



<p>I jumped over the step with all the strength on one leg, thinking that I shouldn’t make any cute expression.</p>



<p>Then I sat down in the dressing room.</p>



<p>“Thanks”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome. Please call me when you have changed your clothes.”</p>



<p>“Oh, okay.”</p>



<p>After I changed my clothes, I called out to Arisa. With her support I got up and received the crutches from her.</p>



<p>I opened the door of the dressing room, and went out to the living room. Then I sat down on the bed.</p>



<p>“Hmm…It’s a hassle just to take a bath.”</p>



<p>“Don’t remove your crutches just because it’s a hassle. Do what your doctor told you to do for at least a week…”</p>



<p>“I know”</p>



<p>If I hadn’t been told by Arisa, I would have abandoned it long ago. Now that I have been told, I can’t do it.</p>



<p>“By the way, can I take a look at refrigerator?”</p>



<p>“Sure, but&#8230;there is nothing in it.”</p>



<p>“Thank you. It saved me a lot of time to look at.”</p>



<p>After saying that, Arisa opens the fridge. And let out a sigh.</p>



<p>“There’s really nothing in it. &#8230;What are you going to do with your meals?”</p>



<p>“There are cup ramen and ready-made curry. Well, if you can get me a convenience store bento, that will be great.”</p>



<p>“Is that what you usually do?”</p>



<p>“I try to eat as many vegetables I can, but…”</p>



<p>“Sigh…”</p>



<p>Arisa sighed and thought for a while. She looked struggling with something for few dozen seconds or so, and then she suddenly walked up to the front door.</p>



<p>“I will go and buy something. Please wait here for a bit.”</p>



<p>Apparently, it seems like she is going to buy me a convenience store bento. As I can’t move around much, I’m really grateful that she is going to buy me a bento.</p>



<p>“Sorry”</p>



<p>“It can’t be helped. Cooking will be difficult with that foot … Well, it doesn’t seem to make a big difference.”</p>



<p>She says with a hint of sarcasm.</p>



<p>It’s true that I can’t cook, whether I have injury or not, so there’s no point in arguing.</p>



<p>While I was reading newspaper and waiting for Arisa, she bought a lot of something. It was the raw ingredients, including rice. While thinking, it can’t be, I asked.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yukishiro. You, no matter how you look they don’t look like a convenience store bentos.”</p>



<p>“It’s natural. If you live such a unhealthy life, things that can be cured will not be cured. I will use the kitchen. Please wait for about 30 to 40 minutes.”</p>



<p>Arisa unilaterally said so, rolled her sleeves and began to wash the rice. The ingredients that have been already bought cannot be wasted so I could only wait for food to be ready.</p>



<p>After a while, a very nice fragrance tickled my nose.</p>



<p>“I could only make simple things.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;simple things?”</p>



<p>White rice.</p>



<p>Root vegetable miso soup.</p>



<p>Grilled pork ginger.</p>



<p>Boiled Spinach.</p>



<p>Salad.</p>



<p>A soup and three vegetables, it was well prepared.</p>



<p>“This is simple…?”</p>



<p>“The pork is just grilled, the spinach is just boiled, and the salad is just shredded!”</p>



<p>“Doesn&#8217;t that fall into the &#8230;&#8230; rather cumbersome category?”</p>



<p>“I usually cook daily. And I&#8217;ve never missed a four-course dinner, so I&#8217;m skimping on this one. So don&#8217;t worry about it.”</p>



<p>I sip on the miso soup after saying “Itadaimasu”.</p>



<p>The flavor of bonito and miso spreads in my mouth.</p>



<p>“It’s delicious &#8230;&#8230; The most delicious thing I&#8217;ve ever eaten!”</p>



<p>When I let out my honest opinion.</p>



<p>Somehow, Arisa froze with her jade-colored eyes wide open.</p>



<p>“Yukishiro, are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Oh no, I&#8217;m sorry. It was the first time I was praised for my cooking. &#8230;&#8230; Is it that delicious?”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s already &#8230; well, it&#8217;s hard to explain when asked how delicious it is &#8230; but I think it&#8217;s much more delicious than a bad restaurant. Or rather, this is made from dried bonito, right? It&#8217;s amazing. &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry to make you go through the trouble. Thank you very much”</p>



<p>“Is that so. &#8230;&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s unpleasant to be told that it tastes bad when I was the one who made it, so let&#8217;s accept it obediently.”</p>



<p>It was only for a moment that Airisa showed signs of agitation. But she immediately returned to her usual cool expression and held her luggage in her hands.</p>



<p>“Well, I’ve finished feeding you today, so I’m going home now.”</p>



<p>“Eh, feed…”</p>



<p>Before I can complain her about the horrible word, Airisa speaks to me in a flat voice and briefly says only the necessary information.</p>



<p>“Please keep the washcloths in water. I&#8217;ll wash them tomorrow. And I have left some spinach and miso soup. By the way, I also have left some rice balls. Everything is in the refrigerator. Please eat it in the morning. I&#8217;ll check on you tomorrow, okay?”</p>



<p>“Okay”</p>



<p>I had no choice but to only node when she that said with a nonchalant attitude.</p>



<p>“See you tomorrow”, I said while seeing off Arisa who looked like she was trying to escape.</p>



<p>“Maybe she’s a shy person?”</p>



<p>I was a little bit surprised to learn about the unexpected side of Arisa Yukishiro.</p>
