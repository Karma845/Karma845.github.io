<h3>Chapter 19 - Fiancee's Swimsuit</h3>

<p>&#8220;The pool is it?”</p>



<p>From the other end of the phone, he could hear Arisa&#8217;s agitated voice.　</p>



<p>It was no good after all, Yuzuru sighed inwardly.</p>



<p>It all happened about an hour ago.</p>



<p>About an hour ago, Yuzuru&#8217;s grandfather suddenly told him, &#8220;I got it as a shareholder&#8217;s gift. You and Yukishiro-san should go there&#8221;, and presented Yuzuru with two tickets to a famous swimming amusement facility.</p>



<p>Yes, a swimming pool.</p>



<p>Going to the pool means wearing a swimsuit.</p>



<p>Wearing a swimsuit means exposing your skin.</p>



<p>Arisa is not used to men, and she is not good at looking at men&#8217;s skin.</p>



<p>She also doesn&#8217;t like to expose her skin either</p>



<p>Yuzuru would be lying if he said he didn&#8217;t want to&#8230;, well, see Arisa in her swimsuit, but he would probably be nervous to see it in front of him.</p>



<p>It was obvious that he would not be able to play properly because of his nervousness and embarrassment.</p>



<p>As for Yuzuru, he wanted to refuse.</p>



<p>But when somebody said to him, &#8220;Most lovers go to the pool or the beach in the summer,&#8221; he couldn&#8217;t argue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Er, well, &#8230;&#8230; yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A pool &#8230;&#8230;! So that means you have to wear a swimsuit?&#8221;</p>



<p>At first, she seemed flustered, but soon Airisa&#8217;s voice regained its composure.</p>



<p>Since she was on the phone, it was hard to detect her emotions.</p>



<p>However, she probably didn&#8217;t want to go.</p>



<p>The Yukishiro Arisa that Yuzuru knew would not want to go to the pool with a man she didn&#8217;t like.</p>



<p>&#8221; After all, you don&#8217;t like it, do you? Yeah, I&#8217;ll tell the old man that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Are you sure it’s okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll back off if I say something to the effect that Yukishiro is embarrassed to be seen by other visitors, or that she doesn&#8217;t want other men to see her skin.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru wouldn&#8217;t force her, no matter how much he wanted to.</p>



<p>But instead, they need to go to an amusement park or a movie theater or something like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;but it is difficult, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>“No, well&#8230;&#8230;it isn&#8217;t exactly easy.&#8221;</p>



<p>How many girls today would say they are embarrassed to wear a swimsuit at the pool?　</p>



<p>And what do they do in swimming classes at school in the first place?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t a few questions to ask.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can go if you want to.&#8221;</p>



<p>A calm and collected voice replied.</p>



<p>It was a very gratifying reply for Yuzuru&#8230; but it made him feel uneasy.</p>



<p>Because he was not sure if she&#8217;s pushing herself too hard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you not uncomfortable?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was Takasegawa-san who said, &#8216;If you don&#8217;t like it, say so&#8217;. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to go, so we can go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Aren&#8217;t you embarrassed to go in a swimsuit?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of TPO. It&#8217;s not strange to wear a swimsuit at the pool&#8230;&#8230; In the first place, we wear swimsuits during swimming lessons.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is as she said.</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, is that how it is? Am I just being overly concerned about it?</p>



<p>Yuzuru tilted his head internally.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, but of course. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I will not go to the pool with a guy I don&#8217;t like, in principle. I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but I wouldn&#8217;t go, and I don&#8217;t want to go. I&#8217;m not a social butterfly and I don&#8217;t want to be misunderstood as having an interest in someone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said this clearly.</p>



<p>Then she continued her words without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not going to misunderstand me, are you, Takasegawa-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well &#8230;&#8230;, I guess so. I&#8217;m not going to ask you out if we&#8217;re not engaged to begin with.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about. In addition, Takasegawa-san is harmless, right? If you are a harmful person to me, I&#8217;m sure your mask would have come off by now&#8230;&#8230; Well, maybe you&#8217;re good at hiding it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To call it harmful or harmless, It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m a pest or vermin&#8230;&#8230;. Well, they do say men are wolves.&#8221;</p>



<p>Is it that Yuzuru does not have an immoral heart at all?　It&#8217;s not like that.</p>



<p>It is just on the level of a normal high school boy&#8217;s desire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you a wolf too, Takasegawa-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;d say about as big as a properly disciplined dog.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right? But I&#8217;m a cat person, so I don&#8217;t like you Takasegawa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. By the way, I&#8217;m a dog person.&#8221;</p>



<p>The information about whether you are a dog person or a cat person is not that important in this situation.</p>



<p>But of course, if the other party intends to have a discussion, Yuzuru was willing to accept it.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the first place, the engagement was brought up by me. Takasegawa-san agreed to do this to protect me, so it is only logical that I should cooperate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t have to feel obligated to that extent&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>“A week ago, I bought a new swimsuit in case a girl in my class might ask me out. The fact that Takasegawa-san asked me out was unexpected, but &#8230;&#8230; well, it&#8217;s not bad timing either.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that she doesn’t like it. Rather she was keen on it.</p>



<p>Arisa insisted on it.</p>



<p>And Yuzuru doesn’t feel like he’s taking advantage of her in any way. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>After going this far, it would be disrespectful for him to reject it by assuming that &#8220;No, you won&#8217;t like it either&#8221;.</p>



<p>If that was the case, he shouldn’t have contacted her from the beginning.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, okay. As for the location and date and time&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay. Please wait a moment. I&#8217;ll write it down now.&#8221;</p>






<p>Later on.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, who had already finished changing into his swimsuit, was waiting for Arisa at the poolside.</p>



<p>There were a few men around waiting for their partner as well as Yuzuru.</p>



<p>This kind of thing makes one feel as if he&#8217;s her boyfriend.</p>



<p>However, Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t think of Arisa as a love interest, and vice versa.</p>



<p>Even though they don&#8217;t like each other, they pretend to be lovers.</p>



<p>What a valuable experience.</p>



<p>&#8211;It will remain in my memory for the rest of my life. For better or worse.</p>



<p>As he was thinking this, he noticed that the eyes of the men around him were drawn to a certain point.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, too, turned his gaze towards it as if caught by it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Oh.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unintentionally, a voice of admiration leaked out from him.</p>



<p>Arisa in a swimsuit was so beautiful.</p>



<p>Even Yuzuru, a self-proclaimed big dog, couldn&#8217;t help but admire this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san. I would appreciate it if you would say something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru came back to his senses when he received a raised eyebrow and a cold stare.</p>



<p>And he then again examined Airisa&#8217;s swimsuit.</p>



<p>The first thing that comes to attention is that the swimsuit is, surprisingly, a triangle bikini.</p>



<p>And it was black.</p>



<p>The design was not only black but also had a white pattern near the edges and a stylish large bow in the middle.</p>



<p>Her pure white skin looked great against the black swimsuit.</p>



<p>He felt that her skin, which was as smooth and lustrous as white porcelain, was emphasized even more.</p>



<p>Since she was wearing a bikini, Yuzuru&#8217;s eyes were naturally drawn to the top, middle and bottom.</p>



<p>She has a slender body, which gives the impression of being thin overall, but the parts that emerge are there.</p>



<p>First, the smooth decollete line from the neck to the collarbone.</p>



<p>From there, a dazzling white cleavage with beautifully budding fruit.</p>



<p>From underneath, the figure slims down in a smooth curve to the navel, which is beautifully rounded and well-shaped.</p>



<p>After that point, it suddenly begins to round off to the side, and even from the front, you can imagine the line of the back part.</p>



<p>The two long, thin legs stretching out from the black bathing suit were a sight to behold.</p>



<p>She was wearing a light blue rash guard, so you couldn&#8217;t see her arms, which was a shame, but he thought this rather stimulated the imagination.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, &#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s the thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What ?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little disappointed right now that you&#8217;re not my real fiancée.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a half-joking tone&#8230;&#8230;, Yuzuru complimented Arisa on her swimsuit.</p>



<p>Maybe because she recognized it as a joke, Arisa gave a small laugh.</p>



<p>&#8220;That’s a shame. &#8230;&#8230; Takasegawa-san also looks good. I know you do muscle training at home and you had said that you go to the gym with your friends, So it was true.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. &#8230;&#8230; Well, men also care about their body shape to some extent.&#8221;</p>



<p>It may not be as much as women, but a sloppy figure is still embarrassing.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a good thing he exercises regularly.</p>


<p>&#8220;But, Yukishiro&#8230;&#8230;well, what to say? I thought you were the type to be shy about this sort of thing”</p>



<p>Exposing your skin, and even seeing a man&#8217;s skin.</p>



<p>This is a place where there is an indeterminate number of men and women, and inevitably, unknown men will see your skin and you will have to see the skin of unknown men.</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you it&#8217;s a matter of TPO, didn&#8217;t I? Also, please don&#8217;t point it out. If you&#8217;re conscious of it, it&#8217;s just plain embarrassing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa’s skin had turned a rosy color.</p>



<p>It seems that she is embarrassed by embarrassing things.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about that. &#8230;&#8230; Where do you want to go first?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, &#8230;&#8230; I want to relax and play first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s go to the flowing pool.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two of them started walking towards the flowing pool area.</p>
