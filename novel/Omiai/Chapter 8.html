<h3>Chapter 8 - Fiancee and Flattery</h3>

<p>“By the way, Yukishiro.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>While playing the game, I called out to Arisa. Who replied with her eyes on the screen.</p>



<p>She didn’t know how to hold the controller until a few hours ago, but now she has already improved enough to talk with me while still playing the game. However, the fact that her opponent, which is me, sucks at it is also a big reason.</p>



<p>“Your food was delicious. It was excellent.”</p>



<p>At that moment, the character that Arisa was operating made a strange movement.</p>



<p>It seems that she pressed the wrong button.</p>



<p>“Is that so.”</p>



<p>Arisa replies with a flat voice.</p>



<p>&#8230;Suddenly my mind conjures up the image of “Shy” Arisa, who was surprised by a mere compliment on her cooking previously.</p>



<p>(&#8230;Isn’t this my win?)</p>



<p>After a series of losses, Yuzuru decided it was time for a Win and decided to engage in psychological warfare.</p>



<p>“The meat and potato stew was delicious. It had just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness, as well as flavor and richness. I wonder if the bonito broth did the work?”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s the season when new potatoes and onions are delicious.”</p>



<p>“The miso soup you made was excellent. The balance between the ingredients and the soup stock was just right. The place where the soup stock is taken from dried bonito and kelp is amazing. The recent granule soup stock is well made, and when a bad guy tries to get it right, it doesn&#8217;t taste good as it should. &#8230;Of course, when a good person takes the soup stock properly, it&#8217;s completely different. Also, this is my personal preference &#8230; Oh! &#8220;</p>



<p>Yuzuru, who lacked concentration because he was thinking of words to compliment Arisa&#8217;s cooking, ate the special move of Arisa&#8217;s character and was defeated brilliantly.</p>



<p>“This is what it means to be drowning in tactics.”</p>



<p>“Did you notice?”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s too blatantly flattering. It&#8217;s generally too abrupt. And it was too deliberate.”</p>



<p>That’s exactly right.</p>



<p>However, some parts need to be corrected.</p>



<p>“I indeed exaggerated it, and it may look flattering, but it was true that the food was delicious. And the taste feedback too.”</p>



<p>“Is that so. Well, I&#8217;m pretty good at cooking. So it can’t be bad.”</p>



<p>Does that mean the same move won&#8217;t work on her over and over again? She doesn&#8217;t seem particularly upset by my praise, but smiles as usual.</p>



<p>Because it was good timing, I decided to proceed to converse with her on the topic of cooking.</p>



<p>“Do you like cooking?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s not the case. I’m just used to it. Well, indeed, I usually cook at home.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, that’s amazing. The person who gets to eat your food is truly blessed.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Is that so?”</p>



<p>Then, Arisa gave a small smile.</p>



<p>It was a sarcastic smile as if to mock herself, slightly different than a shy smile.</p>



<p>“It’s worth making if I can get a compliment on my cooking like Taksegawa-san, even if it’s flattering.”</p>



<p>“It’s not flattery. Your food was delicious. I can’t wait to try it again.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>



<p>Then Arisa turned towards me.</p>



<p>Sitting upright, with a straightened spine and &#8230;&#8230; a reformed expression, jade-colored eyes covered with long eyelashes looking at me.</p>



<p>Unintentionally, I also straightened my posture.</p>



<p>“What happened?”</p>



<p>“Then, What do you want to eat today?”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“I was treated to a cake, so I can make you &#8230;&#8230; if you want. If you don&#8217;t want to, that&#8217;s fine.”</p>



<p>It was an unexpected proposal.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Around 5:30.</p>



<p>White Rice.</p>



<p>Miso soup with Green Onions and Tofu.</p>



<p>Japanese-style hamburger steak (grated radish, roasted mushrooms, boiled broccoli).</p>



<p>Boiled root vegetables.</p>



<p>Spinach sardines.</p>



<p>Egg Rolls.</p>



<p>Cold Tofu.</p>



<p>And the meal was even more sumptuous than I had imagined.</p>



<p>There are two more dishes than when Arisa made for me before.</p>



<p>“By the way, &#8230;you said you usually make at least four side dishes, right?”</p>



<p>I muttered.</p>



<p>Her words at that time were not a lie, but rather, she would usually make a soup and three vegetables plus a few more dishes.</p>



<p>I was amazed by it, but Arisa looked indifferent.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not a big deal. I just bought some tofu and served it.”</p>



<p>Even without it, there are four side dishes.</p>



<p>When it comes to making this regularly&#8230; isn&#8217;t it a lot of hard work?</p>



<p>However, I didn’t say anything about it.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry to have you make me such gorgeous, delicious-looking foods.”</p>



<p>“It’s my Thank You for the cake and the game. The cost of the ingredients is split, and I&#8217;ll be able to eat it too, and I usually make it &#8230;&#8230;, so it&#8217;s nothing to worry about.”</p>



<p>“No,&#8230;the cake and the game are just a Thank You for caring for me, so I&#8217;m in trouble if it&#8217;s returned.”</p>



<p>I replied with a bitter smile.</p>



<p>I feel that various things have become irrelevant due to the exchange of lending and borrowing.</p>



<p>“By the way, you usually cook at home, don&#8217;t you? &#8230;So, is your family&#8217;s dinner okay?”</p>



<p>I suddenly asked because I was concerned about her.</p>



<p>Arisa has already informed her adoptive parents that she will prepare Supper for me and eat with me.</p>



<p>I wanted to eat Arisa’s food again, and indulge in the flavor. &#8230;But, I was worried that her adoptive parents will get angry at her.</p>



<p>“When I told them that I want to give Takasegawa-san home-cooked meal, they ordered me to capture both your heart and stomach. Do they want betrothal money so badly?”</p>



<p>She said so, while laughing with the corners of her mouth raised slightly, and snorting with her small nose.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s that kind of smile, both self-mocking and somewhat belittling.</p>



<p>“I don’t know about my heart, but my stomach is already captured.”</p>



<p>“You’re good at joking.”</p>



<p>“No, it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;ve been suffering from Yukishiro withdrawal for a while.”</p>



<p>“It’s a bad joke. &#8230;Let’s eat quickly. It will get cold.”</p>



<p>She said this in a cold voice, with an amused look on her face.</p>



<p>The air cooled even before the food.</p>



<p>I clasped my hands together and then took the chopsticks.</p>



<p>For now, I take a sip of the miso soup.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s delicious this time too.”</p>



<p>“Well, I haven&#8217;t changed the way it&#8217;s made. Naturally, it tastes the same.”</p>



<p>“The fact that it tastes consistently good shows that you&#8217;re a good cook, doesn&#8217;t it?”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s too flattering. But it doesn&#8217;t matter, as long as you remember the amount.”</p>



<p>Arisa replied matter-of-factly. Yuzuru decided that piling on the words would only make it seem more frivolous, so he stopped giving detailed feedback on the taste of Arisa&#8217;s food.</p>



<p>Yuzuru moves the chopsticks, thinking that it is delicious, even if he doesn&#8217;t say anything.</p>



<p>Then&#8230;</p>



<p>“&#8230;Was it so delicious?”</p>



<p>After eating halfway through, Arisa asked.</p>



<p>I wondered why she would ask such a thing now.</p>



<p>“Didn’t I tell you that earlier?”</p>



<p>“No,&#8230;you looked like you were enjoying eating my food, so.”</p>



<p>After saying that, Arisa turned her eyes to my plate, where most of the dishes had disappeared.</p>



<p>Then she asked me with her calm voice.</p>



<p>“Do you want a refill? There are still some hamburgers, stewed vegetables and miso soup left, though.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I would love to have it.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.”</p>



<p>Arisa received the empty plate from me and stood up.</p>



<p>Then she turns her back to me and headed to the kitchen.</p>



<p>I can’t confirm her expression, but…</p>



<p>I was convinced, she understood that this time it wasn’t flattery.</p>
