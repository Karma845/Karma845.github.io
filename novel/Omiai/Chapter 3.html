<h3>Chapter 3 - Somehow Engaged</h3>

<p>“What did they say? Yuzuru”</p>



<p>“I have to use crutches for at least a week. And It will take half a month to fully recover”</p>



<p>Yuzuru replied to his Grandfather, who didn’t seem to be too worried.</p>



<p>And thus he inwardly grumbles, “That cat….. , next time I see you, I will definitely take take care of you”</p>



<p>“Oh! Takasegawa-San”</p>



<p>Arisa and her adoptive parents approached Yuzuru with changing color on their face.</p>



<p>Even if they are called adoptive parents they haven’t finished adoption procedure yet, that’s why Arisa and they have different surnames.</p>



<p>While Arisa is “Yukishiro”, they are “Amagi”.</p>



<p>I’ve heard they are family from good lineage, also in recent years they seem to be suffering from difficult financial condition.</p>



<p>That’s why Amagi couple faces looked so pale.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Arisa had a frightened and tearful expression, which I think nobody has seen it in school.</p>



<p>And they looked totally exhausted.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, this child …&#8230;instigated something strange”</p>



<p>“We’ll pay the treatment fee and compensation fees, so……”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry……”</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s adoptive parents hold down Arisa&#8217;s head and forced her to bow.</p>



<p>That action &#8211; consciously or unconsciously, I don&#8217;t know &#8211; was somewhat violent, and it looked as if he was hitting her head from above.</p>



<p>The Amagi couple and Arisa desperately apologized, to which Yuzuru&#8217;s grandfather and father reply nonchalantly.</p>



<p>“No, It’s fine…&#8230;It was this stupid guys fault to climb the tree and fall”</p>



<p>“In the first place, it was this child who climbed the tree without permission.”</p>



<p>They proclaim that they don’t need treatment and compensation fee.</p>



<p>In fact, Yuzuru climbed up and fell on his own, so Arisa has no fault.</p>



<p>“Please raise your heads. It was my fault to climb the tree. In addition……”</p>


<p>Suddenly, Yuzuru realized.</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s cheeks were slightly swollen.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230; It seems her relationship with her adoptive parents isn&#8217;t going well, Yuzuru speculates.</p>



<p>“I just felt like showing off in front of the person I love. Oh no, it&#8217;s embarrassing &#8230;…”</p>

<p>I like her, Yuzuru clearly stated. At this, Yuzuru’s Grandparents, Arisa’s adoptive parents and Arisa herself were totally baffled.</p>



<p>“Will you &#8220;Engage&#8221; me? Yukishiro, no &#8230; Arisa”</p>



<p>Of course, It’s a fake &#8216;Engagement&#8217;.</p>



<p>It seems that the intention was properly transmitted to Airisa.</p>



<p>Arisa nodded a little, dyeing her cheeks slightly red.</p>



<p>“I will gladly &#8230;&#8230; &#8216;Engage&#8217; you. Takasegawa-san &#8230;&#8230; No, Yuzuru-san”</p>



<p>Thus, we are now happily engaged.</p>



<p>After that, Yuzuru took Arisa out for a private conversation.</p>



<p>The sun is setting and the sky is dyed with deep red.</p>



<p>Yuzuru tried to sit on a bench outdoors, but with &#8230;&#8230; crutches, he couldn’t sit properly.</p>



<p>Somehow I was able to sit down with the help of Arisa.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry”</p>



<p>Arisa said in a slightly tearful voice.</p>



<p>The sunset illuminates her flax-colored hair, making it shine in golden.</p>



<p>However, despite its beautiful appearance, &#8230;&#8230; It somehow gave me a sense of transience, as if it could disappear at any moment.</p>



<p>“Why are you apologizing&#8221;</p>



<p>“…&#8230;I am sorry for the trouble I have caused you”</p>



<p>“It was my own fault for falling from the tree……”</p>



<p>“It’s, It’s not…&#8230;that, It’s about “Engagement”. You covered for me, didn&#8217;t you? When it comes to the calling off engagement, It was my action that caused all this to happen. You propose “Engagement” because you realize my situation with Amagi family, right?”</p>



<p>Considering the explanation of Arisa’s “My Adoptive father was the most excited” and the rumor that they are in dire financial situation, it seems like they are after the betrothal-money.</p>



<p>Yuzuru realized if he didn’t help her now, her relationship with adoptive parents may  worsened.</p>



<p>“In the first place, it was my own fault to fall from the tree. And It made story more complicated. So there&#8217;s no need for you to be bothered or indebted to me&#8230;…”</p>



<p>“Even then. That was a really big help. At that rate, I might have been forced to marry someone I didn&#8217;t like. I really, don&#8217;t want to be married to someone who are only after my body in exchange for money!”</p>



<p>Arisa said that while hugging her shaking body.</p>



<p>Then she looked at Yuzuru with a faint smile.</p>



<p>“Takasegawa-san, you are my benefactor. For now, I am safe from troubles”</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t really put my head into the others family problems. However, we are classmates. So if you have any problems, please contact me. I will help you as much as possible”</p>



<p>Yuzuru, who sympathized with her circumstances, promised that, even though he finds it a rather unreliable statement.</p>



<p>Unless they are violating the law, they will simply refuse saying, “Stay out of the family affairs”.</p>



<p>A poor attempt to stir things up could make Arisa&#8217;s position even worse.</p>



<p>Arisa isn’t stupid either, knows its just a verbal promise.</p>



<p>However……</p>



<p>“It’s really, really encouraging just to hear that”</p>



<p>Her Jade-colored eyes were moist as she said this with such an expression that looked relieved and somewhat saved.</p>



<p>Three days later, after the end of Golden Week.</p>



<p>Yuzuru decided to return to his apartment.</p>



<p>My parents and grandparents were trying to stop me from going back,&#8230;&#8230; it will probably take one hour to reach my apartment from here.</p>



<p>It will be time consuming to pick up and drop off by a car.</p>



<p>I was a little loss……, but Yuzuru who didn’t want to get up early in the morning, decided to return to his apartment.</p>



<p>(I guess I&#8217;ll have to take a break from my part-time job. But &#8230;&#8230; I think an inconvenient life is about to begin.)</p>



<p>Early in the morning on the first day of school, Yuzuru opened the door of his apartment building, sticking out his cane, trying his best to go to school.</p>



<p>Then there……</p>



<p>“Good morning, Takasegawa-san”</p>



<p>“…&#8230;Why are you here?”</p>



<p>A beautiful girl with light brown hair and green eyes.</p>



<p>Arisa Yukishiro stood.</p>



<p>She said with her usual calm expression, but in a determined voice, with a strong will in her beautiful eyes.</p>



<p>“I will support Takasegawa-san until you are fully healed”</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hassle&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;, said Yuzuru while trying to scratch his head, he released the crutches which caused him to staggered greatly. </p>
