<h3>Chapter 1 - The Classmate Where She Put Unreasonable Condition</h3>

<p>In the rooftop of a certain high school.</p>



<p>After school.</p>



<p>In that place, which was usually off-limits, two high school boys were chattering,</p>



<p>In first glance, looking at their torn down uniform they don’t seem like well behaved bunch.</p>



<p>“Ha……”</p>



<p>One of them, Yuzuru Takasegawa, a boy with dark hair and blue eyes, took a big sigh.</p>



<p>He had a severe, languid look.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong Yuzuru? suddenly sighing.”</p>



<p>“Listen”</p>



<p>Yuzuru begins to complain to the boy next to him, Soichiro Satake.</p>



<p>“Recently, the age of marriage has reached 15 for both men and women, right?”</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s right. &#8230;&#8230; What happened to that?”</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the reason why …&#8230;my grandfather and grandmother have been pestering me since I graduated from middle school, asking me to marry……and to go to bind dates!”</p>



<p>At every opportunity, they ask Yuzuru, “Did you get yourself a Girlfriend?” “Do you have someone you like?”, And at the end of the story, they setup a matchmaking proposal or proceed with the matchmaking process without my permission.</p>



<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not interested in the matchmaking that went on without my knowledge, so from the beginning I am firmly refusing it but……</p>



<p>“But you are still not yet fifteen, right? There is a limit for being hasty…&#8230;but why are they doing such thing though?”</p>



<p>“They want to see the face of their Great-Grandson”</p>



<p>“It’s…&#8230;true, they can’t see it unless you get married early”</p>



<p>Soichiro starts laughing loudly.</p>



<p>From Yuzuru’s point of view, it’s not a laughing matter.</p>



<p>Yuzuru doesn&#8217;t usually meet his grandparents because he lives alone, but he can&#8217;t help but meet them when he returns to his parents&#8217; house.</p>



<p>They will definitely talk about it during the holidays in early May, and they may force me to go on a blind date.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m not in love with anyone, nor have I fallen in love,but…&#8230;when I want to get in a relationship, my fiancee will get in the way, and and it&#8217;s a waste of time to go on an blind date when I don&#8217;t have any intention of getting engaged…&#8230;how can I avoid it somehow?”</p>



<p>“Then…&#8230;why don’t you try to put out a unreasonable condition?”</p>



<p>“Unreasonable condition?”</p>



<p>“If you want me to go on a blind date, bring me a beautiful girl! Like that”</p>



<p>“It’s…&#8230;yeah, that’s a good idea.What exactly is the…&#8230;unreasonable condition though?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, like blonde hair and blue eyes? Your grandfather wouldn&#8217;t be prepared either, would he?”</p>



<p>“No, Grandpa might bring them in from abroad. He  has connections in abroad.”<br><br>It may be a lot harder than looking for it in Japan, but let&#8217;s not underestimate the old people who want to see their great-grandchildren.</p>



<p>“What if condition is Japanese fluency? The language barrier will be a hassle, so the person should be a Japanese or at least fluent in Japanese language. If you narrow it down this far, it won&#8217;t be easy for them.”</p>



<p>“Certainly &#8230;&#8230; Well, if you&#8217;re going to have a wife, you&#8217;re going to limit it to the person who have a certain amount of identity. And when it comes to being fluent in Japanese, it&#8217;s certainly difficult. &#8230;&#8230; Okay, let&#8217;s go with that.”</p>



<p>At that time, Yuzuru decided to go with that.</p>



<p>Conveniently, his cellphone rang.</p>



<p>“Yes, Hello”</p>



<p>“Yuzuru! During the Golden Week holidays, when you came back &#8230; will you take an arranged marriage meeting? This is a once-in-a-lifetime request. I want to see my great-grandchildren while I&#8217;m still alive&#8230;.…”</p>



<p>“Okay”</p>



<p>“Somehow there…&#8230;eh!?? Is it okay, Yuzuru!”</p>



<p>“However, there are some conditions”</p>



<p>To his grandfather, who was astonished on the other side of the phone, Yuzuru said &#8220;unreasonable conditions&#8221;.</p>



<p>“If it&#8217;s a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, pale girl, I&#8217;d consider an arranged marriage. Oh, of course, she should be the same age as me and has Japanese nationality. It&#8217;s a hassle when there&#8217;s an age or language barrier. Then there&#8217;s &#8230;…”</p>



<p>Yuzuru looks at Soichiro.</p>



<p>Then Soichiro types something into his cell phone and holds it up in front of Yuzuru.</p>



<p>Yuzuru reads aloud the text written there.</p>



<p>“The girl should have big breast and big butt…&#8230;ah, I mean good style. She should be gentle and graceful like Yamato Nadeshiko. And…&#8230;she should be good at cooking, smart and athletic. …&#8230;But there is no way such type of a girl really exists”</p>



<p>When Yuzuru looks at Soichiro with a dumbfounded face, Soichiro cowers his shoulders.</p>



<p>Then, Soichiro types in and shows, “You&#8217;re not there, so it&#8217;s okay, right?”.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s…&#8230;even for me, it’s a bit harsh”</p>



<p>“If it&#8217;s impossible, it&#8217;s okay, right? I don&#8217;t want to trouble you.”</p>



<p>“I understand &#8230; I&#8217;ll look for it until the holidays, so be prepared!”</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay”</p>



<p>Yuzuru hung up looking fed up, wondering what to be prepared for.</p>



<p>And asks Soichiro.</p>



<p>“Do they really want to see their Great-Grandson face that much?”</p>



<p>“I don’t know? I will not understand it until I get older……By the way, aren&#8217;t you familiar with the girl who fits those criteria”</p>



<p>“Familiar?”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s Yukishiro. Your classmate Arisa Yukishiro”</p>



<p>Arisa Yukishiro.</p>



<p>She is pretty famous in our school and female classmate.</p>



<p>She has a beautiful green eyes with lightly pigmented brown (flax) hair.</p>



<p>Her skin is as beautiful as snow women and as smooth as porcelain.</p>



<p>Her body is slender, but on closer inspection, she has a well-built body.</p>



<p>She has an atmosphere surrounding her that wants to keep people away.</p>



<p>Such a girl.</p>



<p>Because she is a mysterious, picturesque beauty, the boys look at her with desire, and I hear that she is often confessed to.</p>



<p>And I don&#8217;t hear any floating stories at all, so I think they&#8217;re all turn down.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not blue-eyed, though, it&#8217;s green-eyed. Her hair is also more of a light colored brown hair than a blonde. I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s a good cook, or a Yamato Nadeshiko……”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we are not close enough as to know each other&#8217;s personalities.</p>



<p>I have only exchange light greetings until know, I don’t know if she is aware of my existence.</p>



<p>“It would be interesting if Arisa Yukishiro came”</p>



<p>Soichiro said in a half-joking tone.</p>



<p>However, aside from the subtle differences in hair and eye color, personality and domestic skills, she is the person who best fits the criteria given by Yuzuru, so its not impossible.</p>



<p>“Even if he says to search for it, I don’t think he post an ad on the newspaper, he will probably look for a girl around my age from among his contacts, And whether or not he can find Yukishiro from among his contact. Further…&#8230;Do you really think Yukishiro will agree to go on blind date with me? If that person doesn’t show any interest in arranged marriage, the matchmaking won’t start”</p>



<p>“Well, it&#8217;s funny that you&#8217;re going to a blind date at your age in the first place.”</p>



<p>“Right?”</p>



<p>I’m not an aristocrat and samurai from the past.</p>



<p>In the first place, Yuzuru thought that it was doubtful whether they can find the “girl”.</p>



<p>“Well then, tentatively. What would you do if Arisa Yukishiro came? Do you accept it? Well she is a beautiful girl”</p>



<p>Indeed, for students who fall in love with Arisa Yukishiro and those who have already been sunk, it will be a coveted development such as a matchmaking with Arisa Yukishiro.</p>



<p>But for Yuzuru ……</p>



<p>“I think she&#8217;s beautiful, but I don&#8217;t really like her. I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s a bad girl, but she&#8217;s kind of cold or &#8230;&#8230; not my favorite type of girl. At least, I wouldn&#8217;t want to marry her.”</p>



<p>Arisa Yukishiro is not bad at expressing emotions, and her emotions aren’t weak ……</p>



<p>It seems like she doesn’t want to have any relationship with other people.</p>



<p>She has no intention of making best friend or lover, And keeps an appropriate distance so as not to leave the class circle.</p>



<p>That is my impression about her.</p>



<p>“Also, that girls…&#8230;Isn’t her eyes looks like dead a little? Her eyes are beautiful, it’s just like there is no emotion”</p>



<p>A lake that is too pure where there isn’t a single fish that lives in it.</p>



<p>Arisa’s eyes are of such color.</p>



<p>Soichiro seemed to agree with Yuzuru&#8217;s impression of Arisa, and nodded.</p>



<p>“That being said, I agree. And if you are going to spend the rest of your life with someone who is &#8230;&#8230; going to be a lifelong partner, it&#8217;s safer to choose him or her based on personality than on face.The most important thing is compatibilty”</p>



<p>Yuzuru also agrees.</p>



<p>“Yes, it&#8217;s important to have fun together. Arisa Yukishiro is like &#8230; a decoration”</p>



<p>If you just look at it, it will be good eye candy.</p>



<p>In fact, sometimes Yuzuru also looks at her without being noticed.</p>



<p>If looked at such a beautiful girl, you will be healed just by looking at it little.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m kidding, I don&#8217;t think I can understand.She’s going to look at you with straight face and cold eyes…&#8230;No, that’s what it’s all about”</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s disgusting, dude. &#8230;&#8230; Well, but I kind of get it”</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Soichiro burst into laughter.</p>



<p>…&#8230;Yuzuru didn’t know at that time yet.</p>



<p>The old man’s obsession to see the face of his Great-Grandson.</p>



<p>Then for a while.</p>



<p>The second half of the long holidays in early May-Golden Week.</p>



<p>In a restaurant somewhere in Tokyo.</p>



<p>A girl with flaxen hair was sitting upright in front of Yuzuru wearing a kimono.</p>



<p>She was wearing a kimono with a beautiful hydrangea drawn on it.</p>



<p>Her skin is clear and white, and her eyes and nose are very well balanced.</p>



<p>The girl with immense beauty, turned her green eyes toward Yuzuru, then touched the tatami mats and bowed.</p>



<p>“&#8221;I&#8217;m Arisa Yukishiro. Nice to meet you ……well, it&#8217;s not our first time meeting, right?.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said so while staring at me with her eyes, which were pure but dull.</p>



<p>(……How did this happen)</p>



<p>Yuzuru inwardly held his head in his hands.</p>
