<h3>Chapter 13 - Takesagawa</h3>

<p>"What do you want? Senpai"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>I calm and Arisa was a little cold.</p><p>I confronted Umihara.</p><p>The people around me spread their lunch boxes and chatted with each other ...</p>It seemed that they don't care much about it.</p>"&#8230;&#8230;The other.</p>
Umihara said so.</p>Then he regretfully distorted his expression with humiliation.</p>"We apologize for the inconvenience caused to Takasegawa-san and Yukishiro-san."</p>Saying that, he bowed his head.</p>It seemed that the people around me were surprised.</p>The students, who seemed uninterested at first, turned their eyes to us as if they were curious.</p>(...... This is a public execution.)</p>Well, of course ... I didn't care about the feelings of Umihara.</p>However, I didn't want to stand out because I didn't want to be resented by this.</p>"Raise your head, senpai. I don't care."</p>When I looked at Arisa.</p>She ... had a disgusted look on her face.</p>However, with me and the eyes of the surroundings, she finally returned to herself.</p>"I don't care either"</p>Arisa replied plain.</p>"..."</p>On the other hand, Umihara did not seem to be very convinced.</p>The act of bowing to the first grade seems to have hurt his pride.</p>Perhaps because of that, like a loss at the end ...</p>"... Don't get sick because your house is a little rich."</p>He threw it away against me and left.</p>It was a wonderful boomerang.</p>That ruined the apology.</p>"Hey, Yukishiro. Did you report him to your father?"</p>"No way! ... I don't want to be involved again. What about Takasegawa-san?"</p>"I don't have to rely on my parents for this. I haven't said that.."</p>Neither me nor Arisa reported this to their parents.</p>So why did he suddenly feel like apologizing?</p>U tilted my head inwardly.</p>afterwards.</p>During lunch, when I talking to Sei with Soichiro about what happened earlier ...</p>"Hey, did that person come to apologize to you too?"</p>Soichiro asked astonishingly.</p>Apparently, Umihara also went to apologize to Soichiro.</p>"Did you report to your parents?"</p>"No way. But ... Ayaka and Chiharu seemed to be quite angry. They seemed to be in full swing and told me. That's why Umihara seems to have been angry with his father.</p>When Soichiro said so, Sei showed a frightened tone.</p>"Oh ... women are unforgiving. If you're a man, it's a pity to rely on your parents."</p>"The theory is that he's not a man. Well ... a man or something before that, it's pitiful to bring out his father every time something happens."</p>Soichiro criticized Umihara.</p>From Soichiro's point of view, Umihara is a man who tried to hurt his important childhood friend, so its evaluation was natural.</p>"Hmm, did Ayaka and Chiharu talk about it to the parents ?"</p>"I'll ask them, but ... I don't think that's the case. The two are sensible in that area."</p>The situation with me and Arisa and, Ayaka and Chiharu were two different matters.</p>It is not reasonable for Ayaka and Chiharu to report to their own parents, including mine and Arisa's story.</p>"think Umihara cried out to Dad. "He said he was bullied by a guy named 'Takasegawa'!That's right. And he got scolded for it, right?"</p>"Or maybe Umihara's father asked him. Umihara is that of a jerk, but I hear that father Umihara is a sensible person. he was asked that he might have forced other girls ... Then the name came out. "</p>In any case, Umihara could not have apologized for himself.</p>There is no doubt that Umihara's father was informed that he tried to hurt Arisa for some reason and quarreled with me in the process.</p>"Well ... it's enough. Let's stop."</p>It was unpleasant just to think about Umihara, so I&nbsp; suggested that.</p>Soichiro and Sei noded to agree.</p>"That's right .... I'm sure he've reflected on this."</p>"Well, I don't think a guy who reflects on this level will be a verbal demon. Well, it doesn't matter to me."</p>In this way, the problem surrounding the "verbal demon" was solved for the time being.</p>Well, the latest Saturday.</p>As usual, I was spending time with Arisa.</p>During the supper, I casually asked Arisa.</p>"Is there anything you don't like?"</p>"... Yes? What happened suddenly?"</p>Mysteriously, Arisa asked, with a dismayed expression.</p>Though I thought it was not good to talk to Arisa like this ... I was really worried.</p>"No ... there was Umihara before..."</p>"Ah ... that strange person. Did he do anything?"</p>"No, I have nothing to do with it after that. But ... I was told? I'm rich, so ..."</p>In the first place, there is no reason to be told by a person who brings up his father's profession.</p>However, I am worried about what I really care about.</p>"... Did it worry you ?"</p>Arisa crackled her green eyes and said with a little surprise.</p>I involuntarily scratched my hair.</p>"No, well ... I'm always worried about it, rather than being told by Umihara."</p>The Takasegawa family is not an ordinary house.</p>It's safe to say that it's prestigious.</p>That's why Umihara apologized to me because it also made a considerable amount of political contributions.</p>"That's right. Well, I had the impression that the sense of money seems to be rough."</p>"&#8230;&#8230;how so?"</p>"Piled up games that you don't play, or buy kitchen utensils that you don't use."</p>"... Well, that's right."</p>"But there are a lot of people like that in ordinary households. I don't think it's because Takasegawa is rich. It's a more fundamental problem."</p>"..."</p>Is it really comforting?</p>Or are you preaching?</p>I had a slightly complicated feeling.</p>"But I don't find it annoying. For now ... I didn't know that Takasegawa was such a great house in the first place."</p>"&#8230;&#8230;is that so?"</p>"Yes. You're worrying about it too much. He was just a sore loser. In short, he was just saying that in frustration because he stupidly failed when he tried to mount his own family, financial power, or his father's occupation. You shouldn't pay attention to words from someone like that."</p>Of course, I knew what she was talking about.</p>As a matter of fact, I did't care what the Umihara thought.</p>But ... for Me, the family name of "Takasegawa" is very heavy.</p>"Rather, it's surprising."</p>"surprising?"</p>"Takasegawa-san ... is a really strong person."</p>Arisa's words, were surprising to Me.</p>I never thought I was stronger</p>"&#8230;&#8230;why?"</p>"No, because ... even if he was intimidated, Takasegawa-san wasn't moving at all .... I thought he was a little scared."</p>"Well ... he's not scary."</p>I knew that there were way more scary people in the world.</p>As the next generation of Takasegawa, such human beings are being seen up close.</p>That's why even if I'm just a second-year high school kid, I'm not afraid of the Umihara.</p>However&#8230;&#8230;</p>"That's because it's a family where Umihara can't get his hands on ..."</p>So I wasn't afraid that Umihara brought out a "house."</p>Or maybe, that's why I wasn't scared.</p>The family name "Takasegawa" is more compatible&nbsp; know with family like Umihara than ordinary people.</p>I sighted unintentionally.</p>"If I weren't Takasegawa, he wouldn't have apologized to me. In other words, I'm not strong, but Takasegawa is strong ..."</p>I didn't mean to rely on my house.</p>However, for me, the family name "Takasegawa" is inseparable, and the family name flickers behind the words and actions.</p>In a sense, I was spitting out something that can't be said to Soichiro and his friends.</p>"Does Mr. Takasegawa hate his parents' house?"</p>Arisa asked such a thing.</p>I tilted his head.</p>"No way ... I don't hate it, but I'm proud."</p>"Then, isn't it good?"</p>Then Arisa frowned beautifully.</p>Then choose the words.</p>"What should I say ... After all, the name, appearance, talent, and education are all things that most people got from their parents. So ... Takasegawa's I think are good with power. What is important is how they use it ... "</p>And Arisa puts together the words with strong tone, "Anyway."</p>"I was helped by Takasegawa-san. This is thanks to Takasegawa-san and Yuzuru Takasegawa-san."</p>I felt my heart-throbbing.</p>It felt like the small bones that have been stuck in my throat for many years have been removed.</p>"Yukishiro"</p>"Yes?"</p>"Thank you"</p>"I'm really happy that you helped me."</p>Arisa smiled when she said that.</p>It was very beautiful ... a very natural smile.</p>Mysteriously, my chest screamed.</p>
