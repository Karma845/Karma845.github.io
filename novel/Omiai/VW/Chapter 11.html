<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Fiancée and Branded Items</h3>
	
	<p class="block_6">After finishing their meal, Yuzuru and Arisa split up with Hijiri and Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After seeing them off, …… Arisa muttered to herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“They backed off so easily.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I guess so. Well, both of them understood pretty quickly, which helped a little.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The only clear thing was that Yuzuru and Arisa were not lovers.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, they seemed to have a hunch that we were not just friends, but Yuzuru was very grateful that they did not pry from that point.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But, Yuzuru-san. ……You’ve <span class="calibre5">told Satake</span>-san, but not Ryozenji-san. Is that okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you talking about our friendships?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“He wouldn’t make a fuss about something like that. Well, I do feel bad about that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both Hijiri and Soichiro are equal friends to Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If so, it makes sense to talk to Hijiri as he talked to Soichiro. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, you never know where information will leak from, so if you can keep it secret, it is safer to keep it secret.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the case of Soichiro, they were in a swimsuit in a swimming pool, a situation that could not be excused.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And there was Ayaka, who was very intuitive and perceptive.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In contrast, this time, to some extent, the deception was effective.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve known him for a long time, so I can trust him. But I don’t know anything about Nagiri-san’s personality.’</p>
	<p class="block_7">Not only was Hijiri there, but Tenka was there as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru can vouch for Hijiri’s character, but not so much for Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“Nagiri-san didn’t seem like a bad person, though…… Her character isn’t very good, however.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, she was a little upset about being laughed at so much.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa arched her beautiful eyebrows.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru chuckled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well,…… unless both sides are deemed to be credible, the policy of keeping it under wraps is probably safe. By the way, if I get pursued by the Hijiri at a later date, and if there is no way to cover it up……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yuzuru-san trusts Ryozenji-san, right? Then it’s okay. I can’t trust Ryozenji-san, but I can trust you, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you for saying so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, she trusts Yuzuru’s eyes to see people, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But more than that, she probably worries about Yuzuru’s relationships.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps she was worried that Yuzuru’s friendships would be destroyed in order to protect her, but even so, he was grateful for Arisa’s thoughtfulness.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be too tasteless to just say “yes, goodbye” there, so Yuzuru and Arisa decided to take a look around the nearby shopping mall.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yuzuru-san, is there anything you want to see or buy? I’m thinking of buying some autumn clothes …… and a coat if my budget is sufficient.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right……. I want to buy some accessories.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru replied that, Arisa’s eyes widened, a little unexpectedly.</p>
	
	<p class="block_7">It wasn’t that he didn’t care about his clothes, but it was surprising that Yuzuru, who didn’t seem to like fashion, would want something like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru also had his own thoughts, and feeling a little embarrassed, said deceptively.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, see, ……, you’re trendy, aren’t you? As long as we are walking side by side, I have to raise my level. I thought it would be rude of me not to.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s a good mindset.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps she was pleased by Yuzuru’s words, Arisa said in good spirits.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru chuckled at the joking, but somewhat pompous tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Who are you exactly to be high and mighty?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Fiancée-sama, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, of course, you were… Arisa-sama.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since Yuzuru had already decided what he wanted to buy, the two of them headed for the area where watches, jewelry, and other precious metals were sold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There is a wide range of precious metals.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What Yuzuru wanted to buy was something cheap that a high school student would feel comfortable wearing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What kind of items do you want to buy?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I guess. Well, I have a watch on my wrist, so I guess I’ll go for something for my neck ……. I think the price should not exceed 10,000 yen.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru answered, Arisa pointed to a corner of the store.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How about that? I think it’s cool.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I like the simplicity of it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What Arisa found was a simple necklace made of black spinel, a black gemstone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The price is about three thousand yen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s relatively affordable, and a high school student can wear it without feeling out of place.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After getting permission from the clerk, Yuzuru took the black spinel in his hand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He held it up to his neck and asked Arisa to take a look.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It looks good on you. …… You looks a little sexier.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said while slightly lowering her jade green eyes covered with beautiful eyelashes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that she was not saying it as flattery.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sexier, huh? ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What exactly does it mean for a man to be sexy?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t quite understand why he was even sexy in the first place. …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">Believing Arisa’s words, he decided to buy it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Um, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What is it, Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… You can’t wear that necklace unless you’re with me. Also, you can’t wear it to school.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Huh. …… Well, that’s fine. Why?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru tilted his head, wondering why she said such a strange thing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa’s skin turned slightly rosy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If Yuzuru-san becomes popular with girls, I will be in trouble. Even though it’s …… fake, I’m Yuzuru-san’s fiancée.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re exaggerating. You know that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m not exaggerating……. Besides, I’m the one who chose it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Absolutely not!</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa glared at Yuzuru, as if to say that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her well-formed eyebrows are drawn together, her emerald eyes are lifted, and her mouth is bent into a curve.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“All right, I promise.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was a little puzzled by Arisa’s strange possessiveness, but he replied.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, since they were in the accessories area, they looked around at the women’s ornaments as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“It’s beautiful, isn’t it…… that jewelry?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">With an enraptured expression, Arisa looked at the beautiful emeralds.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although Arisa is a little out of touch with the rest of the world, she seems to like this kind of jewelry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“They are, like your eyes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru jokingly said as Arisa looked at the emerald.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa smacked Yuzuru on the chest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Please stop doing that! We look like an idiot couple.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s face turned bright red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru also scratched his cheek, feeling his face getting a little hot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …… after I said that, I thought it was too cheesy.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Totally, ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa seemed to be trying to say she was angry, but her mouth was a little loose.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seems to like this kind of cheesy dialogue.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“By the way, ……, what do you think about this one? Let me know for future reference.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, sure.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Walking around the store, Arisa evaluates each piece of jewelry, saying “I like this one” or “This is not my taste”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seemed to like both the cute designs as well as the gorgeous and flashy ones.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And they all have one thing in common: they are expensive.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, if it has a good design or uses high-quality stones, it will naturally be more expensive, which is a sign that Arisa has a good eye for appraisal. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a surprising discovery for Yuzuru that Arisa, who was rather frugal when it came to shopping at the supermarket, preferred to buy something that looked reasonably expensive.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(I mean, normally she’s repressed in many ways and doesn’t get this kind of thing at all……But she really wanted this kind of thing huh.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">His tear glands welled up a little.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t know much about jewelers and their names. …… Do you know about them, Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, not really. I know about as much as anyone.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What are some of the most famous ones?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Tiffany, Cartier, Bvlgari, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, and Harry Winston are the five most famous jewelers.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Brand names seems to have been modified</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Wow.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said the names effortlessly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of the five, Yuzuru only knew about Tiffany and Harry Winston.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa named several other brands.</p>
	
	<p class="block_7">She knows more than he thought she would.</p>
	<p class="block_9"><span class="text_2">“In Japan, it’s 4</span><span class="text_3">℃</span><span class="text_2"> or something. …… What’s wrong? Yuzuru-san. You have a strange face.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Remembering that Arisa was the kind of girl who couldn’t even afford (or was too shy to ask for) a little expensive soap, he couldn’t bring himself to say that he felt so sorry for her that he almost cried.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would hurt Arisa’s self-esteem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shouldn’t we go look at some clothes soon?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At least Yuzuru’s business was over.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be Arisa’s turn next, so he suggested,</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. Let’s go see it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa gave a small nod.</p>
