	<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Fiancée and Accident</h3>
	
	
	<p class="block_6">“Well, Niisan. I’m very sorry to bother you in the middle of all this excitement.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru came back to himself when he heard the very apologetic voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa did the same, distancing herself from Yuzuru as if she had bounced.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her face turned red and she cast her head down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, what’s the matter, Ayumi? Do you need something?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The voice belonged to Ayumi Takasegawa, Yuzuru’s younger sister.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not that she was making a mockery of the situation, but that her voice and expression were truly apologetic, which was even more embarrassing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, or more precisely, there’s something I need to tell Arisa-san”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is it for me? Yes, what is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa coughed deliberately and then turned to Ayumi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her expression returned to its usual calm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Her face was still red, though.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s terrible, Arisa-san. The trains have been suspended.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” “What?” “</p>
	<p class="block_7">According to Ayumi’s explanation, there was a minor accident just a few minutes ago.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Fortunately, no one has died. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">The trains seem to have been suspended temporarily because of it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There is no timetable for recovery at this point.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even if it could be restored, it would surely be very crowded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘So, what should I do? Arisa-san. As for me……, I don’t want to send you home in the middle of the night on a crowded train because of all the dangers.’</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s father, Kazuya Takasegawa said to Arisa in a calm but strong tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even with Yuzuru as an escort, a crowded train is dangerous in many ways.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, that’s true ……. But then how do I get home ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think it’s best if we drive you home.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">I feel sorry for the driver at this hour though, Kazuya muttered to himself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, the Takasegawa family hired their own driver.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But the roads are busy now, aren’t they? It will be late.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s <span class="calibre5">mother, Sayori</span><span class="calibre5"> Takasegawa, voiced her concern about the traffic situation on the road.</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Originally, the roads were congested with people who had gathered for this festival.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition to this, there will be an increase in the number of cabs and cars that people have called to take them to and from the festival due to the stoppage of the train. So there is no doubt that the roads will be crowded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But, Mom. She can’t walk home, and we can’t make her take the train home. So a car is the most appropriate option, isn’t it? Right, Arisa.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked Arisa, the person concerned.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She nodded a little.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, if it’s an accident, it can’t be helped. …… I’m sorry to inconvenience Yuzuru-san and the rest of the Takasegawa family, but I would appreciate it if you could drop me off.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Ayumi smirked and chuckled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Huh? You were calling each other by last names just until now, when did you start calling by first names? You two have become very close. You two were hugging as well. So what were you doing?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt his face heat up at Ayumi’s words as she made fun of him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa also turned her face down in embarrassment, as if she remembered her shameful behavior earlier.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is again……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, my.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">“Ara Ara”</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori smiled happily at Kazuya, who laughed bitterly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru deliberately cleared his throat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It doesn’t matter now, does it? It’s more about how Arisa is getting home. If we are going to drive home, we’d better leave early…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve got a great idea, is it okay though?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As if to interrupt Yuzuru’s words, Ayumi said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Everyone’s eyes were drawn to Ayumi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How about staying the night here?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi said, looking pleased with herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru frowned at her, wondering what she was talking about.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, that’s not ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Isn’t it fine.? It’s not like you two are sleeping in the same room. Besides, it’s dangerous to drive late at night, isn’t it? It’s also terrible for the driver. Arisa-san must be tired. Shouldn’t she stay the night and get home in plenty of time?”</p>
	<p>Ayumi’s suggestion seemed to make sense.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If Yuzuru and Arisa were to sleep together alone, it would be a ridiculous situation, but as long as their parents and sister were watching them closely, no mistakes would occur.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the first place, Yuzuru and Arisa are lovers, so even if a mistake occurs, it is not unforgivable ……, with that said, sleeping under the same roof will not be a problem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But what about a change of clothes or something? Arisa only has her casual clothes and a yukata.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He didn’t go into specifics, but as a girl, she wouldn’t want to spend the night in the same underwear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It will be hard to sleep in casual clothes, and yukata is not good if it gets wrinkled. …… But Arisa does not have a nightgown.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“She can just borrow our mother’s nightgown, right? You can get underwear at a convenience store. We have towels and bedding. I’m sure it won’t be a problem for one night.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sure, ……, that’s true, too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru muttered to himself and then looked at Kazuya and Sayori.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Together, they nodded their heads in agreement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t mind it either way.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I want her to stay with us. I want to hear more about Yuzuru from Arisa-chan.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After they had given their permission, Yuzuru looked at Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru then asked Arisa, who had a puzzled expression on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s how it is. If you don’t mind, you’re welcome to stay the night. Don’t think about bothering us or anything, just choose whichever you like. What do you think ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After some thought, Arisa nodded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well then, ……, I’ll be obliged to indulge in your kind words.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Thus, Arisa’s sleepover was confirmed.</p>
