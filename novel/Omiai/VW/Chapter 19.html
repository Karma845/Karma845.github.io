<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Fiancée and Thunder</h3>

	<p class="block_6">Munyu~!</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt something soft pressing against his chest area.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On top of his body, Arisa was shivering and shaking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, hey, Arisa. Are you okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m oka…Kya!!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When the lightning struck again, Arisa’s body shuddered.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At any rate, Yuzuru pulled himself up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa flopped down and sat down as if she had lost her strength.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Are you bad with thunder?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, that was just a surprise. If I am prepared, I am not afraid.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As soon as Arisa said that, lightning struck again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She cowered ….. but did not scream.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And then she looked at Yuzuru as if to say, “See, I’m fine, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is a problem, though. I guess I’ll have to call a cab. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Wait a minute. What if it drops onto the car?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” No……. but I have heard that cars are safe “</p>
	<p class="block_7">From the information he had heard: ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">When lightning strikes a car or a building, it escapes through the surface to the ground.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, the inside is safe.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……If the signal stops or something, it’s dangerous.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm. Well, that may be true.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If the power goes out while you are driving, it might trigger an accident.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The car is also dangerous when you think about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But trains are more dangerous, aren’t they?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s …… well, yes, but ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But indeed, staying over is not……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s it!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru mumbled, Arisa shouted loudly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s eyes widened, wondering what she was talking about.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“eh, ‘ that’s it!’ you say? I mean, ……are you insane?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sane. …… I’m, under no circumstances, returning. I’m not leaving this room.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa declared herself a shut-in.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but scratch his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As expected, it is not good for an unmarried man and woman to spend the night in the same room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You know, …… Arisa. You may have forgotten, but I’m a man, remember? It’s dangerous.”</p>

	<p class="block_7">” When it comes to lightning and Yuzuru-san, lightning is more dangerous. If it is Yuzuru-san, no matter what happens, I will not die.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah ……, that’s, well, true.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that the fear of thunder was causing her to lose her sense of danger and her senses.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, Yuzuru was not going to attack Arisa, so she was safe. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But there are no absolutes in this world.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If there is any kind of ” spur of the moment”, it will be very bad.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t have a change of clothes or a futon for you to use……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I will sleep on the floor. I don’t need a change of clothes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">By the way, there was no futon or bed, but a sleeping bag was available.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a change of clothes, he can lend his school jersey or gym clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then ……it is fine, as long as your guardian gives you permission.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Okay. I’ll call my foster father.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With that, Arisa went to the corner of the room and made a phone call.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After a while, Arisa hung up the phone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How did it go?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I got the permission”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Really…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sighed involuntarily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, if you think about it, Yuzuru and Arisa are supposed to be fiancés and lovers …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">If that’s the case, an overnight stay should be no problem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, that’s assuming that mistakes don’t happen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, ……, can I go take a shower for now?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, yes. Go ahead.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru took a quick shower after asking Arisa’s permission.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After wiping himself off, he changed into a jersey for his sleepwear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Normally he walked around naked because he was alone, but that’s not going to happen today.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After getting dressed, Yuzuru called out to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes……. Hey, that’s a little…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s skin turned vermillion and she looked away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but tilt his head, wondering what was going on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa indicated her chest with her finger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yuzuru-san. Please close that…… properly.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, swimsuits are fine, but these things are still not fine.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru closed his chest area, which was slightly open and showing some skin, tightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, what is it that you wanted?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I thought you might want to take a shower. I can lend you a bath towel and my gym clothes or jersey if you want.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sorry for the trouble. Thank you very much.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa thought for a moment …… and asked Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, well, Yuzuru-san…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” …… What should I do about underwear?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry, but I’m not as prepared as to have brand new women’s underwear.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he did possess one, that would be a tremendous deal, in a different way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, there is always the option of going to a convenience store in the rain to buy one,……, but Yuzuru did not want to do that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s, well, of course, obvious, but I’d like to change it…… if it’s possible……..”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That said, there is nothing we can do about it. You can either keep it on, or you can go without it ……. I’ll leave it to your choice.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru replied that, Arisa looked conflicted.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘I want to change my underwear.’</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘At the very least, I don’t want to wear the same thing all day and into the next morning.’</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘But to go without is indeed ……’</p>
	<p class="block_7">That was the expression on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru would prefer that she keep wearing the same one for his mental stability.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…..I’ll think about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, there was room for thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, as long as he told Arisa that he leaves it to her own free will, there was nothing he could do about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru watched the back of Arisa’s figure as she walked into the changing room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After a while, a slight sound of water began to be heard.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a little awkward.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With that in mind, Yuzuru picked up his smartphone and started playing with it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… And then, suddenly, it happened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In an instant, the place went completely dark.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he heard a scream from the bathroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><br class="calibre7" />“Kyaaaaaah! Help , please help me! Yuzuru-san!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Give me a break!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sighed loudly.</p>
