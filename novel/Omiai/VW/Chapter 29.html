<h3>Chapter 29 &#8211; Thoughts about Fiancée</h3>

	<p class="block_6">“Yuzuru has ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“A bento…..”</p>
	<p class="block_11">Incredible things were seen.</p>
	<p class="block_11">The world might be destroyed tomorrow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two who looked as if they were saying that, were Soichiro and Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Isn’t it fine?. I just brought my own bento.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said as he opened the lunch box he had received from Arisa this morning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was still warm inside because it was of the heat-retaining type.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are two boxes of bento.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One is filled with white rice with pickled plums.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The other is filled with stylish side dishes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As is to be expected with Arisa, there are no frozen foods in it.</p>
	<p class="block_11">…… Is it because she feels like she’s defeated in this too?</p>
	<p class="block_7">At any rate, he took a mouthful of fried chicken.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The taste is not too strong, not too thin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The batter is crispy even though it has been made for a long time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he bit into it, it was more tender than he expected, and the flavor of the meat spread to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(As expected, it is delicious.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru decided that he would tell her tomorrow morning that it was delicious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">By the way, there are three bento boxes in total, and they are rotated every day.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is it from Yukishiro-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Soichiro who made the guess.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Yuzuru lived alone, there was no way he could receive a lunch box from his mother, and then again, there was no way Yuzuru would make one, so it was a natural deduction.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah well.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it was really delicious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s food is exceptionally delicious when freshly prepared, but she also seems to be able to make side dishes that are delicious even when cold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Not only are her dishes delicious, but they are also very colorful and nutritious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was truly mind-boggling.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is it good?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Of course it is.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ……Can I have a taste of it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Give me some as well.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Hijiri wanted to try some.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was torn between wanting to monopolize Arisa’s lunch box and wanting to show off Arisa’s cooking, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">He decided to share a little.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Soichiro, he gave fried chicken.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Hijiri, he gave a rolled egg.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two gave Yuzuru a side dish in return and then took a bite of the side dish that Arisa had made.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s better than I thought it would be.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Hijiri shouted in surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt proud, even though he hadn’t made it himself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s this ?….. Now I’m the only one who has to eat from the School cafeteria?.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro is bringing a bento box that his mother made for him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So far, Yuzuru and Hijiri have been eating lunch in the school cafeteria and Soichiro has been eating lunch alone, but that will end today.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“<span class="calibre5">Still, you’re</span> in high school and you have a loving wife who packs a bento for you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Why don’t you just get married already?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Hijiri said in a tone that was half ridiculous and half-serious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He has already told Hijiri that they are engaged, with Arisa’s permission.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, after the study session and Halloween, Arisa became friends with Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She felt bad about hiding it from her friends, so she decided to tell Hijiri and Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As for Yuzuru, he was a little concerned about hiding it, so it made him feel better.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m paying for the ingredients, though.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t think Yukishiro-san would normally make something with just the cost of ingredients.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If I ask, will Yukishiro make one for me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, that’s impossible.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa is not a bento shop.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s the same amount of effort. That said, the fact that she makes a lunch box with only the cost of the ingredients is because she has a certain amount of affection for Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whether it is friendship or love……It is hard to tell.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Seriously, aren’t you going out with her? …… Well, since you’re engaged, I’d say you’re already dating.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“From what I’ve heard so far, you guys look like a couple of lovebirds. Do you guys have any plans to reach the finish line?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, so that’s what you’re asking.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was not unaware of this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the beginning, they went on dates to “act as fiancé”, but lately they have been enjoying themselves normally.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The same would be true for Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, I do like Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Obviously.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve been thinking about it for a while, but that kind of Western look is right up your alley.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s not just her face, though.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Hijiri said, Arisa’s appearance, including her amazing style, is right up Yuzuru’s alley.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, she has a good personality.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She is kind, caring, and supportive of Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa says she has a bad personality, but …… she is cute in that way as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, she is a good cook.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And above all, as seen from the Halloween incident, she has a surprisingly good sense of humor and can tell jokes. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">&ndash;It’s fun to be with her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s just that……if you’re asking me if I’m in love with her, I’m not sure.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You mean you like her as a friend?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You don’t like her as a person?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I like her as a person of the opposite sex…..But liking her and having strong feelings for her are different things right……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every man has a girl or two that he likes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even men who have wives or girlfriends may not have affairs or cheat on them, but they may still be attracted to a beautiful and kind woman.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“In short. I’m comfortable with the relationship we have now, so I’m not so sure I want to force it to move forward. Most importantly, ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Not all lovers and couples in this world enter into a relationship with a strong desire to be together.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, many of them may have started their relationship ‘just for the sake of it ‘.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So there is nothing strange about Yuzuru becoming lovers with Arisa, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“For my part …… I don’t think it’s wise for me to fall in love with Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa appear to be equals, but in reality, they are not. </p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru can refuse to marry Arisa if he wants to, but Arisa can’t.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The “engagement” between Yuzuru and Arisa is only possible because Yuzuru has no intention of getting married.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, …… for lack of a better word, Yuzuru has the right of life and death over Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So if Yuzuru falls in love with Arisa, that is, if Yuzuru wants to marry her, Arisa can’t refuse it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He explained his idea to Soichiro and Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, that’s how it is. …… So for now, I’ll maintain this relationship. I don’t think I want to force my feelings on her to become my girlfriend.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After saying that, Yuzuru thought of his father’s face.</p>
	<p class="block_11">(My father is a man of means. He probably saw through Arisa’s feeble nature long ago. …… I have to be careful.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya Takasegawa may look mild-mannered at first glance, but he is actually a very calm, cool-headed, and cold-blooded man.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is of course one of the aspects of his professional life, but in his personal life, he is kind to his family. A good father in general, and Yuzuru respects him as a father. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s also true that if he wants to use his son Yuzuru as a tool in a political marriage, he could do so easily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He has no hesitation in using his own son Yuzuru, so it goes without saying that he will use Arisa who is a stranger to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, Arisa had to be protected from Amagi, but she also had to be protected from Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, Takasegawa is probably her worst enemy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Calm, cold-hearted, and cold-blooded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Never leave any stone unturned to achieve a goal.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They are a cunning family that excels at scheming and laying the groundwork.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s how the world views Takasegawa, and it’s not wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The threat of the ‘Takasegawa’ is best known to Yuzuru, who is a member of the ‘Takasegawa’ clan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">From his father and grandfather’s point of view, he was an extremely rebellious son, Yuzuru chuckled inwardly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” “……” “</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the other hand, Soichiro and Hijiri looked at each other when they heard Yuzuru’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they asked Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then, if you fall in love with her for real, and you think you want her even by force, what will you do?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What would you do if Yukishiro sought you out from her side?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru cowered in response.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I guess we’ll see at that time.”</p>
	
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru-kun’s seriousness: 50%</p>
