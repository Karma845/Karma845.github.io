<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Fiancée and Study Session</h3>
	
	<p class="block_7">By the way, that Saturday was Yuzuru’s birthday, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, it was less than four days before the next national mock exam.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why the birthday mood was not so pleasant.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa had spread out their study tools and were reviewing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was nothing they could do about the modern Japanese, so for the time being, they were working on the ancient Chinese and English grammar and vocabulary, as well as the math exercises.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yuzuru-san, you’re really going all out this time.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m seriously thinking of aiming to defeat Ayaka this time. As ‘Takasegawa’, I don’t want to be defeated by ‘Tachibana’ forever,”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, one of the reasons was that I was inspired by Arisa’s motivation and study attitude.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If Yuzuru-san is aiming to defeat Ayaka-san, then …… I’m going to defeat Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then you’d be first and I’d be second. Let’s both do our best.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">And as Yuzuru and Arisa were getting motivated, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">As if to interrupt them, Yuzuru’s smartphone rang.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Speak of the devil, it’s Ayaka.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A message was sent to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The content of the message was, “Let’s go on a date tomorrow”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What does date mean? …… Is it a study session?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru wondered, [A study group?] He typed back.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Ayaka shot back a stamp that seemed to affirm it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">[Soichiro-kun, I and Chiharu-chan have tentatively decided.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">[Soichiro-kun is asking out Ryozenji-san, and Chiharu-chan is asking out Nagiri-san.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">[Yuzurun, you come with Arisa-chan.♥]</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru showed the screen to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And then he asked.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you want to do? By the way, let me tell you, …… you probably won’t be able to study properly. I’m sure they’re going to use the name “study group” as an excuse to have some fun.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, as long as it’s called a study group, they will study.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka is the type of person who can get by with just a little bit of work, and Soichiro is a man who looks like he’s got a good head on his shoulders, so he does the bare minimum.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Chiharu is the kind of person who would just go bouncy and play.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it will be less wearisome than doing it alone. </p>
	<p class="block_7">“Study group, huh? I’d like to go……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you sure it’s okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes. …… Well, and I don’t think that doing a little bit of study three days in advance is going to make a big difference in the test results.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, that’s true, too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both Yuzuru and Arisa are still in their first year of high school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is not necessary to be so concerned with the results of the mock exam.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Socializing is more important than “papers.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then I’ll reply with okay”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you very much.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru replied to Ayaka, [I’ll go with Arisa.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">But soon after that, she said, [That’s a very quick response. Is Arisa-chan there?]</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was amazed at Ayaka’s keen intuition.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sunday morning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa met at the station closest to Ayaka’s house, the venue for the study session.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry to keep you waiting.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I just got here too. Well, let’s go.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa didn’t know where Ayaka lived.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That is why Yuzuru had to show her around.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, it stands out, so we’ll find it easily.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Is Ayaka-san’s house big as well?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, to a point.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the meantime, they arrived at Ayaka’s house, the Tachibana residence.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s really stylish, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a pseudo-Western building built in the Meiji era. It’s a bit of a cultural heritage.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka’s house was completely different from Yuzuru’s.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is a western-style building made of beautiful red bricks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Strictly speaking, …… it is called “pseudo-western architecture,” which is, in essence, a “fake” European style.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is based on a Western style but incorporates Japanese and Chinese architectural designs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Speaking of which, Yuzuru-san’s house is also old, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …… it has been rebuilt and remodeled many times, but the foundation was probably built around the same time as this house.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, strictly speaking, the ages may be slightly different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">While they were standing there talking, Yuzuru rang the intercom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hello, this is Yuzuru Takasegawa, your invited guest.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">[“What is the password?”]</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No such thing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">[“Very well.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">After a while, the outer gate opened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A smiling Ayaka was standing there.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Welcome. Well, come on in.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At her invitation, they went through the outer gate and entered the mansion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They walked on the cobblestones and then went up to the entrance of the mansion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sorry to bother you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Excuse me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">An elderly man greeted Yuzuru and Arisa as they walked up to the entrance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru bowed lightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa continued to bow her head as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I will be in your care today Tachibana-san”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you for inviting me. I’m Arisa Yukishiro.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru and Arisa greeted him, the older man replied with a somewhat cold expression and a cold voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“My niece has always been in your care …… Yuzuru-kun. And it’s nice to meet you, Yukishiro-san. I’ve heard rumors about your father…… Amagi-san, for some time now.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then the man &ndash; Ayaka’s uncle &ndash; said briefly, “Take your time,” and left for the back of the mansion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa asked Ayaka and Yuzuru anxiously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… have I done something wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru answered to reassure Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That person is always like that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka’s uncle.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The current head of the Tachibana family (self-proclaimed “acting head”), Toranosuke Tachibana, is very taciturn and silent, and always seems to be in a bad mood.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But in reality, he is just not good at socializing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“In fact, he’s in a good mood today. My uncle is a bit of a kuudere.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka giggled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though they are uncle and niece, their personalities are not very similar.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, I see. …… Oh! Um, I forgot to give you this souvenir …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said and handed Ayaka a paper bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was the sweets that her foster father had given her as a souvenir.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, thank you. You don’t have to worry about it. Well, I’ll open it later.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka then took the paper bag from Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she beckoned lightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, come on up”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Once again, I’ll be bothering you”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa took off their shoes, changed into slippers, and walked down the long hallway.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The exterior was red,…… but the hallway was covered with a bright red carpet, so the inside was also red in many ways.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“As usual, the house looks like something a vampire would live in.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Isn’t it nice and cool?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Yuzuru, it was not unusual since he had visited this house many times before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But for Arisa, it seemed to be interesting in many ways.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She scurried around the house, looking around.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yuzuru and Arisa-san are arriving!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka then opened the door to the room with an announcement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A beautiful marble table and a leather sofa surrounded it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Four people were sitting there.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro Satake, Chiharu Uenishi, Hijiri Ryozenji, and Tenka Nagiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that Yuzuru and company were the last to arrive.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re late.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t you think this calls for a punishment game?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’ve been waiting for you, Yuzuru, Yukishiro-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been a while. Takasegawa-kun, Yukshiro-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s so intense that you feel a little heartburn.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru inwardly thought to himself.</p>
