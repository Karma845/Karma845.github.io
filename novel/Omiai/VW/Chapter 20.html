<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; Staying with Fiancée (HomeEdition)</h3>

	<p class="block_6">“I’m coming. Hang in there!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hurry up, ……, hurry up, please help me, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru shouted out, a timid voice replied.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That reminded Yuzuru that she said she didn’t like the dark.</p>
	<p class="block_7">First, he walked to the changing room, relying on the light from his smartphone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he spoke to Arisa through the glass door of the bathroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, Arisa. Are you okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yuzuru-san! Please help me. …… I can’t take it. It’s too dark and cramped. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A voice that sounded like it was about to die came back.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Calm down. Can you move on your own?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I can’t. …… Please help me, quickly.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I mean, even if you asked me to help…..”</p>
	<p class="block_7">This darkness is probably a blackout.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There’s nothing you can do about the electricity.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru wanted to help Arisa as much as he could, but there was nothing he could do as long as she was completely naked in the bathroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Can I come in ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes! Please hurry up! I can’t take it anymore ……..”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t give up. I’ll come in with my eyes closed.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said and opened the door after closing his eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He then pointed the light of his smartphone at the place where Arisa would probably be.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then something cool and chilly clung to Yuzuru’s body.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yuzuru-san!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You idiot! Don’t stick to me when you’re drenched! No, don’t stick to me even if you’re not drenched!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said and then took hold of Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He felt her slick, smooth skin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He pulled her away from his body forcefully.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he took her hand and made her hold the smartphone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This will help you get by, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes. …… Thank you very much”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll keep my eyes closed. Wipe yourself down and get dressed”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru then walked out of the changing room and sat down in front of its door with his back to it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Occasionally, Arisa would ask, ” Yuzuru-san, are you there ……?”, “Please stay there!” and he would answer each time and encourage her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After a while, the door to the changing room slowly opened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The only light source was from my smartphone, so it was hard to tell, but it looked like she was wearing a jersey.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“S, sorry for the commotion.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …… can’t blame you for being scared.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Good grief.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He wanted to say that, but Yuzuru decided to comfort Arisa, believing that she was not doing it to cause trouble.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And at that moment, the electricity came back on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The lights came back on in the house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He sighed unconsciously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Someway, the timing is terrible.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“T, that’s right.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, fearing the possibility of another blackout, they decided to get ready for bed early.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Well, all they had to do was take my sleeping bag out of the closet and lay it down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, a problem arose here.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, Arisa. As expected, sleeping in the same room is ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I mean! If there’s another blackout, it’ll be pitch dark.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa insisted on sleeping in the same room as Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You know, ……, aren’t you worried, in general? I’ve said it many times, but I’m a guy too. While lightning may be harmful, the worst it can do is a blackout…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Power outages are dangerous. I think it would be safer for both of us if we slept in the same room.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s face was very pale as she said this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When someone asks so desperately for help, Yuzuru can’t force it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… No, it’s Arisa who was forcing herself, though</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is there a reason why you don’t like the dark?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s because …… I’m scared. You know, I used to ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When she was a child.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whenever she made a mistake, her foster mother would lock her in a closet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Because of this trauma, she still has a weakness for dark and small places.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That is what Arisa said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m really sorry for the trouble I’ve caused you, Yuzuru-san. But ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, if that’s the case, then I guess it can’t be helped.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Don’t worry about it. </p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said as he comforted Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Come to think of it, I’ll be in bed and you’ll be in a sleeping bag on the floor. Then it won’t be that dangerous. ……right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is not really ideal to sleep next to each other, but there is a height difference.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s probably acceptable,……, and Yuzuru decided to convince himself of this on his own.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Bedtime.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru decided to turn on the night light as Arisa wanted.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(……The nightlight is surprisingly bright.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally he doesn’t turn them on, so he’s never really paid attention to them, but …… they’re pretty bright.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s going to be a little difficult to sleep today, Yuzuru sighed inwardly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not a problem though, because tomorrow is Sunday.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If there’s going to be a blackout, I hope it’s while I’m sleeping.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, on the other hand, looked up at the nightlight with a bit of anxiety.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The current brightness is not so bad for her, as she usually sleeps in the nightlight.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …… if you’re unlucky enough to be awake when the power goes out again, wake me up. I’ll be here except when I have to go to the bathroom.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t worry about it. …… Good night, then.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said this to Arisa and closed his eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa also murmured, “Good night”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, about ten minutes later, or so yuzuru felt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……um, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Mm? What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Did I wake you……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I was awake… …… What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Does she want to go to the bathroom?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru tilted his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It has been a long time since their last horror movie, so she should be able to handle that much on her own by now.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s just that …… My heart is pounding so much that I am not able to sleep.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s heart jumped with a thud.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, Arisa probably didn’t mean it with particularly deep meaning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s that kind of unique tension, like the night of a school trip, that makes it hard to sleep. …… It would be like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, a girl staying at a man’s house saying, “My heart is pounding so much that I am not able to sleep” was quite cute. But at the same time, it’s also very seductive and meaningful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">To the extent that he almost misunderstood.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What about you, Yuzuru-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …… I’m a little nervous too”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, it was slightly different from Arisa’s ” heart-pounding “.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, like Arisa, it is not that he does not feel excited about this unique situation at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be a bit tasteless to force himself to sleep like this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shall we play Shiritori?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s great. …… Let’s start with ‘R’. Apple.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Ringo</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Gorilla.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Gorira</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sea otter!” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Rakko</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Koala.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Koara</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“ra …… camel!” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">rakuda</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Da. …… Bolster.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Dakimakura</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey. You’re being too cunning with all those ‘Ra’!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s what Shiritori is.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Mumu. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">About ten minutes had passed since they started playing Shiritori.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ‘’Ra,’ ‘ra,’ ra,’ ‘ra.’ ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, who couldn’t get a word starting with ‘Ra’, was mumbling to herself. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">The voice was cut off in the middle.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he heard a lovely, sleeping sound.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Pretending to turn over in drowsiness……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru looked at Arisa’s face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a very vulnerable, cute, and defenseless sleeping face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Enough to make him want to swoop down and attack her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Good grief……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sighed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And then, suddenly, he had a question.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(…… Speaking of which, is Arisa wearing underwear now?<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">That night, Yuzuru spent a lot of time in agony.</p>
	<p class="block_12"></p>
	<p class="block_7">True dere degree: 25% → 32%</p>
