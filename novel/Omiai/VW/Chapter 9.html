<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Fiancée and The Horror Movie</h3>

	<p class="block_6">The movie was based on the so-called “Seven Wonders of School”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They had heard that it was popular among students, probably because it was set in a familiar place, a school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As it had a reputation for being scary, Yuzuru was also scared to the extent that his body trembled, although he did not raise his voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whenever ghosts and ghouls attacked people, his heart would pound.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What’s more ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“He~ei!’</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hiya!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Kya!!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The actions of Arisa, who hugged Yuzuru’s arm every time she made a cute scream, made Yuzuru even more nervous.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the second half of the film, Arisa was trembling, holding Yuzuru’s hand, her eyes shut.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She probably didn’t even watch the last fifteen minutes of the movie.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">When the movie ended, Yuzuru called out to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Whoa! Yuzuru-san, is that you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“There’s no one else here but me. Are you okay ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I..I…I’m fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With Arisa, who didn’t seem to be fine at all, Yuzuru decided to leave the place as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was so scared that she kept her body tightly attached to Yuzuru’s arm even after it became brighter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I can’t go to the washroom at …… school tomorrow.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Said Arisa with a blue face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her eyes were slightly moist.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“If you’re so bad with scary stuff, you should have stopped…… I guess we should refrain from watching horror movies next time.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Arisa shook her head from side to side with a jerk.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It was scary, but …… it was interesting. I’m not a fan of scary things……, but I don’t mind horror.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Could it be that this girl is stupid?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru really thought so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, he felt that the motive itself of watching horror to see something scary was not wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“By the way, Arisa. Can I go to the washroom?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, you can’t! Please don’t leave me alone right now!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With that, Arisa squeezed and grabbed Yuzuru’s arm, pulling him closer to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although it is very hard to leave when someone says so with teary eyes. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, you see. …… But I’m at my wits’ end.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Can’t you put up with it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How long do I have to be …… patient?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s …… forever.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was not sure if Arisa knew that she’s asking an unreasonable thing, but she looked away and said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But there is no sign of letting go of Yuzuru’s arm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since he had no choice, Yuzuru asked Arisa a slightly nasty question.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you okay with doing that? …… I think you drank the same amount of juice as me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? That’s ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru pointed this out, Arisa’s legs began to tremble visibly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, she had been unaware of it until now because of her fear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think of the idea of …… staying with each other until the last minute?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think you need to use some common sense.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s true, isn’t it? Right. …… At any rate, let’s head to the ladies’ room. I’ll be ready by then.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa suggested. So Yuzuru headed with her to where the restroom was located.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, Arisa can’t go into the men’s restroom, and Yuzuru can’t go into the women’s restroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And then, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’re splitting up, okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Be quick, please.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, I’ll try.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What are you planning to do?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru did not ask.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The horror movie they had just seen had a ghost about a toilet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps, by the looks of it, she still didn’t dare to go into the bathroom alone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru ran into the bathroom to get things done as quickly as possible for Arisa’s sake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then there was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Huh? Is that you, Hijiri?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He spotted a familiar-looking man washing his hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru called out to him to check, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” And that’s you, Yuzuru? …..That’s a strange coincidence.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s my line. You’re not a …… Hijiri doppelganger, are you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’ve seen that movie?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So you’ve seen it too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seemed that both Yuzuru and Hijiri had been watching the same movie.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They must not have bumped into each other in the hall because their entry times were different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re not watching a horror movie …… with someone, are you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri asked Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was a little unsure of what to say, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">In front of the restroom, Arisa is waiting for Yuzuru as she battles the adversary, so it will soon be revealed that he came with Arisa anyway.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was no use trying to deceive.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So he tried to be honest and say that he came with Arisa, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">(Wait, what?)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Suddenly, a good idea came to Yuzuru’s mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, Hijiri. Are <span class="calibre5">you …</span>…also here with someone?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, ……, don’t answer a question with a question.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He seemed to be a little agitated.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, Yuzuru was right.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is it a girl?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What are you going to do by asking that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” It’s Tenka Nagiri, isn’t it? You were together before.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Well……So? What’s this all about?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru bowed his head to Hijiri, who asked sullenly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry, there’s just one thing I need to ask you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s the matter, suddenly?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru suddenly bowed to him, Hijiri looked puzzled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, it’s not unusual for Yuzuru to ask for something from Hijiri,……, but this was the first time he had ever asked for something so seriously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Your companion …… doesn’t matter if it’s Nagiri-san or anyone else, but if it’s a girl, ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah! It’s Nagiri, to be frank. But why does that matter?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru grabbed Hijiri by the shoulders.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, with an uncanny sense of urgency, he asks Hijiri for help.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Please help my companion, …… Arisa!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Later, when they met up, Tenka had a very confused look on her face. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">She accompanied Arisa to the bathroom.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">After Arisa was out of the crisis, Hijiri and Tenka heard more details about the situation &ndash; that is, Arisa couldn’t go to the washroom…….</p>
	<p class="block_7">They held their stomachs and laughed hysterically.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Incidentally, Arisa was extremely angry with Yuzuru.</p>
