<h3>Chapter 34 &#8211; Christmas Eve with Fiancée</h3>

	<p class="block_6">The closing ceremony was over in the morning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa did not go home that day but went straight to Yuzuru’s house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both of them changed into their casual clothes and had a quick lunch at a nearby cafe.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they started to prepare for Christmas in earnest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru had already bought the ingredients he had specified in advance, so all that was left was to cook.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, Yuzuru-san. I’ll be doing the cooking, so please take care of the decorations.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, leave it to me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally Yuzuru doesn’t decorate for Christmas, but today was the day he would be spending with Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Thinking about it, he naturally felt motivated.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And by the time Yuzuru finished putting up the decorations, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">The smell of delicious food was in the air.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yuzuru-san, it’s ready. Can you help me serve the food?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, sure.”</p>
	<p class="block_7"> Baguette.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> Avocado and shrimp wreath salad.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> Beef stew.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> Roast chicken.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> Fried chicken.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> French fries.</p>
	<p class="block_7"> Christmas cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That was the menu for today.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Incidentally, except for the baguette from the bakery, everything was handmade by Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, let’s have a toast.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru took out a bottled drink from the refrigerator.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was crystal clear and beautiful, with bubbles of carbonation visible inside.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve been wondering about that. …… Is it champagne, by any chance?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What would Arisa do if I said yes?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru asked jokingly, …… Arisa thought for a moment and then answered.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… No. You are underage and you are not allowed to drink. I will scold you, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s harsh. …… But don’t worry. It’s just juice.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s a champagne-style apple juice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, it is a non-alcoholic beverage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… In fact, Yuzuru usually drank alcohol at Christmas and at the end of the year, when relatives gather. But this time he was very careful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a decision made knowing Arisa would be angry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, just for the sake of atmosphere, have a sip. If it doesn’t suit your taste, you can leave it. I’ve prepared other drinks.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, I understand. It’s a good opportunity.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru prepared a champagne glass and poured the juice into it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he and Arisa raised their glasses.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Cheers, then.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, cheers.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">They bumped their glasses together in a small way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they took a sip of the juice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It only looks like champagne, so the taste is different from champagne.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it was a refreshing and tasty juice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think, Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think I like it a lot.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She smiled and took a sip.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not real alcohol, but Arisa’s skin was slightly inflamed and a little shiny.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, since we’re here… let’s have some of the food as well.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, please”</p>
	<p class="block_7">For starters, Yuzuru reached for the wreath salad.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was beautifully decorated to look like a Christmas wreath, and it looked very beautiful…</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, it’s delicious. The seasoning that Arisa makes is better than the store-bought kind.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you very much. I make it according to the vegetables I use for the salad.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“As expected of you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru praised her, Arisa’s cheeks blushed in embarrassment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she scratched her cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was very cute.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Next, he took a bite of the beef stew.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he put the meat in my mouth, it melted in his mouth. </p>
	<p class="block_7">“This meat is so tender.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been stewed for a long time. …… I usually don’t do it because it takes too much time, but it’s my specialty.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said with a bit of pride.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As it is her specialty, it is very tasty.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The other dishes were also very good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But more than that,…</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That is delightful.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you. …… If you praise me so much, it makes it worth making.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… No, well, there’s no doubt that Arisa’s cooking is delicious too. But..”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Arisa tilted her head curiously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her beautiful flaxen hair swayed slightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her emerald eyes stared at Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you mean?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“… I think I’m having a delightful time because I’m with you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, Arisa’s cooking is delicious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But more than that,</p>
	<p class="block_7">The meals shared with Arisa are delicious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, ……, this, you see. I’m a little embarrassed to even dare to say this, but…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru scratched his cheek.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He could feel his own face getting hot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you for spending time with me today. I really enjoyed it. …… Will you hang out with me again next year?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ye, yes. …I’d be happy to.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa replied with a shy, but clear, nod. </p>
	<p class="block_7">Somehow, Yuzuru felt a sense of euphoria.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He felt like he could say things now that he had been too embarrassed to say.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… What.. is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… From now on as well, will you continue to cook for me, please?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Arisa’s expression froze.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, a little later, her face turned bright red, like a boiled octopus.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru called out to the silent Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa seemed to come back to herself and straightened her back.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, yes! Well, it would be my pleasure!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">And Arisa took Yuzuru’s hand in hers.</p>
	
	<p class="block_11">Arisa True Dere degree: 75% → 100%</p>
	<p class="block_11">Yuzuru’s Seriousness: 80% → 90%</p>
	<p class="block_11">The gauge has …</p>
