<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Childhood Friend and Test Results</h3>

<p>The first day of school after the sports festival.</p>



<p>Early in the morning of that day, the (second) national mock exam results from the summer vacation were returned.</p>



<p>After the exam results were returned, the students were &#8230;&#8230; in a state of uproar.</p>



<p>Not many of them had happy expressions on their faces.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s high school is classified as an &#8220;advanced school&#8221;.</p>



<p>Therefore, the students who gather at this high school are made up of honor students who can study well in middle school. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>The level of difficulty in studying is one level different between junior high school and high school.</p>



<p>In addition, this high school has very loose school rules and hardly any assignments.</p>



<p>In Yuzuru&#8217;s experience, the summer vacation assignments were less than a tenth of what they had been in middle school.</p>



<p>In short, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a slacker, then you&#8217;ll end up staying a slacker.</p>



<p>Due to the difference in the number of students in the population of the mock exams, it seems that most of the students had worse results than expected.</p>



<p>Incidentally, regarding Yuzuru&#8217;s results&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>(&#8230;&#8230;Well, that&#8217;s pretty good.)</p>



<p>Although Yuzuru is not very serious,&#8230;&#8230;, he does put in a good amount of effort in his schoolwork.</p>



<p>In other words, he tries to make sure that he can keep up with his classes.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the best, but it&#8217;s a better grade.</p>



<p>By the way, how was Arisa?</p>



<p>Yuzuru turned his head slightly to check her face.</p>



<p>She seemed to have already finished looking at the results and was folding the individual chart paper and storing it in a file.</p>



<p>Her expression was the usual calm, cool, and expressionless.</p>



<p>The people around her were gossiping about her, saying things like &#8220;Yukishiro-san, you look like you can relax&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you did well&#8221;.</p>



<p>But &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>(That&#8217;s probably because she&#8217;s depressed.)</p>



<p>Tomorrow is Saturday.</p>



<p>He decided to give her a little comfort.</p>



<p>After school that day.</p>



<p>As Yuzuru was about to leave, someone hit him hard from behind.</p>



<p>When he turned around to see who it was &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>There was a girl he had known since childhood who seemed to be in a very good mood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuzurun. How was the mock exam?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a beautiful girl with semi-long black hair who was smiling broadly.</p>



<p>It was Ayaka Tachibana.</p>



<p>Her slightly reddish amber eyes were glowing brightly.</p>



<p>“Is there any reason why I should tell you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just go along with it. We&#8217;re childhood friends. I mean, is there any reason you shouldn&#8217;t tell me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, no.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s nothing to hide.</p>



<p>Yuzuru took out a file from his bag.</p>



<p>Then Ayaka rounded her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzurun is filing the individual sheets of the mock exam! It&#8217;s going to rain tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so rude.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, Ayaka was understandably surprised, since he had been sloppy with his management in middle school.</p>



<p>The reason why Yuzuru thought of organizing the mock exams in a file in the first place was that he heard that that&#8217;s how Arisa saved her exam results and such.</p>



<p>It may be a bit of a hassle now, but it will be easier later, okay?</p>



<p>So he was told, and he decided to give it a try.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, as expected of Yuzurun. You&#8217;re really strong in these off-campus mock exams, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then she made a little exclamation of admiration.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, You&#8217;re second. In the school rankings.&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looks like it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem too happy about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, what good is a school ranking?&#8221;</p>



<p>College entrance exams are fought on a national level.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with good standing in the school, but there&#8217;s no point in being happy about it.</p>



<p>Besides, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s losing to the girl in front of him anyway.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m &#8230;..&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in the first place anyway, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked, and Ayaka&#8217;s eyes narrowed.</p>



<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re strong in off-campus exams. I mean, you can’t be worse than me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru had a certain amount of faith in this girl Ayaka Tachibana when it came to the quality of her brain.</p>



<p>She was very smart.</p>



<p>Yuzuru had never beaten Ayaka in a test like this before in his life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, well &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m good at these &#8216;papers&#8217;.&#8221;</p>



<p>An examination is just a paper.</p>



<p>But despite her words, she proudly showed Yuzuru her results.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s impressive.&#8221;</p>



<p>He looked at Ayaka&#8217;s individual chart and muttered to himself.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was only able to beat Ayaka in one of the three subjects.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s so frustrating. I lost in English, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I lose to &#8216;Tachibana&#8217; in all subjects, I won&#8217;t be able to stand as &#8216;Takasegawa&#8217;. &#8230;&#8230; You can cut corners a little, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>He lost to &#8216;Tachibana&#8217; again.</p>



<p>Yuzuru thought to himself that he would rather not have to report this to his parents.</p>



<p>Although there is no clear conflict, the Takasegawa family has a slight rivalry with the Tachibana family.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let up. I want to tell my uncle that I&#8217;ve beaten &#8216;Takasegawa&#8217; again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka&#8217;s parents had died.</p>



<p>So her guardian is her paternal uncle.</p>



<p>In that respect, her situation is a bit similar to Arisa’s.</p>



<p>However&#8230;&#8230; The relationship between Ayaka and her uncle is very good, so that is completely different.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, but, Yuzurun&#8230; It&#8217;s just a paper, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka tapped Yuzuru on the shoulder.</p>



<p>This is what you call the luxury of being a winner.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish I could say those words to Ayaka someday.&#8221;</p>



<p>It might be a good idea to make a real effort to win against Ayaka.</p>



<p>Yuzuru suddenly thought of such a thing.</p>



<p>Later that day, in the evening.</p>



<p>Unusually, a package arrived from his parents&#8217; house.</p>



<p>It said that it needed to be refrigerated.</p>



<p>It seemed to be some food item.</p>



<p>When he opened the cardboard, he found styrofoam and a letter.</p>



<p>The letter said, &#8220;I got this from someone I know, so I&#8217;ll share it with you. Have Arisa cook it for you.&#8221; The letter was short and to the point.</p>



<p>The sender seemed to be his mother.</p>



<p>When he opened the Styrofoam&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A strong smell stimulated Yuzuru&#8217;s nostrils.</p>



<p>That smell was coming from &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. I guess when you have this many of them, it gets smelly.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a large number of matsutake mushrooms.</p>
