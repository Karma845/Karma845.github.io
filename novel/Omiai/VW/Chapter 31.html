<h3>Chapter 31 &#8211; Fiancée and Sister</h3>

<p>"Sorry to keep you waiting, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I just got here too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The meeting place was a certain station in the city center.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru saw Arisa’s outfit …, he was a little bit relieved.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><br class="calibre7" />This time, she wasn’t wearing something that would show off her body lines like last time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She wore a black long-sleeved shirt with a thin white cardigan and wide pants.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And on top of that, she was wearing an autumn coat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was less stimulating, and Yuzuru felt a little more relaxed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Where’s Ayumi-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“She’s late. But, I think it’s about time. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At that moment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a thud, he was hugged from behind as if he were being hit by something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Niisan!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re late, Ayumi.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, I’m sorry. I got stuck in traffic.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, she had come by cab.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She probably avoided coming by train because of the risk of molestation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been a while, Arisa-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been a while, Ayumi-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi ran up to Arisa and grabbed her hand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I’m sorry I forced you to go out with me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s okay. I would be happy to be of assistance.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve always thought that Arisa-san’s clothes were fashionable. I’m counting on you!　…I’ll tell you what my brother prefers as gratitude.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hahaha ……, please do!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa replied to Ayumi’s words with a wry smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru, on the other hand, raised his guard at the mention of Ayumi’s “brother’s preference”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He had to be careful that she didn’t say anything strange.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s going to be a long day ahead of us anyway.　Let’s go quickly.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa and Ayumi nodded in agreement to Yuzuru’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and company entered a shopping mall near the station that had a variety of stores, including high-end stores.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, hey, Arisa-san. Which one do you think looks better on me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi said while holding two different winter coats in her hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One was beige and the other was gray.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru would say that both look good on her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… In fact, Ayumi, who is a beautiful girl, would look good in both.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think they both look good on you… Let’s see. The former gives off a cute image, while the latter gives off a beautiful image.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, so the former is more childish?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, I suppose so. Well, I think it’s pretty cute.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…Is the gray more mature?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, it looks more mature. It makes you look a year or two older.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi pondered for about a dozen seconds before deciding …</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that she has decided to go with gray, and Yuzuru put the coat in the basket in his hand.</p>
	<p class="block_11">(…I wonder if she’s concerned about it)</p>
	<p class="block_7">In Yuzuru’s mind, Ayumi will always be his cute little sister, so the image of a child is firmly established.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So it was a little surprising that she was concerned about her being childish.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She’s still in the second year of junior high school, so it’s fine to be childish.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, she probably wants to grow up to be taller and more mature.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Anyway, are you done?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A woman’s shopping trip is a long one.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And there are two of them. It was even longer because they were chattering away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was already getting tired.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“With clothes, yeah. But after this, I want to look at shoes. Don’t you want to check them too, Arisa-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right… I still have some money left, and I want to buy some boots.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">No matter what he said, it would only prolong the process, so Yuzuru decided to go along with them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For the time being, he finished paying for the clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_11">(… Let’s invite Soichiro or Hijiri next time.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">He wondered if three men would be enough to alleviate some of this boredom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But when he thought about it, calling those two guys meant that Ayaka, Chiharu, and Tenka would be there as a set.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A shopping trip for five women.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The sun would probably set.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru stopped thinking about it because he was horrified just by the thought of it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, Niisan. Let’s go to the shoe store.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi invited Yuzuru to go to a store that sold shoes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, Yuzuru held out the paper bag to Arisa and Ayumi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sorry. Mind if I take a quick side trip?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, the washroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Ayumi puffed out her cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ew!　Make it quick.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s faster than your shopping.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said and began to search the bathroom with a short run.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It took about fifteen minutes because the bathroom was hard to find.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Ayumi must be in a bad mood…</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sighed inwardly as he hurried to the meeting place.</p>
	<p class="block_11">(I mean, why should I be blamed for being a little late when I’m accompanying them on their shopping trip?)</p>
	<p class="block_7">He felt that it was a little bit unreasonable. But he couldn’t leave the two princesses waiting, so he started running.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then…</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa and Ayumi were talking about something with a boy who seemed familiar.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it seemed that it was mainly Ayumi and the boy who was talking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was a little behind Ayumi and seemed to be overseeing the situation.</p>
	<p class="block_11">(Just when I took my eyes off them for a moment, …… it turned out to be troublesome.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sighed inwardly and approached them with a short run.</p>
