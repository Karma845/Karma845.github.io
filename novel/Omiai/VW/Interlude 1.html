<h3>Interlude 1 &#8211; Circumstances of Adults</h3>
	
	<p class="block_7">A few days after the summer festival, in a certain part of Tokyo.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Two people were sitting at the counter of a certain bar.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One is a mild-mannered man with blue eyes and black hair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He is Yuzuru’s father and the current head of the Takasegawa family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The other was a dour-looking man with amber eyes and black hair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke Tachibana.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He is Ayaka’s uncle and the current head of the Tachibana family (he calls himself the “acting head”).</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them had empty glasses in their hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that a lot of alcohol has already been consumed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, by the way, I heard a rumor. Kazuya.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke called Kazuya by name in a friendly manner.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Just as Yuzuru and Ayaka are close, the two of them are close as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">To the extent that they call each other by name in private.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, a rumor. Is that a …… good rumor?　You mean it’s the result of my daily work?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sure, it could be a result of your daily work. But …… what I’ve heard are bad rumors.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The bartender silently placed the cocktail on the counter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke and Kazuya picked up their glasses and brought the alcohol to their mouths.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve heard that Takasegawa used the money to buy women.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Hmm.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke’s words were neither confirmed nor denied by Kazuya.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But his eyes narrowed slightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke’s tone of voice was contemptuous, but his eyes were laughing as he condemned Kazuya.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If you want my help, you’ll have to give me your daughter? You’re still as dirty as ever. You Takasegawa people.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re a bad listener, you know that? …… You’ve got the order backward. I gave a loan to support my son’s loved one’s house. I hope you don’t misunderstand that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Kazuya lightly swirled the glass of cocktail in his hand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“And whether this marriage works or not, I’m going to continue my business with Naoki Amagi ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hoh……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“He has something my family doesn’t have……. I don’t want to be one of those outdated families.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Takasegawa,</p>
	<p class="block_7">Rather, it can be said of the entire Japanese business community. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">When it comes to the IT industry, Japan lags in comparison to other countries.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Naoki Amagi can bring it to Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At least Kazuya judged so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is why he invested a huge amount of capital.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Maybe it’s just because I’m a parent, but I think Yuzuru is more than up to par as a man. That’s why he has no trouble finding someone to marry. There’s no reason to pay for it. You understand that, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s business and money that matters.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The support for Naoki Amagi was based on the judgment that there would be a great return for the Takasegawa family in the future.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was definitely not for the “purchase” of Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Takasegawas are not a family that is involved in human trafficking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya made his point over a drink.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s why, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… What do you mean, Toranosuke.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s because you don’t want to give the money growing tree to anyone else that you insisted on taking hostages, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You have a nasty way of saying that, don’t you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya picked up a piece of chocolate that was served as a snack.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“All I asked for was a token of trust. And it’s also a sign of trust from me. It was mutually agreed upon. Naoki Amagi also liked the idea of forming a blood relationship with us. It’s a win-win situation for both of us.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since the company is making a huge loan, it would be a huge loss if they escaped.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">And for Amagi, They didn’t want Takasegawa to suck up all their skills and knowledge and throw them away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why Amagi and Takasegawa offered their precious children to each other.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, the main objective is not economic gain by providing support and loans to Amagi, but political gain &ndash; the announcement that Naoki Amagi will become a subsidiary of Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya explained this to Toranosuke. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s sophistry. Think about the power relationship. You’re as smooth-talking as ever.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Haha, ……, I didn’t know you wouldn’t understand even if I tried to say so much. The money-grubbing Tachibana cannot understand this exchange between the two families, which is full of humanity.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, Naoki Amagi would probably be very grateful for Yuzuru and Arisa’s engagement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This proves how much importance Takasegawa attaches to Amagi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In all likelihood, …… the power relationship between the two families is obvious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even if both parties are satisfied, there are those who, like Toranosuke &ndash; and he is only making fun of him, not really saying it &ndash; see it as Takasegawa threatening them with money and power.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But let them say whatever they want.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Originally, the Takasegawa family had many enemies.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is impossible to get along with all the people in this world.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Therefore, there is no choice but to make a decision.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But there is something that concerns me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, what is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Why did you choose the daughter who is not related to Amagi by blood?　Amagi has another daughter. And a son.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition to Arisa Yukishiro, Naoki Amagi has a daughter and a son who are both blood-related.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whether it’s hostages or ” tokens of trust” ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">The one who is blood-related works better than the one who is not blood-related.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is just between us. though”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Mm.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“At first, it was going to be Amagi’s …… blood-related daughter.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As for Takasegawa, if you ask them which one they want, the one who is related by blood or the one who is not, the blood-related one is obviously the one he wants.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even for Amagi, it would be too rude to …… Takasegawa to bring out the daughter who is not blood-related.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Therefore, it was only natural that the blood-related daughter would be chosen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s just that she is only in the sixth grade. And …… Yuzuru would never want to do that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, that’s true.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Right?　<span class="calibre5">That’s why I thought I’d give it more time……. I was going to tell Yuzuru that there was a marriage proposal, and I was going to take it in stages and have them meet at the right time.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">More specifically, four years from now.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">The original plan was to have them meet when Amagi’s daughter turned fifteen and Yuzuru turned nineteen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, so …… what made you rush?　Don’t tell me it’s the deal between Tachibana and the continent.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I’m aware of that, too. But the main reason is something else.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… What’s that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya didn’t answer the question right away. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Slowly, he savored his cocktail.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He then said with a face slightly flushed with alcohol.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” My son’s love, I guess”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Haa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What is this guy talking about?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke tilted his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya explained to Toranosuke.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Originally, I knew that Yuzuru and Arisa ……, the non-blood-related daughter of Amagi, were in the same class.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm. …… So?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“When I hinted to Yuzuru about a marriage proposal, …… ‘I won’t get engaged unless I see a blonde-haired, blue-eyed beauty!’, is what he said.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa Yukishiro does not have blond hair and blue eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, her hair is close to blonde and her eyes are close to blue.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And best of all, she’s a beautiful girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru, who was in the same class as her, said that he preferred blond hair and blue eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This means ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No wonder he doesn’t want a marriage proposal. My son already had someone he liked.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s no longer an exaggeration to say that he was referring to Arisa herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru basically insisted that he wouldn’t marry anyone unless it was Arisa Yukishiro.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see, so that’s why it’s a win-win situation, huh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, that’s how it is. As for me, I want to support my son’s love.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The matchmaking between Takasegawa and Amagi is meant to strengthen the connection ……, in reverse, nothing more and nothing less.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So there is no reason why one should be concerned about direct blood relations.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Takasegawa would be troubled if Amagi didn’t formally adopt her before marrying her off and have her become Arisa Amagi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But that can be done after the formal engagement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Right now, it’s still in the tentative stage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There’s no need to rush.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“By the way, what does Naoki Amagi think about this?　Wouldn’t it be more convenient for him to use …… his own daughter?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s normal for him to want to marry off his own daughter if he’s going to strengthen the connection anyway.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Takasegawa family is one of the most prestigious families in this country.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are two daughters: one who is related by blood and one who is not. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally, they would tend to cherish the former and would want to provide a good match for her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” He was pleased. He said the Takasegawa family would be safe for her.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmmm, …… is that another way of saying that you don’t want to marry off your own daughter because she is cute?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Who knows…..That is all.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya shrugged his shoulders.</p>
	<p class="block_7">To Kazuya, Arisa’s position in the family was not that important.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The only thing that interests him is the next head of Amagi. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even that won’t affect many people.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If Amagi’s successor is capable, then the relationship should be continued.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he is incompetent, you can take advantage of the blood relationship that has been established and take it away from him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The children of Yuzuru Takasegawa and Amagi Arisa will have the right to inherit Amagi’s estate.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Calm, cold-hearted, and cold-blooded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s how the world views Kazuya Takasegawa, or rather the Takasegawa family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What about the people who are involved?　Amagi’s daughter, ……Arisa Yukishiro , was it? , 　If she doesn’t like your son, it’s a moot point.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, yes. As for me, I’d rather have a woman who loves my son as a family.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya does not deny political marriage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, he actively supports them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, he did not want to force a marriage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If internal conflicts occurred within the family, it would cause great damage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He doesn’t want to create a spark of conflict.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If Arisa Yukishiro hated Yuzuru from the bottom of her heart, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">He will have no choice but to give up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“From my point of view, they seem to be in love with each other …….. I’d love for them to get married and show me, my lovely grandchildren.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you like her too?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Of course. She has a good personality and a good disposition. She’s not stupid. She can cook well. She is also able to help Yuzuru. She is the best person to be welcomed by Takasegawa as a bride.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya said in a good mood.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, perhaps because he was drunk, his …… speech began to slip a little.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I have a feeling she’s going to give birth to and raise a healthy child.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t say that directly to her!　Unless you want your daughter-in-law to hate you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I know. I know, but there is nothing better than a cute grandchild, right?　Grandson or granddaughter. …… We’ll soon be grandpas, too. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Grandchildren, huh? I don’t have any children, so I’m not interested in that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke sniffed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was never married, so he had no children.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However,…… since there is Ayaka, the daughter of his deceased brother, there is no danger of Tachibana’s blood ceasing to flow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You have a lovely niece. …… Speaking of which, what’s going on?　Between Ayaka-san, Uenishi’s daughter, and Soichiro-kun ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ha~h, ……, don’t ask me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“By the looks of it, I’d say that mess over there is far from over.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Toranosuke looked exhausted, but Kazuya was in a good mood.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He must be feeling relieved that the relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa seems to be going well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Takasegawa had a little to do with this matter. If your son had been docile and gotten engaged to Uenishi, the story would have been much simpler.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I told you earlier that I can’t force him. I’m expecting Yuzuru’s child to repair the relationship with Uenishi.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm. That’s selfish.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re the selfish one, aren’t you?　If you had a son or daughter, you could have taken Ayaka-san as a daughter-in-law. Or you could have married her off to Satake, to our family, or to any other family. Well, it’s a little late for that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayaka is the heir to Tachibana.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re stubborn…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Say what you want.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Until late that night.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them continued to drink.</p>
