<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Fiancée, Family, and Homemade Food</h3>
	
	
	<p class="block_6">The result of our discussion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was decided that we would have a light meal such as somen noodles made by Sayori for lunch and that Arisa would make dinner a little earlier in the evening.</p>
	<p>And after lunch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, Arisa-sama. What should I buy?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked Arisa after visiting the supermarket.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Naturally, Yuzuru usually accompanies Arisa on her shopping trips, acting as her luggage handler.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This time, it was Yuzuru’s fault that Arisa had to do the housework, so it was only natural that he would come as her “chaperone”.</p>

	<p class="block_7">“It’s summer, and I’m thinking summer vegetables would be good. …… By the way, does Yuzuru-san’s family have any likes or dislikes?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t worry. I don’t remember there being anything in particular that we dislike.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Takasegawa family, including Yuzuru, have no particular dislikes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They can eat anything.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m glad to hear that. …… What are your favorite things?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, I have an image that Ayumi and my father like rather childish things. Curry, hamburgers, rice omelets…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see. Yuzuru-san likes …… fish, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response to Arisa’s question, Yuzuru nodded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“ah…I think my mom and I have similar tastes in food.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She put her hand on her chin and started to think about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was probably thinking about today’s menu.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru watched her closely, trying not to interrupt her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve decided. Let’s add a Japanese hamburger and some fish.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Isn’t that a lot of work? It’s more appropriate, though.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Even though I look like this, I’m very excited.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said as she clasped her hands together tightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that she was not lying when she said that she was not reluctant to cook for Yuzuru’s family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, let’s start with the vegetables. Summer vegetables are good.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">They went to the vegetable section first.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa already had an idea in her head of what to cook.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She threw okra, cucumber, shiso, eggplant, myoga, ginger, leek, and onion into the basket.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they went to the meat section.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And bought ground beef and pork.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now for the fish. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This horse mackerel is magnificent. It looks like it can be eaten raw, so shall we try this?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said happily, looking at the large horse mackerel soaked in ice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, she wasn’t going to use the fillets but was going to process the fish with her own hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he knew that Arisa could handle fish, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but be impressed by how she managed to do it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori loves fish, but she doesn’t like to cook it, and generally doesn’t handle it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that all?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’ll just buy some tofu and be done with it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Japanese-style hamburger steak was confirmed, but what else was she going to make?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s heart swelled with anticipation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was around 4:30.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and the others were waiting for Arisa’s cooking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m looking forward to Arisa-san’s cooking. Since Niisan raved about it, I have high expectations.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi said with an air of excitement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, Sayori had a complicated look on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m also looking forward to Arisa-chan’s cooking……. But I’ve always wanted to be like the mother-in-law in the drama, teaching my son’s wife the taste of our own home. I have mixed feelings about this.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Ayumi both made a comment to Sayori.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Mom’s flavor is Ajinomoto, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” You don’t have to teach her. There is sufficient ability to reproduce.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You guys, you’ve never cooked a proper meal in your life, and yet you keep saying that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Neither Yuzuru nor Ayumi can indeed cook, so they can not argue about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it was frustrating to be told off, so he changed the subject a bit to argue.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So you don’t have to help Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I told her I’d help. Then she said, ‘I don’t want to bother Mom’. She’s such a good girl.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Isn’t that just a notice of dismissal?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shut up.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Yuzuru, Ayumi and Sayori were arguing, Kazuya complained.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” You guys, ……, can you please stop fighting so disgracefully?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, he didn’t want Arisa to see the hideous quarrel between the Takasegawa family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is because he was concerned about the reputation of the house. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru also didn’t want Arisa to see him and his mother arguing, so he settled the matter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the other hand, Ayumi and Sayori continued to fight. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The food’s ready.”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After saying that, Arisa brought the food over and they stopped fighting.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, trying to at least help serve the food, they set the table.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Even so, …… you’ve put in a lot of work.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, I did. I got a little serious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru praised Arisa, she replied with her usual cool expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">&ndash;On the other hand, Kazuya, Ayumi, and Sayori were surprised to find that the food was more luxurious than they had expected.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” This is so…… I’m really sorry. Arisa-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Yeah, I lost. I was so rude to want to teach you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, wow, this is awesome.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya and Sayori apologized to Arisa, and Ayumi’s eyes lit up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The dishes that made the three of them have such a reaction was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">White rice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Miso soup with horse mackerel balls.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Japanese-style hamburger steak.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Horse mackerel, sashimi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Simmered eggplant.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chilled tofu.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And a strange, sticky, mysterious object.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa, is this the thing called ‘dashi’ in Yamagata?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked, pointing at the gooey things.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems to be a combination of small chopped okra, cucumber, shiso, ginger, and eggplant with noodles sauce.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. I made it to serve with chilled tofu. But it’s also delicious over rice.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After saying “Itadakimasu”, Yuzuru immediately took a spoonful of the broth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He poured it over the chilled tofu and brought it to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s delicious. It’s cool and refreshing, and at this time of year, something cold and sticky like this makes my chopsticks go faster.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">I think I can make this myself, so I’ll ask for the recipe later, Yuzuru thought in his mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even after the summer vacation had ended in September, the hot days will continue.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He felt that he could survive the lingering heat with this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This horse mackerel filet is good. …… makes me want to drink sake.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The hamburger steak is delicious. Very tender.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The miso soup is delicious. …… The fish has a strong flavor and no odor.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eggplant stew is also delightful. The simmered dishes made by Arisa are really delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya, Ayumi, Sayori, and Yuzuru all praised Arisa’s cooking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then her cheeks blush and she lets out a small voice as she lays face down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, t..thank you. …… oh, we have refills, if you’d like.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi and Sayori looked at each other when they saw Arisa’s gesture.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they chuckled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think I understand why Niisan has fallen so hard.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa-chan, you’re really cute. I want you to be my daughter. …… Ah, you will be, soon?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What are they saying?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru drank the miso soup with balls of fish, thinking inwardly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… It’s a secret that he felt a little embarrassed.</p>
