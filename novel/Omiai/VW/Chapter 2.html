<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Staying with Fiancée</h3>

	
	<p class="block_7">When Arisa and Kazuya contacted Naoki Amagi, he easily agreed to let Arisa stay out overnight, saying, “I can trust Takasegawa-san with my daughter.”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, with Sayuri accompanying them, they went to a nearby convenience store to buy the bare necessities such as underwear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since they had already finished their dinner at the festival, they decided to take a bath.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s my kimono. …… What do you think? Arisa-chan. Is the size okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes. It’s just right.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa answered.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What Arisa is wearing is the kimono that Sayuri uses as her nightgown.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not the kind of beautiful yukata that you would wear to a festival or on a sunny day, but a very plain azure-colored one with no pattern.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps it was because she had just finished taking a bath, but Arisa’s flaxen hair was damp.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her skin is slightly rosy and flushed, and she has a good skin tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe that’s why it looks a little …… or quite glossy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, Arisa replied, “It feels just right.” …… It seems to be slightly out of size.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The size of the chest, in particular, is not right.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It looked a little painful, and if she bent over, her cleavage would be visible.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Arisa didn’t seem to be that bothered by it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Rather, she seems to have accepted it as “that’s the way it is,” perhaps because she has not had much experience wearing kimono in the first place.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, Yuzuru. You go and take a bath next. In the meantime, we’ll listen to what Arisa-chan has to say about Yuzuru.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, yes. …… Arisa, don’t say anything too strange, okay?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I will properly protect Yuzuru-san’s honor.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The way she said it, it was as if she was telling Sayuri and the others that there was something unsavory going on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, as far as Yuzuru could remember, there was nothing that he didn’t want his family to know about.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru decided to take bath quickly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he got out of the bath and returned to the living room, he found that Arisa and the Takasegawa family were having a great time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, they were talking about Yuzuru’s past, while using the souvenirs that Arisa had brought with tea.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, Niisan. We were just talking about you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I can see that. What are you talking about?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sat down on the cushion next to Arisa and reached for the sweets in the center of the bowl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He removed the wrapping paper and brought it to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems to be a type of western sweet that can be eaten chilled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru raised his opinion of Arisa’s adoptive father, thinking that his sense of style was not bad.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he was talking about his abilities, not his personality.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yuzuru had always been a child who didn’t clean up properly. When he took out a toy, he would leave it all over the place. When he played a game, he would just leave it there.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” It took a lot of effort to teach him to put things away after he played with them. I would give him exaggerated praise for putting one toy back in the box.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” “Rightt~!” ” Kazuya and Ayumi said happily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Yuzuru can at least clean up after himself, they were probably talking about when they were very young, perhaps in kindergarten or just entering elementary school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s what all kids do, I guess. …… Is there a fun factor there?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked as he sipped his barley tea.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Kazuya and Sayuri looked at each other and smiled happily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’ve learned to clean up your toys, but you never cleaned up your room, did you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“He didn’t even let me clean my room, saying, ‘What I do in my room is my business!’. “</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… So what?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Somehow, he felt that he could read the direction of the conversation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Until a while ago, Yuzuru was the kind of person who didn’t take the time to clean up his own private space.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But now he was different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After he met Arisa, he started to clean his room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was wondering how you were ‘disciplined’ by Arisa-san you see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Even though I told him to do it, he still didn’t do it. But after his girlfriend told him, he started to do it. You’re making mom jealous.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Did Arisa-san tell you that you’re doing a great job cleaning up and that you’re a ‘good boy’ or something, Niisan?.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kazuya, Sayuri and Ayumi made fun of Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As expected, Yuzuru was embarrassed and a little irritated when he was told this much.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And when she looked at Arisa, who would have told them this story, …… she shrugged apologetically.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry. I mean, I didn’t mean to offend you. …… I thought I explained that Yuzuru-san is now so respectable that he cleans his room.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, it’s not your fault. It’s these guys who are to blame.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru consoled Arisa and then …… glared lightly at her parents and sister.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Nevertheless, it was true that he had not cleaned his room, and he could not argue with his parents on that point.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So……</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Hey, Ayumi, even you can’t clean your room properly, it’s a mess isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Nii, Niisan! You peeked into my room without permission!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I was just imagining. But from the looks of it, I think I got it right.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi’s expression got twisted.</p>
	
	<p class="block_7">She shook her head from side to side in panic.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s not right. It’s not messy!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then…… Why don’t you have Arisa and Mom check it out? Same-gender people should be fine with entering.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, no! It’s an invasion of privacy!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru and Ayumi were having such an exchange, ……</p>

	<p class="block_7">Arisa giggled and laughed pleasantly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Aaah! Arisa-san, you’re terrible! You laughed at me!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Fufu, sorry. I was just thinking that you guys are really close.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked very amused, but there was a hint of longing in her expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">By the time Arisa and the Takasegawa family had finished their time together, the clock had struck twelve.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru led Arisa to the guest room and pulled out a futon from the closet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry. I had to have it laid out for me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Don’t worry about it. You’re our guest, after all.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After he finished laying out the futon, Yuzuru asked Arisa,</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You know where the bathroom is, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, that’s fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If you get thirsty, you can open the refrigerator and drink some barley tea. …… Is there anything else you’re worried about?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru asked that, a hint of hesitation appeared on Arisa’s face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she looked anxiously at the ceiling and the lights.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, is there an …… orange light here?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Orange light? ….. Is it a nightlight? Somewhere between a bright one and a dark one.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, that’s it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa nodded her head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she confided in Yuzuru, looking extremely anxious and embarrassed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I …… hate the dark. I mean, I can’t sleep unless I have a nightlight. …… Do, do you have one?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t worry about that. Yes, there is one, and this is the remote control.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru gave her the remote control for the lights and also the air conditioning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa pointed the remote at the light and pressed the button.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The lights dimmed a bit…..</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it was bright enough that she could see her surroundings with the orange light.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Relieved, Arisa let out a small sigh.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Okay then, Arisa. Good night…… and if you need anything, just come to my room.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, I understand. Good night.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru waved his hand to Arisa and closed the sliding door.</p>
