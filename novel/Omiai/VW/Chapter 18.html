<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Fiancée and Matsutake Mushroom Cooking</h3>

	<p class="block_6">The game was cut short early, and Yuzuru and Arisa headed to a nearby supermarket.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They bought some of the necessary ingredients.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they headed back to their apartment. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the way back.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hm? ……is it raining.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A cold sensation touched his skin, and he looked up at the sky.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The sky was covered with dull, dark clouds.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shall we hurry a little?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, let’s.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa walked a little faster to the apartment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Fortunately, they were able to get back before it started to rain heavily. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s not going to stop for a while.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said as he looked out of the balcony window.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Five minutes after they ran into the room, it was already pouring.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I hope the train doesn’t stop or get delayed. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Might be better to be a little careful.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At worst, though, they could call a cab.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru can pay for it for her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa may be apologetic, but now that he has invited her home, it is Yuzuru’s mission to bring her back safely.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then, Yuzuru-san, please wait quietly here”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I’ve helped my mother a little too before. There may be something I can do, you know.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he tried saying that, Arisa shook her head from side to side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m very glad you feel that way. But I have my own way of doing things. Besides…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Besides?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If Yuzuru-san’s cooking skills were to improve, I would be in trouble. I’ll lose my position.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said, half-jokingly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a joke to say that Yuzuru’s cooking skills would get better ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But she seemed to mean it when she said that she would lose her position if her job was taken.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“All right. Then I will wait for you quietly.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Forcing himself to help would only get in Arisa’s way, so Yuzuru decided to back off at this point.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As usual, he could just help with the dishes.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">Then the time passed and …… </p>
	<p class="block_7">The time was 6 PM.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The meal with the lavish use of matsutake mushrooms was completed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The menu was as follows:</p>
	<p class="block_7">Rice with matsutake mushrooms.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Matsutake mushroom soup.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tempura of matsutake mushroom and shrimp.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Baked matsutake mushrooms in foil.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chawanmushi (steamed egg custard) with matsutake mushrooms.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Grilled single matsutake mushroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Steamed matsutake mushroom in a clay pot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Stir-fried matsutake mushroom and spinach.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And so on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">While the matsutake mushroom is the main ingredient, the menu is also colorful and nutritionally balanced.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……it is truly magnificent today.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I apologize for that. I got carried away and made too much.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said, scratching her cheek.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that she was a little overzealous in front of the matsutake mushroom, a luxury ingredient.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I’ll just eat the extra tomorrow. You’ve done a great job with this meal.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m glad to hear you say that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">They both put their hands together to express gratitude. (<b class="calibre1">TN</b>:<i class="calibre6">itadakimasu</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru reached for the soup first.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a slight scent of bonito broth and matsutake mushrooms.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The usual miso soup is delicious, but this kind is also good. It has a delicate and elegant taste.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you very much.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru praised her cooking, Arisa replied in an indifferent voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, her eyes were softened and her mouth was a little slack.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her skin was slightly flushed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was easy to see that she was embarrassed.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he reached for the matsutake rice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Matsutake mushrooms were the main ingredient, but other mushrooms such as shimeji mushrooms and maitake mushrooms were also included.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In his mouth, he could feel the strong aroma of matsutake mushrooms.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he started on the tempura.</p>
	<p class="block_7">he sprinkled some salt on the matsutake mushroom tempura to test it out and brought it to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… If I may say so, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, who had eaten matsutake mushrooms just like Yuzuru, said with a wry smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Matsutake mushrooms, they don’t taste very good, do they?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well….. it’s mainly the smell.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">So, they moved on to the next dish where they could enjoy the aroma.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was mushroom steamed in a clay pot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would have been more ambient if there was a sake cup. But unfortunately, there is no sake cup in Yuzuru’s house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So he poured the broth into a teacup.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm … this is good”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The shrimp broth and the matsutake mushroom flavor went well together.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He squeezed in a little kabosu juice and drank it, which changed the taste a bit and was also delicious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This time, he opened the lid.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Inside were shrimp, matsutake mushrooms, carrots, and other ingredients.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He took them out with chopsticks and put them on a plate and carried it to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is also delicious. The texture of the matsutake mushroom is different from that of the soup.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. …… Actually, after making the earthenware steamed dish, I thought I had made a mistake because it was covered with the soup, but it’s totally different.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, the soup stock is bonito broth, while the prawn broth is used for the earthenware steaming, so in a sense, it is natural that they taste different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After the rich flavored dishes, they decided to try grilled matsutake mushrooms.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was a very luxurious dish of large matsutake mushrooms grilled on a net.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hm…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… mushrooms right?.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, it’s a mushroom.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The flavor was “mushroom”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both Yuzuru and Arisa looked at each other and chuckled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Next, they tried mushrooms baked in foil.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This tastes better than grilled on its own.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, it does. I think it tastes better when it’s seasoned with alcohol or something.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Next was stir-fried matsutake mushrooms and spinach.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa made this dish because she wanted something green.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Butter and matsutake mushrooms go well together, don’t they?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, it does……. But I think the butter flavor was a little too strong. It’s something I need to work on.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The last dish was chawanmushi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He let it cool with a spoon before putting it in his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is …… delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It has a rich taste of shrimp and bonito soup stock.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The rich flavor of the shrimp and bonito broth and the elegant aroma of the matsutake mushrooms filled my mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The texture on the tongue is also very good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think this might be my favorite out of all of them.”</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“I’m glad to hear you say so……. I’m good at making chawanmushi.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was also confident.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She smiled happily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After that, the two of them prioritized things that would not last long or would not taste good once they were cold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they wrapped up and stored in the refrigerator those items that could be eaten if reheated, such as soup.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Finally, the two of them worked together to finish washing the dishes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then …… Yuzuru looked out the window.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The rain and wind were getting stronger, and it didn’t look as though they could make it to her home.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is a problem…….. Do you want me to call you a cab or something? I can pay for it if you need it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I would feel guilty about that, and Yuzuru-san doesn’t have a lot of money to spare either. ……”<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">At that moment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a moment of flash outside the window.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was followed by the sound of the sky cracking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And then ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Kyah~~!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Whoa!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru yelped as Arisa pushed him down.</p>
