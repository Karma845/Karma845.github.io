<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Study Session with Friends</h3>

	<p class="block_6">“You know. I think it’s weird to study before a mock exam.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It had been an hour and a half since they started studying.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka suddenly started to say something like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, Ayaka. Who is the one who organized this gathering today?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro asked Ayaka in a slightly exasperated voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka tilted her head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s me, though?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What was this gathering about?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a study group.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“─ Don’t deny the reason for holding the gathering that you yourself organized.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro gave a plausible prodding.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, Ayaka restrained him with her hand, “Well, well, listen to what I have to say”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The purpose of mock exams is to find out where you stand, right? That’s why it’s important to study daily. It doesn’t matter if you do a little bit of studying right before the exam and raise your score by a few points.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think that’s the kind of thing that a kid who’s been studying hard regularly would say,…… not a kid like you who’s usually doing nothing but sleeping in class.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Ayaka smiled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But I was the top-ranked student in the school last time too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, I can’t say anything back about that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, Yuzuru is not a serious student either, he is only trying to understand the content of the class, so he can not say anything about others.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“As expected of, Ayaka-san! It’s exactly as you said! It’s useless to struggle now! Let’s stop now!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Chiharu, you should study……. Your parents got angry at you right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro forcefully grabbed Chiharu’s shoulders as she stood up as if to agree with Ayaka and made her sit down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe because she lost her concentration a little <span class="calibre5">bit, Arisa</span>, who had been studying properly without saying much, put down her pen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she spoke up with a question.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But this mock exam is more important than the last one, isn’t it? The name of the test is also ‘High Difficulty Test’.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The questions would be more difficult than the last one…. or so it was advertised”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru agreed with Arisa’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Following that, Soichiro, who sat back down next to Chiharu, continued.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve heard that it’s hard to raise deviation scores. Because the group of people who take the test is higher.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Tenka, who was drinking a cup of tea, raised her eyebrows.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think it depends on the questions that are given, though. If the examiners make a mistake and only give problems that no one can solve, the deviation score may go up for some people.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At that moment, someone let out a big sigh.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You guys are going deviation this, deviation that…… are you all deviation people? How can you talk about such boring stuff at a time like this?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s only for you, Hijiri-kun. I’m having fun, okay? with Deviation. Because I did well in the last mock exam. It’s terrible right. I feel sorry for you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Excuse me, Tenka-san. It’s critical for me too, so can you please stop?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka incited Hijiri, and Chiharu was injured by a stray bullet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Meanwhile, Hijiri was raging against Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shut up. Be a little considerate, you know considerate. There are people in this world who don’t like the word “deviation,” and people who don’t have anything to do with it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chiharu also agreed with him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. Do you know why school is boring, but school romance stories are interesting? It’s because they cut out the classroom scenes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Unfortunately, however, Chiharu and Hijiri are not people who are immune to the word deviation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, considering the results of the last mock exam, they need to be very aware of it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, this meeting is a ‘study session,’ you know. You two in particular need to take this seriously.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, they both sighed loudly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they glared at Yuzuru with fierce eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You know people won’t like you if you keep talking straight.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Please stop the logic harassment.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa tugged on Yuzuru’s clothes with a cute little motion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And she put her alluring lips close to Yuzuru’s ear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ……If they think it’s the right thing to do, why wouldn’t they do it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Probably because it’s more trouble than it’s worth …… That’s the same reason I never cleaned up.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru himself thought, “I need to clean ……,” but he didn’t really put his mind to it until he got into trouble with Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In short, it’s a matter of crisis awareness and triggers.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, they’ll get serious when they fail.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Isn’t it too late once you fail ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But I heard that more than half of the students in our high school are ronin”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Huh? …… Is that so?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Apparently the teachers don’t stop them even when they’re about to fail.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Wow. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, as it is now, Hijiri and Chiharu are on that course. We’ll use that as a lesson ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I hear you.” “I can hear you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Today was supposed to be the first time that Chiharu and Hijiri had actually met. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that they have become friends without knowing it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru shrugged his shoulders.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I know I’m getting off track here, but what I’m trying to say is that I want to play. We’ve got so many people here!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If that’s the case, why don’t you call it after the mock exam? ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru prodded her, Ayaka’s cheeks flushed and she began to squirm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Because Tenka-chan and I have no connection at all. I was wondering if she would come if I suddenly asked her to play with me. Right, Tenka-chan.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka then laid her own head on Tenka’s shoulder.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“E, eh …… I guess.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka was bewildered by Ayaka’s antics. </p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that even the cool girl tends to get pushed around a little by Ayaka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sipped his tea and thought a little about the combination of this group.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are a few people in this group that he knows indirectly, but doesn’t usually have much contact with.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are also a few people who have met each other before but are not that close.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Yuzuru, the one he doesn’t have much contact with is Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Arisa, it’s Hijiri, Tenka, and Soichiro.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Soichiro, it’s Tenka and Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Ayaka, it is Hijiri and Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Chiharu, it’s Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Hijiri, Ayaka, Chiharu, and Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Tenka, it’s Yuzuru, Arisa, Soichiro, and Ayaka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s how it is.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So playing to deepen friendship is not a bad idea.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Although it is a little different when you ask whether it is something to do at this time of year.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Regardless of whether you want to play or not, it’s almost lunchtime, isn’t it? How about we take a break for a while?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Arisa who suggested this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It might not be a bad idea to take a lunch break at this time, since everyone’s concentration is starting to wane.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s a good idea! Then let’s order something to be delivered.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With Ayaka’s approval, it was decided to take a lunch break.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The question was what to order for delivery. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s comment that she had never ordered pizza delivery led to the decision to order pizza delivery.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think Arisa.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked Arisa as she carefully ate her pizza, trying not to drip cheese down her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At first glance, it was hard to read her emotions, as she maintained her usual cool and calm demeanor.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Mmm…… It is delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her voice sounded slightly melting.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her jade-green eyes, usually dark and lifeless, now lit up with light.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was …… a little, no, a lot cuter in these situations.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Arisa-san is quite cute, isn’t she?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Chiharu suddenly said that, Arisa had a puzzled look on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chiharu, who was sitting just in front of Arisa, gave her a rather dangerous smile and stared at her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Usually you seem to be the cool type, but suddenly show your cute side. I can’t get enough of it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is, is that so……. Thank you very much for that…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe because she did not know what to say,</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa thanked Chiharu.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Ayaka interrupted the conversation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Speaking of cool types, you’re pretty cute too, Tenka-chan!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was eating her pizza with an attitude of indifference, when her name suddenly came up, causing Tenka to shout in confusion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka, who was sitting by Tenka’s side, closed the distance between them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Tenka-chan is mostly tsun tsun, but sometimes she’s a bit of a dere, isn’t she? Also, she’s shy. Oh, your face turned red. You’re so cute!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, ……, stop it. Tachibana-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I told you that you can call me Ayaka. Right, Tenka-chan.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka blushed in embarrassment as she tried to keep her distance from Ayaka, who came at her aggressively.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This kind of attitude seems to incite Ayaka’s curiosity more and more.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She tries to close the distance even further, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t do that!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It hurts, it hurts! Soichiro-kun!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro grabbed Ayaka by the neck and pulled her off.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Soichiro glared lightly at Chiharu as she tried to get close to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chiharu’s face twitched, and she sat back down on the sofa quietly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… What Hijiri.? What’s with that face?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I didn’t realize that even the intimidating Tenka-sama had her weaknesses. Cute, cute Tenka-chan…… Ouch! You kicked me, you bitch!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shut up, yakuza.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“A~a? I’ll crush you, you fraud!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri and Tenka began to quarrel with each other.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The remaining five watched them with warm eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They seem like a close couple.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Speaking of which, what are we going to do after we finish eating?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka suggested, assuming that they were going to play.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But, Yuzuru was not in the mood to study right now either.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He wanted to relax and play, considering that he’ll be sleepy after lunch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How about a big game brawl?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chiharu suggested, but Ayaka shook her head from side to side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I would love to do something like that, but I don’t have enough controllers for seven people.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then why don’t you just play cards or something safe? If it’s a card game or a millionaire game, everyone knows the rules at least.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru suggested that……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Ayaka frowned.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“E~e, it’s too safe and boring.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that so …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s indeed a little boring to have seven people gather together to play poker.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If anything, a game that makes use of the number of players is better.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How about the King’s Game?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">And that’s when a decent idea came out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s a great game for deepening friendship and making the most of a large group.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The King’s Game. …… yeah, that’s a good one.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The King’s Game! That’s good!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka and Chiharu agreed with Soichiro’s opinion …… and looked at Arisa and Tenka for some reason.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them tilted their heads puzzledly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Just so you know, Ayaka, Chiharu. Keep in mind that you too may be ordered around.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru pegged Ayaka and Chiharu not to give any reckless orders.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri, on the other hand, smiled with amusement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s good. It’s a game of kings, with the possibility of retaliation.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At least everyone seemed to be on board.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka immediately drew up a lottery for everyone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ” “Who’s the king?” ” “</p>
	<p class="block_7">The game has begun, a test of good sense and playfulness, a true expression of human nature.</p>
