<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; Fiancée and Birthday</h3>

	<p class="block_6">It was mid-October, in the depths of autumn.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Yuzuru’s birthday.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Therefore, Yuzuru-san… I’ve baked a birthday cake for you. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When they got to the house, Arisa handed Yuzuru one of the two paper bags she had brought with her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a little bit of a sweet smell to it, so Yuzuru knew it was probably a cake. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Baked it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Who did?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I did.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s eyes widened in surprise at this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In all his life, he had never eaten a homemade cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In Yuzuru’s house, cakes are usually purchased.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I feel guilty about this somehow.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, Yuzuru-san has always taken care of me. …… the other day, too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, oh, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The other day.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa ‘stayed’ at Yuzuru’s house for the night.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, the next day, he was treated to breakfast as a reward for his hospitality. So from the point of view of Yuzuru, she had already returned the favor.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, anyway. Since we’re already here, can I have it now?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After receiving permission from Arisa, Yuzuru opened the paper bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Inside was a refrigerant and a paper box.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He took out the box and opened it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh …… It looks so authentic.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What was inside was a chocolate whole cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The size of the cake was a little too big for two people to eat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If there’s anything left over, he can always eat it tomorrow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru brought a knife from the kitchen and cut the cake into pieces.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He prepared coffee and put his hands together.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then, Itadakimasu”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He cut the cake with his fork and brought it to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The rich and elegant taste of chocolate spread in his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s delicious. It goes well with coffee.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru praised her, Arisa looked away slightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her cheeks turned red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that so… Thank you very much ……. Well, I guess it doesn’t taste as good as the professional ones on the market.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t think so. I’m sure it’s on the same level.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s probably because I adapted it to Yuzuru-san’s taste. I thought about eating it with coffee, and I wondered if Yuzuru-san would like this kind of taste. I’m glad you liked it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Professionals make their products as products, so they try to make them as palatable as possible to the masses.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the other hand, Arisa was fine as long as Yuzuru thought it tasted good, so she adapted to his taste.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is the reason why, although Arisa’s skills are inferior to the professionals, her impressions of the food are comparable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">……It was like one of those tangents.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, there you go again. That’s perfectly satisfactory…….. You know exactly what I like.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He has been alive for sixteen years now. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Yuzuru doesn’t know himself well enough to be able to verbalize exactly what his tastes are. Yet,</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’ve been together for over six months now.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa smiled at him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but scratch his cheek.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She remembers what he likes, and she cooks for him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Though he is very happy with that ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">He’s afraid that he might get the wrong idea.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(No. …… It is not good.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘I must not fall in love with Arisa.’</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru believed so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is a line that must be kept if they are to remain “engaged”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Why don’t you eat too?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I guess so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">To disguise his mixed feelings, Yuzuru suggested this to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa also picked up her fork and brought it to her mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think? How does your cake taste?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s an eight.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Not a perfect score? That’s harsh.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Of course, I gave it my best. But …… I think there was room for more improvement.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It tastes good enough as it is now.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it seems that Arisa is aiming to improve the taste even further.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t work too hard, okay? I think you should relax a bit more.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, it’s also a problem if she’s as random as Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Arisa is being overly cautious in many ways.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a little bit different from …… trying your best.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How is it different?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s fun to cook for you, Yuzuru-san. It makes me happy to make you happy. That’s why …… it doesn’t make me feel like I worked that hard.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, if you say so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If she was enjoying it, and if she was taking proper breaks, there was no reason for Yuzuru to stop her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, it’s not good if it becomes the norm and is enforced halfway.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why he plans to keep telling Arisa that she doesn’t have to take it so seriously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. Yuzuru-san ……, I have prepared a birthday present for you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said and took out a beautifully wrapped box from the other paper bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was decorated with a pretty ribbon.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, it’s not much…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you……. Sorry to have you prepare a cake and a present for me. Can I open it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Please.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru carefully removed the wrapping and ribbon and opened the box.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What emerged from inside was……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“A bracelet?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a stylish bracelet made of a braided leather cord.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He could tell at a glance that it was quite elaborate.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yes… Well, I thought about buying something, but I couldn’t think of anything. I asked Ayaka-san for advice, and she said the best thing to do was to make it by hand. Well, it may be lousy, but what do you think……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru didn’t immediately respond to Arisa’s words but tried to put the bracelet on his left wrist where the watch was fitted.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although he’s a bit obsessed with watches and is confident that he wears a good watch……, the design of the bracelet seemed to fit that watch well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s pretty cool, and it matches Yuzuru’s taste.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you. I like it. I’ll wear it from now on.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru replied, and Arisa breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, …… she still looked somewhat worried.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ok…….I’m glad you liked it, but, you know, it’s not a very good piece of work. If you don’t really like it, you don’t have to force yourself to wear it. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru reached out his hand to Arisa’s anxious head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He gently stroked her flaxen hair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her beautiful jade green eyes drooped slightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“There isn’t a man in the world who wouldn’t be delighted with your handcraft. I’m a lucky man……. I’m really happy.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Yes. Thank you very much.”<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa squinted her eyes in comfort.</p>
