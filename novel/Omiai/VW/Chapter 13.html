<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Fiancée and Winter</h3>

	<p class="block_7">As it was already getting dark, Yuzuru decided to walk Arisa to her house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them walked side by side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was hot in the daytime, but it was a little chilly at night, as it was already the beginning of autumn.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps it was because the difference in temperature between day and night was surprising to them, and perhaps it was because they were wearing cool summer clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you okay, Arisa.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It felt a little cooler for Yuzuru, but Arisa looked a little chilly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he called out to her, Arisa showed him her arms holding her body.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m not very good with cold weather, you know.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Even though you’re in Yukishiro.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Yukishiro means Snow Castle</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It is just that I have snow in my last name, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa then gave a small laugh.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, she was not lying when she said she is not good with it, because she really looks a little frigid.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe it was the fact that Arisa was wearing clothes that seemed to have a lower cold tolerance than Yuzuru’s.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whatever it is, it would be bad to catch a cold by getting her body cold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After thinking about it for a while, Yuzuru grabbed his jacket with both hands and lightly tugged on it as he asked Arisa,</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shall I lend it to you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh?　…… But isn’t it cold for you as well, Yuzuru-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Allow me to be a little cool here.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru answered that, Arisa replied, “Then let me take your word for it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He took off his jacket and handed it to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She carefully slipped the sleeves on, trying not to crease them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The jacket completely covered Arisa’s body.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s warm……. Are you okay Yuzuru-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Better than you were just now, yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He felt as if the temperature he was experiencing had changed from cool to slightly cold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it was not unbearable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Really…..Thank you so much “</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa squinted her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she turned her gaze to her feet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t like winter.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Because it’s cold?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah… And there was no one to lend me a jacket when I was shivering.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Does that mean that there was no one to help her?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or did it mean something else?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru didn’t know.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But this winter, I might be able to like it a little……. I have a feeling.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Okay, then let’s try to make you like winter……. but there’s still over two months to go.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s only the middle of September.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">So it’s a little early to be talking about winter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Speaking of which, Yuzuru-san. I know, it’s probably not a good idea to ask these things, but ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Three sizes?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Not that!!…… You see, you paid for my coat. So, I was wondering how your financial situation is …… Are you not straining? Yuzuru-san’s allowance is also limited, and if it is your parents’ money, then that is a regrettable thing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although he wanted to say that she didn’t need to worry about it, Arisa is a girl who cares about these things.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru has never talked about his finances before. But if they are going to continue their relationship, it would be best to let her know.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“My parents pay for my utilities. They also pay for my clothes, because they don’t want me to look shabby”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As for the clothes, he keeps the receipts and claims them later.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, since Yuzuru’s parents tend to be a little bit lax in their spending, the bill is a little bit of a loose end.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><br class="calibre7" />“What about food?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Fifteen thousand yen, at least, to make sure I don’t starve to death. In addition to that, I have 5,000 yen for spending.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… That’s surprisingly less.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I can’t complain since I’m being allowed to live alone out of selfishness.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it is a little difficult to cover the cost of food and recreation with 20,000 yen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The rest is part-time money.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, you’ve been working?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, ……, I never mentioned it before.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru only goes to club activities once a week.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Aside from Saturdays for Arisa, he is off five times a week.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He doesn’t have any hobbies that he’s particularly passionate about, so he spends his free time working part-time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s admirable that you earn your own money.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said in a voice that sounded like she was honestly impressed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As for Yuzuru, he was happy to be praised by Arisa, but at the same time, he had some mixed feelings …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, no, well ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was thinking, maybe that wasn’t quite right what you said just now.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru stammered, Arisa tilted her head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t work out of necessity, I do it because I have time. It’s a hobby. I can quit anytime I want.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the first place, living alone is selfish on Yuzuru’s part.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He is allowed to do so because his family is reasonably wealthy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The main purpose of a student is to study, right?　That’s why I think that …… part-time jobs and club activities should be secondary unless it’s out of necessity or to make a living in that field as a professional. If the parents are alive and well, the child should study properly.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… But you’re managing to balance your studies, aren’t you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Indeed, Yuzuru’s grades are not bad.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And It’s not that he’s neglecting his schoolwork because of his part-time job. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But I’m not putting all my energy into it. …… I think I should be taking my studies properly and seriously, just like you. Well, …… this is just my personal opinion.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Can I ask you a question?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…. If you think so, why don’t you do it ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a natural question.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Unless you’re working part-time because you think it’s great to earn money for yourself, it would be weird to work part-time while thinking it’s not a good idea.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, …… there’s a good reason for that, in a way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Because I’m not a good boy, you know. I am a bad kid…… Studying is a boring thing to do. And while the main purpose of a student may be academics……, I believe the main purpose of life is to enjoy hobbies.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However ……., there is another reason why Yuzuru is working part-time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is because, for Yuzuru, his future is almost decided.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If things go in order, Yuzuru will inherit his parent’s job and the governorship of the Takasegawa family……. In other words, he has practically no freedom of choice in his profession.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The only time Yuzuru can be free is when he is a student.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is the reason why the parents approved of Yuzuru’s part-time job as a hobby.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re certainly not a good kid.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa replied when she heard Yuzuru’s answer.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but chuckle.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I wish you had denied that part.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I like that about you, you know?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa giggled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s heart skipped a beat.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">While they were talking, they reached the vicinity of Arisa’s house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Should I accompany you home?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally, Arisa would have replied, “I’ll be fine from here”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… can you accompany me today, please?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Somehow, she wanted him to take her to the front of the house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, it’s only a five-minute walk, so it’s no trouble at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru followed her to the front of Arisa’s house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve come all this way. Can I say a few words of greetings to your parents?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sure. ……, but I don’t think my adoptive father is around at the moment.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After Arisa said that, she rang the intercom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, in a slightly apologetic voice, she spoke to the person on the other end of the intercom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s Arisa. I’ve just returned……. Could you please open the door for me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A few moments later, the door opened somewhat violently.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s body trembled with fear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The woman who came out was a middle-aged woman with a rather unhappy expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Emi Amagi, Arisa’s foster mother.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Geez, neglecting the chores until this late at night!　You’ve been quite rebellious lately. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry. It was me who dragged Arisa-san around until late.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru stepped forward as if to protect Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he gave a small bow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And then he put a social smile on his face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is …… Takasegawa-kun. Thank you very much for hanging out with our daughter.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Emi Amagi seemed to falter for a moment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And she said it to Yuzuru with a vexed look on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(…… If you don’t like Arisa, why are you against marriage?)</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that Emi Amagi is not in favor of Yuzuru and Arisa’s marriage proposal.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But she seems to have a particular dislike for Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And she was the one who slapped Arisa on the cheek at the marriage meeting.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, if she hates Arisa, she shouldn’t really care if Arisa marries Yuzuru or not.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t understand her at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But he didn’t even want to understand it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I enjoyed it too. I was the one who kept her up late ……. I’m really sorry. Please don’t blame Arisa-san for that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said this to Emi Amagi, she frowned.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, she could not continue to scold Arisa even after Yuzuru told her so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa, come in.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ye, yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Emi did not respond to Yuzuru’s words, but let Arisa in.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she closed the door somewhat roughly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Will Arisa be okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the way home.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he was a little worried about Arisa……, his phone rang.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a message from Arisa on the screen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">[Thank you for protecting me.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">[Can you please do it the next time as well?]</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_10">AN:</p>
	<p class="block_11">By the way, Yuzuru’s part-time job is</p>
	<p class="block_11">Customer service at a restaurant: 1,050 yen per hour</p>
	<p class="block_11">Private tutor (private contract): 2,000 yen per hour</p>
	<p class="block_11">Miscellaneous work at a lawyer’s office: 1,500 yen per hour</p>
	<p class="block_11">1,500 per hour. Well, I’ll describe the details a little later in the story.</p>
	<p class="block_11">By the way, the chores at the lawyer’s office were actually done by a friend of mine when he was a university student. When I asked him if high school students could do it, he said that it was just a job for a patsy, so as long as they understood the duty of confidentiality, they could do it.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Since he works so hard, Yuzuru has a small amount of money for a high school student.</p>
	<p class="block_2"></p>
	<p class="block_11">True Dere degree: 10 -&gt; 20%.</p>
	<p class="block_11">It jumped up.</p>
	<p class="block_11">At the moment, she’s thinking, “If I marry this person, he’ll protect me.”</p>
	<p class="block_11">Marriage doesn’t seem to be a reality yet.</p>
	<p class="block_11">When it gets to a quarter (25%), it will change again.</p>
