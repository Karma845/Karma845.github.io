<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Fiancée and Cat</h3>

	<p class="block_6">The next day.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa came to Yuzuru’s house with a paper bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll be in your care today as well”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Ah!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru greeted back Arisa, he couldn’t help but gasp.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps because autumn is deepening and the weather is getting colder, …… Arisa came dressed warmer than usual.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Specifically, …… a very warm-looking knit sweater.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The cream-colored sweater clings to Arisa’s body perfectly, exposing her beautiful body lines.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is why her ample breasts come into view even if he does not want to take notice. It’s not that he dislikes them, of course, but they are a feast for the eyes. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But while the top looked warm, the bottom looked a little cold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s rare for Arisa to wear a mini skirt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her long, beautiful legs, covered in shiny black tights, peeked out from the short skirt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her legs are quite thin for a girl of her age.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it is not too thin and looks very soft with firm flesh.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Feeling a little nervous, Yuzuru took Arisa inside the house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, Yuzuru-san……. It is Halloween. So I made some sweets for you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa took out a pretty, wrapped plastic cup from a paper bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seemed to be a pudding.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I made pumpkin pudding. I hope it suits your taste.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you, Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru thanked Arisa and accepted the pudding.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa giggled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Actually, yesterday, I got sweets from Ayaka-san, Chiharu-san, Tenka-san, and Hijri-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I guess they gave them to Arisa too huh, those four.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He could understand Ayaka and Chiharu, but it was a little surprising that Tenka and Hijiri went to give sweets to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it is not that strange either, for although he was not sure about Tenka, Hijiri is not that bad at socializing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So Yuzuru-san got some too?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, yeah. It’s the same every year with Ayaka and Chiharu asking for sweets.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Those girls love such events.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not that Yuzuru doesn’t like them either, so he goes along with them every year.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see. …… I’m embarrassed to say I didn’t prepare anything.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, well, I guess that’s normal.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Not sure if it’s the same overseas, but in Japan, it is accepted as just a costume event.It’s not unusual for people to give each other sweets, but it’s also not unusual for people not to prepare them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But I feel kind of bad about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not so much that she feels guilty, but she does seem to care.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayaka-chan and Chiharu-chan didn’t tell you beforehand, did they? I think it’s because they didn’t want to force you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that so?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, they’re not going to force you to do anything.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Strictly speaking, they know who they can force and who they can’t.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They are more unreserved with Yuzuru than they are with Arisa, and they have caused more trouble than anyone else with Soichiro.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, Yuzuru and Soichiro have forgiven them for that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They only do things that are within the range of what can be tolerated.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If you’re sorry and want to give them sweets, you can do it next year.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, I do. …… If I were to forcefully return the gift, they would feel sorry as well.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that the decision was made in Arisa’s mind to prepare it for next year.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Yuzuru can only understand the feelings of his childhood friends Ayaka and Chiharu, as well as his friend Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He doesn’t know about Tenka because they haven’t known each other long enough.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Tenka, like Hijiri, seemed to have only given it to her for the sake of social interaction. …… Perhaps she did not expect a return gift.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe, that’s the case.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now, after receiving the pudding from Arisa, Yuzuru brought the return gift from the refrigerator.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a cake box from the usual pastry store.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The only difference is that this time the picture on the box is a Halloween version.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“As for me, ……, well, I’m usually preparing them, so it is weird to return this in return.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He placed the box on the table and opened it to show the contents to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa peeked inside and her eyes widened in surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I know about this. The kids in my class at school were gossiping about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Gossiping?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You have to wait in line to get one, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said, looking a little excited.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru nodded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, yes. I woke up early this morning and got in line to buy it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What Yuzuru bought was a limited sale Halloween cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is the only time of year that Yuzuru’s favorite pastry store sells a special pumpkin cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">Maybe Arisa will come with some Halloween sweets for me? </i>he thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So Yuzuru worked a little harder and bought this cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“S, sorry about this……. I only brought this amateur-made pudding. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’d rather get a compliment than an apology.”</p>
	<p class="block_11">If you want to apologize, you can just put the effort into praising me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said half-jokingly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa squinted her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, ……should I do ‘good boy, good boy’ routine?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eeh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but let out a strange sound.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa giggled, though her cheeks were slightly flushed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It was Yuzuru-san who said you wanted praise.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, that’s true, but ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If I ask permission beforehand, I can pet you, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He did indeed say something like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru himself had stroked Arisa’s head many times, so when Arisa told him that it was unfair that he didn’t let her pet him, he couldn’t argue.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t think it’s interesting for you to stroke my head.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I find it interesting though.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said and sat upright.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She then patted her soft thighs, which were covered by her tights.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Huh? But, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s my gratitude. Ayaka-san said that men like this kind of thing. Do you perhaps dislike it……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, It’s not that I …… dislike it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Looking at her beautiful legs, Yuzuru couldn’t help but gulp.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Honestly, he likes it a lot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though he knew it was not a good idea rationally, Yuzuru was defeated by the allure of it and rested his head on her lap.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then a soft lump of solid mass appeared in his field of vision.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The rich fruits were defying gravity and pointing straight up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Feeling that he would not be able to endure it rationally, Yuzuru decided to turn to the side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, he soon realized that this was a mistake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was because it was easier to feel the softness of Arisa’s thighs on his cheeks than on the back of his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">he could feel the base of the muscle, the soft fat covering it, and the immoral feel of the tights on his cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On top of that, the close proximity between Arisa’s skin and his own nose was not good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The scent of soap and the slightest hint of sweat gorged Yuzuru’s reasoning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you for standing in line so early in the morning for me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa began to stroke Yuzuru’s head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A tingling sensation ran through his body every time Arisa’s fingers stroked his hair and then touched his ears and the nape of his neck.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, …… I can’t do this anymore.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru rolled over and moved away from Arisa, as his reasoning was not going to hold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">&ndash;In the meantime, Arisa made a lonely sound.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I still did not do enough stroking.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m satisfied with that though.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru replied that, Arisa’s mouth turned into a pout in frustration.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Letting me pet you and then running away when you’re satisfied. …… You don’t have to act like a cat in that way, you know.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I never intended to be a cat in the first place.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was the one who had asked him to let her pet him in the first place.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt somewhat discontented.</p>
	<p class="block_11">True dere degree: 50% → 55%</p>
