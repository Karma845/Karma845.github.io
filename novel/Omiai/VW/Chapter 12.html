<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Fiancée and The Coat</h3>

	<p class="block_6">“This autumn coat is very stylish.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa looked at the price tag and ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her expression clouded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is it over your budget?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…. a little bit.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru glanced at the price tag.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa told him that this coat cost more than the money she had received from her adoptive father for her clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Well, it is indeed a bit expensive.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But the amount of money that is a little lower than that coat is…Yuzuru wasn’t sure if this was the right amount of money to give to a high school girl for clothing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The amount needed by men and women will be different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Considering the benefits that the Amagi family will gain from Arisa’s marriage to Yuzuru, one could say that they are stingy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although, consequently speaking, Arisa will never marry Yuzuru, so it may be appropriate.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How much money are you short?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru asked, Arisa stated the amount that was missing with a disappointed expression on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru thought about it for a while and then asked Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you like it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, more or less.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a hint of regret in Arisa’s expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If she didn’t like it that much, she would have given up on it outright.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The fact that Arisa is unsure about it means that she likes it a lot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you want me to pay for it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? but …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You like it, don’t you?　It seems to be a good one for the price. The next time you come back, it might be gone. As long as you give me my money back later, it’s fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As long as we are not real lovers, we can’t say “I’ll buy it for you”, but ……　</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not a problem if you lend a little money.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He trusts that Arisa is a girl who will pay him back properly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Fortunately, with the money he had saved from his part-time job, he can afford it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……if Yuzuru-san says so, ……then I’ll try it on and then decide. Please let me know your impressions.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, That’s fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru replied, Arisa took the coat in her hands without hesitation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, after asking the shopkeeper for permission, she put it on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… How do you like it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It looks good on you. I think it makes you look more mature.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The coat that Arisa liked was a caramel-colored trench coat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The design and color of the coat were a little more mature, but Arisa was originally a high school girl with an unmistakable style.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was able to wear it with no problem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Then I’ll buy it. Only because you are buying it, okay!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa reminded him of this, but she looked excited and put the coat in the basket.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They both headed to the checkout.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, ……, yes. Mind if I get credit points?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A few years ago, high school students were not allowed to have credit cards, but now, with the lowering of the marriage age, they can.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Holding the card in his hand, he asked Arisa, who gave a small nod.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After finishing the payment with the card, she received a paper bag from the clerk.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa squeezed the bag with both hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was able to make a good purchase. Thank you very much. I will return the money to you later.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah sure. …… Well, I’m not going to rush you. Just return it to me when you can afford it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said this, Arisa squinted her eyes and gave a small nod.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa seemed to be in a better mood than ever.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her eyes, normally as quiet as the surface of a lake in winter, seemed to have a warm glow in them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If she had “Ahoge,” it would be bouncing up and down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Ahoge: The antenna hair which is a character trait on some anime and manga like Rika from Chuunibyou</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was so cute that Yuzuru couldn’t help but reach out and pat Arisa’s head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At first, Arisa looked puzzled, but she soon squinted her eyes and left him to do as he pleased.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was like petting a dog, Yuzuru thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a strange noise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru looked up and looked in the direction of the noise. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Someone was running at a furious pace.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His back was quickly moving away from them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he came to, Yuzuru was frozen with his hand on Arisa’s head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked up at him, puzzled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, …… somehow, a person ran by.”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s dangerous right.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Maybe he had something urgent to do?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it was just a matter of a stranger running, and not related to Yuzuru and Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even so, continuing to caress her head…..was not something he could do.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, what to do next?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The texture of her hair was so good that he got carried away and started stroking it. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But It’s not a good idea to do this in public, Yuzuru quickly realized.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So he asked as if to change the subject.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa looked a little embarrassed, and her cheeks were blushing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, that’s right. …… Since neither of us has anything in particular we want to buy, how about we just go window shopping at random?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, it would be fun to just wander around without really thinking about the purpose as well”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The shopping mall is quite large, so there are places they haven’t visited yet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa started to walk around, trying to take a look around the place.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Simply looking around at the products.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That alone was surprisingly fun.</p>
	
	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xgf0Ccy/194751.jpg"></img>
	
	<p class="block_7">However, due to all the playing around, it was getting late in the evening.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So they decided to have dinner as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a diner nearby, and they walked over to it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t go to this kind of place very often,<span class="calibre5"> you know…… How about Yuzuru-san?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. …… I go with Soichiro and friends sometimes. And sometimes with my family.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Arisa widened her eyes, looking a little surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The fact that he went with his family seemed to be the point of surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I can’t imagine the Takasegawa family coming to a place like this.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I am aware that we are a strange family that wears kimonos all year round. But when we go out, we usually wear casual clothes, and we even go into random stores around here.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s mother, Sayuri, only cooks for weekday dinner and on weekends and holidays.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, when she feels it’s too much trouble, they will naturally eat out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since such occasions are usually sudden, chain restaurants that do not require reservations are very useful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And his younger sister, Ayumi, says, “The hamburgers at the family restaurant are better than my mom’s hamburgers”……</p>
	<p class="block_7">That is only natural.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If they can’t compete with hamburgers made at home, they can’t do business.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think I’ll have the demi-glace hamburger steak.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Partly because he was thinking about hamburgers, and partly because he hadn’t eaten a Western-style hamburger recently.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s order was immediately decided.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, on the other hand, seemed to be a little confused.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I can’t make a choice. There are so many dishes to choose from.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, take your time.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After a lot of hesitation, Arisa ordered the Doria. (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Doria &ndash; Rice gratin with white sauce and cheese)</i></p>
	<p class="block_7">After waiting for a while, the food arrived with a delicious smell.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru cut up the hamburger steak and put it in his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a familiar taste that he had eaten many times before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After all, chain restaurants give you peace of mind in that you can walk into any restaurant and get a reasonably good meal.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, it’s also fun to visit independent restaurants.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Eating half of the hamburger ……, he suddenly turned his attention to Arisa’s Doria.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seemed to have just finished a quarter of her meal.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Suddenly, his eyes meet hers.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she took out a new spoon.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She scoops up the part of the Doria that she hasn’t eaten yet and blows on it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Could it be ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">At the same time as Yuzuru came to his senses, Arisa held out the spoon.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You want some, right?　Go ahead.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“‘…… Then, I’ll indulge in your kindness.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru leaned forward a little and put the spoon in his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The rich taste of white sauce and cheese spread in his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it was a little embarrassing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it would be easier to have Arisa actually experience it than to say it out loud.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So Yuzuru stuck a new fork into the hamburger and stuck it out to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A slightly surprised expression appeared on her face, but Arisa immediately leaned forward and opened her small mouth to put the hamburger in her mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Mmm. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a slight hint of red on Arisa’s cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was also embarrassed, after all.</p>
