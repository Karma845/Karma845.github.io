<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Occupation of Classmate’s Parents</h3>

	<p class="block_6">Later.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was lunchtime, so Yuzuru and the others decided to have their meal together at a nearby coffee shop.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Psst!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After ordering their food.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Tenka saw Arisa’s face, she let out a small burst of laughter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She turned her face away, shook her shoulders, and let out a laugh.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Nagiri-san, can you please stop laughing? …… My feet hurt.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Crunch, crunch, crunch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa kept kicking Yuzuru’s legs so hard that one could almost hear the onomatopoeia.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a miffed look, she appealed, ‘I’m mad at you.’</p>
	<p class="block_7">As she could not hit Tenka, whom she was not very close to, her anger was directed at Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Look, Arisa. I’m sorry, but if I hadn’t asked Nagiri-san, you wouldn’t have been able to go pick the flowers.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…….I could have gone”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then why don’t you go now for once?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa looked away with an awkward expression on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that the fear has not yet worn off and she cannot go to the bathroom by herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Seeing the interaction between Yuzuru and Arisa, Tenka started laughing again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, she’s stuck in a loop.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(…… devilish woman, huh?)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt like he understood part of the reason why Hijiri had said that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not a very good personality, even if you flatter her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Most of all, Hijiri doesn’t seem to have a good personality either, so in a way, they’re a good match.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You guys seem to be getting along pretty well. Yuzuru.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sure enough.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Smirking, Hijiri asked Yuzuru</p>
	<p class="block_7">As expected, the excuse of “I just happened to meet her at the movie theater” would not work.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You look like lovers.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka’s eyes narrowed as she said this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The ladylike and mature atmosphere of the past has disappeared, and now she has a slightly evil smile on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’re not lovers.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s correct”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa denied it once and for all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Hijiri and Tenka don’t seem to believe it very much.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They both looked as if they wanted to say, in unison, “There you go again, talking like that”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… This is what it means to be a couple of similar people.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You two also seem to have a relationship where you go to the cinema together.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked Hijiri and Tenka</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, …… both of them seem to have decided that they could no longer hide anything.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They cowered their shoulders.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You know that Ryozenji and Nagiri are now in a business partnership, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Business, that’s a nice way of putting it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Business is business.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">To Yuzuru, Hijiri said as if to make a point.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, who seemed to sense something disturbing, asked Hijiri and Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What are Ryozenji-san and Naginashi-san’s …… parents’ professions?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them then replied with a blank expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’re in the staffing business.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Counselors, I guess.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The kind-hearted Arisa was easily fooled, so Yuzuru told her the truth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“In short, yakuza and cult.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ehh…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa put on a cramped expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she muttered in a small voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ……So that’s why my foster father told me to be careful. I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, they were both unhappy with the way Yuzuru and Arisa were talking about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">First, Hijiri voiced his complaint followed by Tenka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’re not a yakuza in the first place, because we’re outside the scope of the Anti-Violence Law. In addition, we have never done anything against the law. Don’t use a confusing term. It’s just a staffing business. Please be clear about that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Cult is a label, isn’t it?. I’d like you to stop using it. I admit it’s a new religion. We’re not doing anything shady at all, we’re a legitimate and healthy religious organization. It’s still minor in the Kanto region, but in the Kansai region, there are quite a few followers.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, yes. All right, all right, I’m sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both of them had stiff eyes, so Yuzuru raised his hands to show his surrender.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is an undoubted fact that Ryozenji is outside the designated scope of the Anti-Violence Law &ndash; that is, it is not a yakuza by strict definition. And it is also a fact that Nagiri’s religion does not act in an anti-social manner.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, but your place is pretty fishy. What’s legitimate and healthy? It’s so whitewashed.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s your place, isn’t it?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah? Are you trying to start a fight?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What? Do you want a fight? If it’s a fight, I’ll buy it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri and Tenka suddenly started to fight.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa were drinking tea and watching it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When the two were about to grab each other, Yuzuru stopped them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, whatever. So …… I’ve heard that Ryozenji is helping Nagiri to expand into the Kanto region too. Tell me the rest of the story.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru forced himself to change the subject.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Hijiri answered bluntly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You can understand what I mean. That’s why we’re together.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Am I correct in assuming that you are in a relationship?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">"No, that’s wrong"</p>
	<p class="block_7">They both said in unison.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then they frowned uncomfortably at the timing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I wanted to see that movie, but I thought it would be dumb to go to the theater alone. Besides, it’s a good deal for couples. So I took a chance and asked Hijiri-kun out. He just nodded his head and said yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s with the attitude? You were the one who goaded me by asking if I was scared to watch.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">There is a slight difference in perception, but it seems that the two of them are just friends of the opposite sex.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa agreed with each other by making eye contact that they would go with that setting.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So we have talked. Now it’s your turn, Yuzuru.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru replied calmly to Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We’re kind of the same. I was invited by Arisa. …… Well, I wasn’t goaded into it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was afraid to see it alone. I invited Yuzuru-san to join me. …… We are only friends.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa also replied in her usual calm voice tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka was convinced by Yuzuru and Arisa’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Hijiri was not so convinced.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you really just friends?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is there any element of doubt?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, ……, well, let’s just go with that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri seemed to have realized that Yuzuru wanted to hide something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that as a friend, he chose not to pry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sorry about that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru made a small apology.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As long as he told Soichiro, it might make sense to tell Hijiri, who is also his friend. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, he still wanted to deceive if it was within his power to do it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I don’t like to be made a fuss about it. Can you please keep it to yourself?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa asked Hijiri and Tenka to do so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They nodded in unison.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m not going to tell anyone about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t mention about us either.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both Hijiri and Tenka asked Yuzuru and Arisa to do the same.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Their relationship became one of sharing secrets.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that they could now avoid a situation that would spread to the school.</p>
