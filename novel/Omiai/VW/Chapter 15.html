<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Fiancée and Massage (Shoulder Course) </h3>

<p>After the gym festival.</p>



<p>&#8220;You look a little tired.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Arisa were in Yuzuru&#8217;s apartment room.</p>



<p>On the way from the sports field to Arisa&#8217;s house, they passed by Yuzuru&#8217;s apartment.</p>



<p>Since it was a good opportunity, why don&#8217;t we take a break in the room and then go home?　</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked her.</p>



<p>Arisa accepted the offer without hesitation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only done a little running, but &#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s somewhat exhausting.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just a couple of hundred meters at most.</p>



<p>Despite this, Yuzuru was feeling slightly fatigued.</p>



<p>But the reason is known.</p>



<p>It was because he was running a little too hard.</p>



<p>He was so happy that Arisa had waved at him that he had pushed himself beyond his limits.</p>



<p>It is a little embarrassing to admit though.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, Arisa. You waved at me &#8230;.., didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes&#8230;.. Should I not have done that&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I was happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru was a little relieved to know that Arisa had waved to him.</p>



<p>If it hadn&#8217;t been him that Arisa had waved at.</p>



<p>Or if all of my classmates, including him, were the target.</p>



<p>He would have been a little &#8230;&#8230; jealous.</p>



<p>(&#8230;&#8230; This is not good. I&#8217;m not even her lover.)</p>



<p>Yuzuru forcefully suppressed his strange possessiveness and jealousy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san also &#8230;&#8230; cheered me on, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, you were really energetic.”</p>



<p>Yuzuru was indeed watching Arisa running closely.</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t wave his hand, though, because he didn&#8217;t want Soichiro and the others to make fun of him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, &#8230;&#8230;, you must be tired as well. You should get some rest. I&#8217;ll make you a cup of coffee.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru went to the kitchen to prepare the coffee.</p>



<p>There was no tea service this time, and Yuzuru was also a little tired, so he added milk and sugar to his own cup.</p>



<p>When he returned to the living room with the coffee, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa turned her head in a slightly listless manner.</p>



<p>She was tapping her shoulder with her fist.</p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa, I made you some coffee.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8230;., thank you &#8220;</p>



<p>After receiving the cup from Yuzuru, Arisa blew on it to cool the coffee, and then pressed the cup to her peachy lips.</p>



<p>After a sip or two of coffee, she placed the cup on the table and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>Then she craned her neck again.</p>



<p>“Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are your shoulders stiff?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa reacted as if to say, &#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, turning her head and tapping her shoulder were half-unconscious actions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. Was it obvious?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yes&#8230;&#8230;.&nbsp; Are you prone to stiffness?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru asked, Arisa gave a small nod.　</p>



<p>Then she replied, touching her shoulders.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always had stiff shoulders. &#8230;&#8230; It gets worse, especially after exercise or long hours of studying &#8230;&#8230;. I wonder if it&#8217;s because of my posture?&#8221;</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Come on, I don&#8217;t think your posture is that bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t dare point it out to her.</p>



<p>The answer was obvious.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s gaze shifted to Arisa&#8217;s bountiful fruits.　</p>



<p>She was wearing a jersey on top, but the front zipper was not closed.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because she was wearing a thin gym uniform, but her breasts looked bigger than usual.</p>



<p>Wearing such a weight on your chest while exercising will probably make her shoulders stiff.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want, &#8230;&#8230; I can give you a massage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said casually.</p>



<p>After he said it&#8230;&#8230; he regretted it a little.</p>



<p>(No&#8230;.. I mean, would she like to be touched on the shoulder by a guy? &#8230;..I hope she doesn’t take it weirdly. &#8230;&#8230;)</p>



<p>He was a little worried that Arisa would pull away from him.</p>



<p>But his fears were unfounded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;re having a hard time&#8230;..I might not be good at it though &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Then I&#8217;ll indulge in your kindness&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said and took off the jersey she was wearing.</p>



<p>Then she turned around and turned her small shoulders to Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;.Excuse me then. Let me know if it hurts or feels weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said and placed his palms on both of Arisa&#8217;s shoulders.</p>



<p>You can see that Arisa is very slender when you grab her.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that she has no flesh.</p>



<p>The firm, soft, girlish softness was evident when touching it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m starting it&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru said and dug his thumb into Arisa&#8217;s shoulder.</p>



<p>Then there was a stronger resistance than he had expected.</p>



<p>He could feel her muscles stiffening.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm&#8230; &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa let out a vaguely amorous sound.</p>



<p>He could feel Arisa&#8217;s softness and warmth in his palm.</p>



<p>And &#8230;&#8230; a little bit of sweet and sour smell of sweat.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can go a little harder than that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, &#8230;&#8230;, that much is fine. &#8230;&#8230; An~, &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>He was just massaging her shoulders.</p>



<p>For some reason, Yuzuru began to feel strange.</p>



<p>The white, nape of Arisa&#8217;s neck was strangely appealing.</p>



<p>The thought of being able to reach out and touch the soft and tender fat lumps with just a few fingers made his body heat up.</p>



<p>He stretched his gaze from Arisa&#8217;s shoulder to a little bit in front of her. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>I saw Arisa&#8217;s pure white, legs.</p>



<p>She is sitting in what is called duck sitting or girl sitting. &#8230;&#8230; Her pure white legs are stretching out from the length of her gym uniform.</p>



<p>It would be very soft to the touch.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, &#8230;&#8230;, Mm&#8230;&#8230;, An~, &#8230;&#8230;, oh, &#8230;&#8230;, Ah, &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Arisa. &#8230;&#8230; Is there any other place you&#8217;d like me to massage besides your shoulder?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked Arisa to disguise his thoughts.</p>



<p>Then Arisa replied in a slightly glazed voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. &#8230;&#8230; Mmm &#8230;&#8230; can you do my neck?　And also at the base of the shoulder.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Ah, okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru reached for Arisa&#8217;s white neck.</p>



<p>Then &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hyah!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s heart leaped.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I was just ticklish.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see&#8221;</p>



<p>Once again, Yuzuru put his strength into his hands.</p>



<p>He gently and gradually applied pressure to release the stiffness.</p>



<p>And each time he applied pressure, whether it was tickling or feeling good, &#8230;&#8230; Arisa made a charming sound.</p>



<p>Yuzuru, thinking of his dog, continued to massage Arisa silently, as if he was working.　</p>



<p>He continued to massage her for about fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s all right now&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru let go of his hand, Arisa stretched widely.</p>



<p>Then she turned her shoulders.</p>



<p>And she turned around.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. My shoulders are lighter now. &#8230;&#8230; Shall I give you a massage as a thank you?&#8221;</p>



<p>He was grateful for the suggestion.</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s shoulders were also a little stiff, though not as much as Arisa&#8217;s.</p>



<p>So he wanted to take her up on her offer.</p>



<p>However, Yuzuru was not in a position to do so at the moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8230;&#8230; good. Or rather, I need to use the bathroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I see. I&#8217;m sorry I kept you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fortunately, Arisa did not seem to question Yuzuru as he headed for the bathroom.</p>



<p>Yuzuru went into the bathroom, leaning forward slightly. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha~a. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>He sighed heavily.</p>



<p>It took him a few minutes to calm down.　</p>
