<h3>Chapter 33 &#8211; Christmas Eve Plans</h3>

	<p class="block_6">Early December.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The results of two mock exams that had been conducted previously, the High Difficulty Mock Exam and the Third National Mock Exam, were returned.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Saturday of that week.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa sighed as they looked at each other’s report cards.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“We lost again, didn’t we?l …To Ayaka-san.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. …… That fellow is really something else.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both Yuzuru and Arisa were defeated by Ayaka.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, Ayaka was in first place in the school rankings, while Yuzuru and Arisa were in second and third place respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa gave Yuzuru a furtive glance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I mean, Yuzuru-san is ridiculous, too. …… especially in English.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I can speak a little English, to begin with. My dad and grandpa taught it to me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s grandfather is a mix of American and Japanese.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why he is fluent in English.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And Yuzuru’s father, who was raised by his grandfather, also speaks English.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With such a family background, it was inevitable that Yuzuru could speak English.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he is not a native speaker, so there will be some mistakes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even so, he is more familiar with English than other Japanese people, which is quite an advantage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s nice… I’m not very good at English.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Apparently so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa has been putting a lot of effort into her English studies, but her English grades were not good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, it’s not her favorite subject.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I look like someone who should be good at it, don’t I?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, you look like you can speak at least.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">There is a tendency for Japanese people to think that all Caucasians speak English.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s appearance makes her look like she’s good at English.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m a mix of Russian and French, so I don’t have a shred of English in me. I was born and raised in Japan, so I don’t know what people expect of me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I can only say I’m deeply sympathetic.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru had never had such a problem, as it was hard to realize his foreign roots without being told.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In that sense, he was quite lucky.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Speaking of which, Arisa…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Do you have any plans for Christmas Eve?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s high school has its closing ceremony on the 24th of December.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The school closing ceremony itself will be over in the morning, so…</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I have no plans for it. But … you’re right. If you have a fiancée, usually… you will be spending it together.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said with a slight blush on her cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her expression… looked as if she had feelings for Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">Dokin</i>, Yuzuru’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ever since the day he had talked to Kobayashi, he had been strangely conscious of Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru shook his head from side to side, trying to shake off the distracting thoughts.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is it okay to take it that you will be spending it with me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes. I’d be happy to.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa smiled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a very pretty, beautiful smile.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Would Arisa really answer that way even if there was no “engagement”?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Such thoughts flashed through Yuzuru’s mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, what do you wanna do about the place? Do you want to go on a date? An amusement park is a staple. “</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Amusement park, huh? It’s going to be really crowded.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, I guess so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that in places where there are a lot of people, they can’t spend too much time relaxing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I heard it’s supposed to be a day to relax with the ones you cherish, so let’s just have dinner at home.”</p>
	<p class="block_11">Someone you cherish.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a moment, Yuzuru felt a tug on those words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But having dinner at home would be too taxing on you…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t worry about it… I want Yuzuru-san to eat my home-cooked food.”</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">Dokun</i>, His heart skipped a beat again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but look away from Arisa’s beautiful eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, if you insist, I’d be happy to indulge in it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… By the way, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa called Yuzuru’s name in a somewhat serious tone of voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her jade eyes sparkled as she stared at Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What color do you like? … that, in a fashion sense.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Why would she ask such a question so suddenly?</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a moment, Yuzuru had his doubts, but …… soon came to an understanding.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was probably a Christmas present.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, Arisa is going to make something homemade again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Let’s see… If it is about ornaments, I think I like the fancy ones. Like the one you gave me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru showed her the leather bracelet that Arisa had made for him earlier.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was still wearing it today, along with his watch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The color is quite flashy, so it doesn’t look inferior to the watch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa lowered her eyes in embarrassment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But for clothes and such…, I like calm colors.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Calm colors?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah… By the way, why did you bring that up?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Half in mischief, Yuzuru asked Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa shook her head and hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It, It’s nothing! I was just curious!!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, who dismissed saying so…. looked very cute.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but reach for Arisa’s head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa didn’t brush it away but accepted it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He combed her silky, clear, beautiful flaxen hair with his hand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa squinted her eyes comfortably.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re mean. Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you mean?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You realized it, didn’t you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t know what <span class="calibre5">exactly it</span> is yet.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…please look forward to it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">And so they spent some time together like that.</p>
	<p class="block_12"></p>
	<p class="block_11">Arisa’s True Dere degree: 65% → 75%</p>
	<p class="block_11">Yuzuru’s Seriousness: 80% → 85%</p>
