<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Fiancée and Moonlight</h3>
	
	<p class="block_6">“Hm?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Late at night.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru suddenly woke up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He realized that his cell phone was ringing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Half-asleep, he looked at his phone and saw that he had received a message from …… Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">[I apologize for coming in the middle of the night.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">[I want you to come to the room where I’m sleeping.]</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what she had written.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I thought I told her to come over here if she needed me. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Did he forget to mention that?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru tilted his head inwardly and headed for Arisa’s place.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Careful not to wake his family, Yuzuru made his way to the guest room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s room was bright and the lights were on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he opened the sliding door, he saw ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hai~..! Ah, Yuzuru-san ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a shudder, she jerked her body ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then there was Arisa with a somewhat relieved expression on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong? Arisa. Did something happen to you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah you see, ……, I am not sure if I should be asking you for this kind of thing, but …….”</p>
	<p>Arisa’s cheeks flushed in embarrassment and she began to squirm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Through the slightly unraveled yukata, he could see her white skin and some of her undergarments.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but gulp involuntarily.</p>
	<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was wondering if you could, uh, accompany me to the bathroom……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Bathroom? Didn’t I tell you where it is?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was sure he told Arisa about the location of the bathroom near the guest bedroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe his explanation wasn’t clear enough.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or has she forgotten?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru tilted his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, no, ….. Well, I remember where you told me to go…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh”&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But, well …… I was scared. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Embarrassed, Arisa said as she lowered her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It might be difficult for Arisa, who can’t sleep without a nightlight on, to go to the bathroom in the dark by herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, a question suddenly comes to mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Why not turn on the light? he thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Before Yuzuru could ask her about it, Arisa attempted to make an excuse.</p>
	<p>“I’m not sure where the lights are. …… And I’m not sure if it would bother anyone if I turned on the lights too much. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So that was it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be a little difficult for Arisa to find the lights in the dark if she didn’t know the place &ndash; not the place, but the building.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The reason why she sent me a message on her cell phone was probably that she couldn’t reach Yuzuru’s room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was a lack of consideration on Yuzuru’s part.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry. But just to let you know, …… this room and our bedrooms are quite far apart, and there are multiple bathrooms. So as long as you don’t make a lot of noise, you should be fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The room lent to Arisa is a visitor’s bedroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the Takasegawa residence, there are several bedrooms and guest rooms for visitors.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And of course, there is a bathroom for visitors.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, oh …… yes, now that you mention it, you’re right. Sorry …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s okay, I should have explained a little better. Shall we go together?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru replied, and Arisa gave a small nod.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them walked to the bathroom, turning on the lights.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Sorry for the inconvenience.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After finishing her business, Arisa gave a small bow to Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seemed to be getting embarrassed now, and her face was bright red up to her ears.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, everyone has a weakness or two.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru comforted Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And now they returned the way they came, turning off the lights. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Gyiii……</p>
	<p class="block_7">The hallway made a slight creaking sound.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hi~e~yah!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa exclaimed outrageously and hugged Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seemed to be completely oblivious as she embraced Yuzuru’s body.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“O, oi, Arisa …….”</p>
	<p>Next, it was Yuzuru’s turn to be surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Suddenly, he felt something soft pressed against his arm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The dim light and poor visibility also made the senses even more sensitive to touch and stimulate the imagination.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well,…. there’s actually one….. more reason…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Reason?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You see, …… at first I thought I could do my best even if I was alone. However, when I thought that there was a certain atmosphere, I suddenly became afraid. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… atmosphere?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A question flashed through Yuzuru’s mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, he soon concluded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In short, Arisa is trying to say that this house has a haunted atmosphere.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I didn’t mean to lie, but, you know, I thought it would be rude to say something like this. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although he wasn’t really asking her a question, Arisa was trying to make up excuses.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa rarely lies……, but when it comes to her true feelings, she sometimes refrains from telling the other person out of “consideration”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And now, after all this time, I guess she feels guilty.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What a difficult character.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Atmosphere, huh? I never thought of that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, you know, about Yuzuru-san’s house……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But if you ask me, it looks like it’s going to come out. It’s an old house.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">(<b class="calibre1">TN: “</b>It” being ghosts or something similar)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru laughed at that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As for Arisa’s “lie,” perhaps it should be treat as a joke.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it is true that when Arisa mentioned it to him, he thought it was going to come out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s an old wooden mansion, so it has that kind of atmosphere at night.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s also true that they creak, as we just learned.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, it is a Japanese belief that old things are “possessed” by something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">it would not be surprising if there were a Zashiki Warashi or two. (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><span class="text_1"></span><i class="calibre6">Zashiki Warashi: please google it</i>)</p>
	<p>“Do you… do you think… do you think it’ll come out?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I’ve never met one in my life. I don’t think so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, I see. …… That’s good, then.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">That said, she was still scared.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She grabbed Yuzuru’s arm and wouldn’t let go.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(…… That’s not good. In many ways.)</p>
	<p>He could feel the softness and warmth of Arisa’s skin through the thin fabric.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This exquisitely stimulated Yuzuru’s instincts.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since it was dark, “Isn’t it permissible to touch her in the confusion?”, such an evil thought involuntarily crossed his mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And he couldn’t bear to leave the scared Arisa alone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the other hand, spending the whole night with Arisa was not an option.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Therefore……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa, why don’t we watch the moon for a bit and then go to bed?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……eh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru led Arisa to the porch, which was not too far from the guest bedroom.</p>
	<p class="block_7">From there, they could see the garden and the pond.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">And …</span>… the moon reflected in the pond.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a nice atmosphere, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, it is. …… It’s beautiful.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa gave a small nod as if agreeing with Yuzuru’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The garden of the Takasegawa residence is always maintained by the resident gardener.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why the scenery is so nice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I didn’t notice it during the fireworks, but …… it’s quiet, tasteful, and beautiful.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s eyes squinted as she said this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her flaxen hair shone in the moonlight, making it appear golden.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s reflection with the fireworks was beautiful, but Arisa in the moonlight was also stunningly beautiful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt his heart pounding a little in his chest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then again, …… this should make her a little less scared.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m pleased that you enjoyed it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Arisa faced each other and smiled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, in the moonlight, …… Arisa’s cleavage was visible.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru hurriedly looked away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa tilted her head curiously.</p>
