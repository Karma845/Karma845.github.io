<h3>Interlude 3 &#8211; Sister’s fiancée</h3>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Warning: Disturbing Content</strong></p>

	<p class="calibre7" />I first met that girl when I was in the fifth grade …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">Suddenly, my father told me that our family was going to grow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The new sister was a …… very pretty girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had beautiful, translucent hair and eyes that sparkled like jewels.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was about three years younger than me, but she stole my heart at first sight.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was the daughter of my mother’s sister.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, she was my cousin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I had heard that I had a cousin, but that was the first time I had met her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had lost her parents in an accident.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why she was entrusted to this house. …… That was the situation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I felt sorry for her and pitied her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I made up my mind to be kind to her as a brother.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When she first came home, she was …… a little selfish for her age.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although she was only in the second grade, she was a straightforward child who would say what she thought immediately.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that her parents, that is my aunt and uncle, had spoiled her quite a bit.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, …… she was not a bad child.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had good manners at the very least.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was also very caring and kind and took good care of my younger sister, who was her cousin and played with her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Above all, she had a wonderfully innocent and cheerful smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, …… my mother didn’t like her, her own niece.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was harsh to her at every turn.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every time she saw her, she would yell at her, scolding her for every little mistake she made.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whenever she saw her face, she would say that she was wasting food or that she was undisciplined.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Occasionally, she would speak ill of her dead parents.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If she showed the slightest sign of disobedience, she would slap her on the cheek, spank her with a flapper or a belt, and sometimes lock her in the closet.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Such “discipline” was always done when my father was not around.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My father was a workaholic.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was a man who only cared about his job, himself, and his family’s reputation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So if he saw my mother disciplining her, he would probably have tried to stop it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would have given him a bad name.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was not because he cared about his family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At least that’s what I think.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, my father was often away from home and rarely participated in raising the children.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So this “disciplining” of her was tolerated.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Somewhere along the line, she stopped smiling.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her beautiful eyes became cloudy and began to darken.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And she was always looking out for someone else’s mood.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wanted to help her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I asked my mother over and over again not to be so hard on her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I even covered for her when she was being “disciplined”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">By the time I was in the first grade of junior high school, I didn’t see her being disciplined anymore.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was relieved that I was able to protect her. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">………………</p>
	<p class="block_7">…………</p>
	<p class="block_7">……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I was not so sure.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One day, I had an incident where I unavoidably saw her skin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I apologized as quickly as I could, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">At that time, I was sure that I had seen it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I saw an unnatural bruise on her white skin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was nothing to it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The reason why I don’t see my mother “disciplining” anymore was that I had started to come home late after I entered junior high school and started to participate in club activities.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was being disciplined often without me seeing it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My voice did not reach my mother.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was just helpless.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So……, as a last resort, I put my trust in my father.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was never very good with my father.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I didn’t have much contact with my father, who rarely came home, and he wasn’t the kind of person who would actively participate in raising our child.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Besides, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wanted to help her on my own.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I didn’t want to rely on my father too much.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When I told my father that she was being “disciplined,” ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">My father was surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, he had really thought that she was doing well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The next day, my father came home early and talked with my mother for a while.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was struck by the hysterical shouting of my mother and my father’s cold response to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My mother, as expected, seemed to have some patience with my father.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a while, she was quiet.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it did not last long.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One winter day, after the club activities ended early, I came home to find …… her sitting in the garden in her underwear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was shivering, looking cold.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Are you okay? Did my mother do that to you again?　</p>
	<p class="block_7">I think I called out to her like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, she ……</p>
	<p class="block_11">Please leave me alone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She said, glaring at me with horrifyingly cold eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I had to go into the house to escape.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My sister told me later that it was still the usual trivial mistakes that made Mother angry at her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had been helping her mother with the chores since she was in the upper grades of elementary school, and she had made some mistakes that had angered her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But the anger she felt at that time was not normal.</p>
	<p class="block_7">No, the mistake itself was just a start. …… What my mother was angry about was something else.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My sister was so scared of my mother’s rage that she ran to her room, so she didn’t know exactly what my mother was angry about.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Just ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Liar.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Vixen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Bitch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Harlot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what I heard her yelling from time to time. …… That was the case.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I have no idea why my mother was so hard on her in the first place, so I had no idea what she meant by “harlot”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After that, I often tried to help her, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Things didn’t get any better.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, it seemed to be getting worse.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">As time passed, she became a junior high school student and I became a high school student.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For some reason, she began to avoid me, and I couldn’t talk to her well because I felt helpless to help her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">By that time, she had started doing most of the housework.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I asked her if it wasn’t too hard or if she didn’t mind. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">She just replied that she just liked doing it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My mother’s “discipline” of her also began to diminish.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As you would expect from a junior high school student, her body has grown in many ways.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had always been a very athletic girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I think my mother was subconsciously afraid that she would fight back.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However,…<span class="calibre5">… the sarcasm and bad language never changed.</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">By no means did my mother change her mind, but as a result, her violence against her was much less.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My father’s relationship with her was still the same, but not particularly different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Also, she and my sister seemed to get along …… reasonably well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The surroundings were the same as before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or somewhat improved.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In spite of this, I felt as if I was the only one who had grown distant from her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I didn’t want to stay at home, I thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I took the entrance exam for a university far away and started living alone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I told myself that she didn’t need my help anymore.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I made that excuse and ran away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">………………</p>
	<p class="block_7">…………</p>
	<p class="block_7">……</p>
	<p class="block_7">If I had known.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If I had known that she was being forced to accept an arranged marriage, I would never have run away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was told that she was given an arranged marriage and that she was engaged to be married.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I heard this when the summer vacation of the university was approaching.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man she was engaged to, was the eldest son of a family called the Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I had heard that name a few times before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is a famous family that has existed in Japan since ancient times.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The family has been prominent since the Meiji Restoration, and together with Tachibana, they have led Japan’s business and political circles.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Together with ‘Tachibana’, they demonstrated extremely strong leadership in the postwar reconstruction and economic growth period, and even today, they still have a strong influence at home and abroad.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They say that they have access to not only domestic Diet members and bureaucrats, but also to foreign capital and overseas politicians, especially in the political and business circles of the United States.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are many members of the Diet who are related to the Takasegawa family, and I have heard that they also make substantial political donations.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They were also an important business partner for my father.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was clear to me that this was a political marriage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, my father received a huge loan from the Takasegawa family and their related investors after the engagement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Summer vacation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After finishing the lectures and part-time jobs that I couldn’t miss, I rushed back to my parents’ house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Just then, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Luckily, or perhaps not so luckily, I bumped into her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was with a boy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As I approached them, I smelled a …… little bit of chlorine scent.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In her hands, she carried what looked like a bathing bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And she had a slight tan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her skin is white, and when she tans, it turns red very quickly, so it’s easy to tell.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was shocked to see her going to the pool with the boys, as she doesn’t like to show her skin to others.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But as an older brother, I guess I should be happy that she has someone to play with, even if it is a guy since she doesn’t seem to have many friends.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… However, for some reason, I was annoyed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I don’t like something about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A well-organized face and a well-grown appearance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was a boy with a mature appearance, with striking deep blue eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At first, I thought he was just a friend, so I was surprised when I found out he was her fiancée.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was because he was so young.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I had expected him to be an older working man since he was getting married, so I was a little surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When I talked to him, I got the impression that he was mature, calm, and cool.</p>
	<p class="block_7">No bad impression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His appearance and his attitude seem to be very good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe …… I could persuade him to change his mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If I told him about her situation, he might help me get her out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what I thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I asked him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘Are you really going to marry her?’</p>
	<p class="block_7">He replied, ‘<i class="calibre6">Where in the world would someone enter into an engagement without intending to get married?</i>‘ ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">He looked somewhat taken aback.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His words were somewhat sarcastic and irritated me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, he tugged on her sleeve ……</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">Isn’t that right?</i>　He asked as if to force her to do something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she whispered something to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she said that they were going to get married.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She said that she was confident that they would work well together.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s crazy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s just too weird.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A fifteen-year-old high school boy and girl get engaged for the convenience of their parents, and then say that they are ready to walk together as husband and wife in the future, without hesitation, as if it were natural.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Common sense tells me that this is not right.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There is no way such a thing can happen in modern Japan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She must have been coerced into marriage by my father.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She is thinking about him, and she is being forced to act.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And he must have believed in her performance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was natural for a boy of his age to get excited when a pretty girl like her told him that she liked him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If I told him what was going on, he would understand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I thought so and told him about her situation with all my heart.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But he didn’t believe me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, for some reason, he asked her for confirmation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had no choice but to tell him that she loved him because of her position. …… Even when I explained that he could not understand me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When I managed to get him to understand ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">As if he was sincerely curious, he asked what I was looking for.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Suddenly, …… my eyes caught sight of the watch he was holding in his left hand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a famous Swiss brand watch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a …… luxury watch with a minimum price of over one million yen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ah, this is the Takasegawa family. I thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">To him, she is probably the same as this watch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was convinced that he had used his financial power to force her to marry him. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">At first glance, he seems like a nice boy, but in the end, he is a member of the family that bought her with money.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was the same kind of man as my father who sold her out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He is an evil person who would not mind doing something like human trafficking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So, I made it clear to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Don’t force her into marriage.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If you love her, if you don’t want to make her unhappy, break off the engagement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I hoped for his slight …… conscience.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he countered in a calm tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he doesn’t buy her, she’ll just be sold to another man.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yes, he turned defiant.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was as if it was the fault of you guys who don’t have money.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he sneered at me as if to say, what can an incompetent like you do?</p>
	<p class="block_7">I tried to argue with him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I couldn’t find the words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the meantime, he got into a cab and drove away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After he left, I approached her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Are you okay?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Did you go to the pool?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Did they do anything bad to you?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Are they threatening you?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Do they have any weaknesses in you?</p>
	<p class="block_7">I’ll be on your side. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">I said all those words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, she said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s enough.</p>
	<p class="block_7">You can’t do anything, so don’t claw your way into my life.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s none of your business.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She shouted, tears streaming down her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she ran into the house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s right.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I’m still …… powerless to do anything about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I couldn’t leave her alone with her tears.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One day, I will definitely have to help her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what I thought.</p>
	<p class="block_8"></p>
	<p class="block_7">Sometime later, he asked her to go to a summer festival.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I really wanted to stop her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But she didn’t listen to my restraint and went out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She didn’t come back for a while.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A call came by phone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently ……, because the train had stopped, she had to stay at his house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Staying at a man’s house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Somehow, I felt nauseous.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was blue in the face. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">My sister shrugged her shoulders and said.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Arisa-san goes to that guy’s place every Saturday, right?</p>
	<p class="block_11">She’s a total commuter wife.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I didn’t know that story.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wondered if she had already fallen under the spell of that man.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wondered if she was being forced to do terrible things.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was heartbreaking to think that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The next day, she came back safely.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Did something happen?　</p>
	<p class="block_7">I asked, but she just replied coldly that it was none of my business.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I guess she doesn’t want to be touched.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her attitude told me that …… something had happened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I couldn’t help but worry about her.</p>
	<p class="block_8"></p>
	<p class="block_7">So I decided to stay at my parents’ house for the whole month of September until the summer vacation was over.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then I noticed something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My mother scolded her much less often.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally, my mother would have yelled and scolded …… when she came home late at night.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But all she does is say a sarcastic word or two.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Apparently, even my mother was afraid of Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Takasegawa is such a powerful opponent.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I can’t win on my own.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what I thought.</p>
