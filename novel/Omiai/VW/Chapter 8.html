<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Fiancée and The Movie Theater</h3>
	
	<p class="block_6">Yuzuru went to the station where they were going to meet, wearing his usual shirt and jacket, with his hair waxed and styled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa had already arrived.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was hot today, with some lingering heat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Because of that, Arisa has dressed a little light.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She wore a see-through blouse with a cloak and a long skirt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her transparent decolletage was dazzlingly white and beautiful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In her ears were stylish earrings.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was wearing a little makeup, and her lips, which had always been full and beautiful, were now even more glossy and sensual.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru inwardly tilted his head, wondering if it was just his imagination that she seemed to be getting more beautiful every time he saw her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Did I keep you waiting?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I just got here myself.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After exchanging the usual phrases, Yuzuru referred to Arisa’s fashion today while trying not to look at her chest, which was a little too distracting.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Today, it’s more feminine …… than usual.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru complimented Arisa, using a word he didn’t quite understand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, it looked very good on her, and it certainly made her feel more “feminine” than usual.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was glamorous, but not obnoxious.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s the impression he got.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it would be embarrassing to say it directly, so he blurred it with a vague expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you very much. Yuzuru-san is also very cool…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m grateful to hear you say so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">But unlike Arisa, Yuzuru’s fashion doesn’t look that different from usual.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he inquired with Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So what’s the movie about?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s this movie.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa then showed Yuzuru the screen of her smartphone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s eyes widened involuntarily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Oh wait, isn’t this a horror movie?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a horror movie that had recently gained a reputation for being scary.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you not a fan of horror?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I’m fine with it. …… Are you okay with it?　Before, you said you didn’t like the dark. I thought you were the easily scared type.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa shook her head from side to side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I guess. Scary things are a little…… difficult. I might not be able to sleep at night.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……If it’s so, then why?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru could not understand why Arisa chose to watch horror movies even though she was not good at it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Arisa replied as if to say, what are you asking me?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t people watch horror movies because they want to be scared?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s …… well, if you ask me, it’s …… true, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Horror movies are worthwhile because they are scary.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Some of them are B-grade horror films that are actually gags, but horror films are meant to be scary.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘Horror is not at all scary!’</p>
	<p class="block_7">If you are one of those people who say that, you will not be able to enjoy horror in its true sense.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“And the girls in our…… class said it was funny. I’m scared, but at the same time I’m very interested.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I thought you were the type of person who doesn’t ride on trends.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but think that Arisa seemed like a normal high school girl, which was unusual for her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa answered with a small smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s not that I don’t like riding on trends, it’s that I can’t. because of the family situation.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, that was a self-deprecating joke.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When she saw Yuzuru’s strange expression, Arisa hurriedly made up for it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Was it a good thing …… that she could now make a few jokes like that?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was a little lost in confusion, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, thanks to me …… or not, you’re going to get in on the trend this time.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes. Then let’s go.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them headed to a nearby movie theater.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sorry, It’s my first time in a movie theater. Do we need to make a reservation ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If it’s a popular movie that’s just been released, yes, but …… it’s been out for a while. I’m sure there will be plenty of seats.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said and went to the ticket machine in the hall of the movie theater.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since Yuzuru and Arisa are high school students, they can get a student discount.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That is the case normally…</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Apparently today is a day when couples can get a discount.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Arisa’s skin turned slightly rosy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be nice if she would stop being embarrassed like that because it would make it even more embarrassing for the other side as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s a better deal, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, I guess so.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Then let’s go with that. It’s more economical.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although Yuzuru is not troubled by money, it is wise to save money when you can.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them purchased a couple ticket together.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he pointed to the refreshment stand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Let’s just get a drink. Do you want some popcorn or something?　It’s before noon.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru asked, Arisa gave a small nod.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I want to try it. But I don’t want to miss lunch ……, so why don’t we share and eat together?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, that’s a safe bet.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Surprisingly, popcorn tends to get hung up in your stomach, so if you’re not careful, you’ll be in for a world of hurt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s suggestion was a good one.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There were three kinds of popcorn: salted, buttered, and caramel.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he ordered the popcorn, the clerk asked him to choose.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was fine with any of them, so he asked Arisa what she wanted.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then I’ll go with …… caramel.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He thought she would choose the caramel flavor, and sure enough, she chose the caramel flavor.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but chuckle at how adorable she was.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… What are you laughing at?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s nothing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru quickly covered it up and walked into the theater with Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A few moments after taking a seat, a warning video came on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“uw~a, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong, Arisa?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked in a whisper to Arisa, who let out a small voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t like that …… thing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa frowned at that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The image on the screen is the famous “The Movie Thief” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b>Anti-piracy warning I suppose).</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, it’s not exactly pleasant to look at, is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">To be honest, Yuzuru doesn’t like it much either.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s probably more effective, though, because it’s an image that incites fear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I hope the movie is scarier than this movie thief.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I’m not going to be able to sleep.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said with a blue face.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was already shivering.</p>
	<p>‘You’re the one who chose horror.’</p>
	<p>Yuzuru thought inwardly as he popped the popcorn into his mouth.</p>
