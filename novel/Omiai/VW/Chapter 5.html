<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; First Time with Fiancée</h3>
	
	<p class="block_6">‘I’m so sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After breakfast.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After breakfast, Yuzuru was alone with Arisa in the guest room where she had been assigned and bowed his head with his knees folded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry that we had to force you to cook.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, no, Yuzuru-san. You’re overreacting. Please stop.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A neat face suddenly appeared nearby.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa looked at Yuzuru’s face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru involuntarily looked up as if he was jolting.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t mind at all.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, but ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” I would be happy to cook for you because this is the least I can do to repay you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa smiled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">You can tell from her expression that she is not angry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I appreciate you saying that. I also apologize for the light-hearted way I blew the whistle on your cooking.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">In general, mothers are annoyed when their sons tell them that their wives are better cooks than they are.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was an act that added fuel to the fire of the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law problem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even if it was the mother who asked the son, he should not have answered so rashly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition to that, Yuzuru and Arisa have no intention of getting married, so there will be no mother-in-law problem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, Yuzuru believed that Sayuri was a person who would not be offended by such things.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That was the background of the story. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But even without that, it would have been better not to say anything unnecessary.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right ……. When I found out that Yuzuru-san had been talking about my cooking, I felt a little embarrassed.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s skin flushed slightly and she scratched her cheek as she said it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she looked up at Yuzuru and started to squirm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But I was happy. I realized that you really …… felt that way about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think I’ve been telling you for a long time that your food is delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Not many people would tell you that something you made for them tastes bad, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">&ndash;In general, it is bad manners to complain about the food that someone has prepared for you.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, there’s nothing wrong with critiquing the food you eat at a restaurant afterward…….</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa has been cooking for Yuzuru for free.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Common sense would dictate that the answer would be “delicious”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Of course, I knew that Yuzuru-san wasn’t saying this out of flattery. You were eating a lot of second helpings. So, …… it means that you considered my cooking to be so delicious that you wanted to brag about it to your family. Yes, I was happy to know that again.”</p>
	<p>Then Arisa let out a small sigh.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Can I complain a little?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Let it out as you feel like it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru nodded his head in agreement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa thanked him in a fading voice and then let out her thoughts.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t know if my family can be called a …… family, but those people have never said a word about how delicious the food is.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her eyes clouded over.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She turned her face down and confessed in a pained voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t really ……. I don’t really like to cook. I was forced to do it. No, It’s not fair to say that. I’ve never been told to cook directly. But it’s natural for me to cook at home. That’s why I can’t say no.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She then smiled self-mockingly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was very painful to watch her smile as she trembled her shoulders slightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I didn’t want anyone to get mad at me. That’s why I became good at cooking. It’s all about that. I didn’t want to do it voluntarily or anything like that. …… I was just scared. It’s not something I’m proud of.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa took a deep breath.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she looked at Yuzuru with moist eyes and smiled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her smile was slightly strained as if she was trying to force herself to be cheerful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, I was very happy when Yuzuru-san praised me. Even if it was just flattery. Afterward, when I found out that Yuzuru-san really thought it was delicious, I was so happy that I actually wanted to jump up and down. It was my first time …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A drop of tears flowed down from the corner of Arisa’s eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said, still smiling.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I wanted to cook for you, that’s how I felt. I came every week because I wanted you to eat my food. For the first time, I was happy to be a good cook. That’s why…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru called out her name in a small voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he hugged her, who looked a little surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He pressed her face against his chest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa left him to do as he pleased.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He gently stroked her hair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You worked hard.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a while, Arisa moistened Yuzuru’s chest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The sobs were heard for a few minutes at a time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soon she looked up and wiped the drops from the corners of her eyes with her fingers.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s no good. …… When I’m with Yuzuru-san, I start to cry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Does that mean it’s my fault?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked jokingly, and Arisa chuckled before answering.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, you’re right. Yuzuru-san is a bad person. …… I feel like being spoiled.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe it was because she let out her depression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s expression was more radiant than before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Totally, it’s Yuzuru-san’s fault that the conversation got lost in the shuffle.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oops, sorry. …… So, what was that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru asked that, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa started clamoring.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …..Therefore, cooking for Yuzuru-san is, well, fun. As long as I can get you to say it’s delicious, I’ll make as many …… dishes as you want.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After she said that, Arisa’s face turned red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She realized that she had made a somewhat risky statement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She waved her hand in panic and denied it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Ah, you see, that was! It’s not like I’m going to be cooking miso soup for you every day from now on!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, ……, you don’t have to tell me that, I know.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">(<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Making miso soup every day for someone is basically a marriage proposal for Japanese</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt his own face getting hotter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He didn’t think that Arisa had proposed to him, but when she was so blatantly embarrassed, he became embarrassed too.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If I had to use an analogy, I would say that it’s like feeding a cat. A cat that eats well is cute, you know what I mean?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s a terrible thing to say.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">I’m a stray cat?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru shouted in protest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, looking at it objectively, it may look like a cat that was being fed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or rather, it’s exactly like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Surprisingly, the analogy was spot on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru thought to himself and felt a little miserable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“And anyway, I don’t mind cooking for Yuzuru-san. And I’m not reluctant to cook for your family. Do you understand me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Nya!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Please stop messing around.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was scolded by Arisa and cowered his shoulders.</p>
