<h3>Chapter 32 &#8211; “Engagement” and “Business”</h3>

	<p class="block_6">“Or do you want to marry her? If you’re right, and Arisa-san is really just being threatened, then what are your chances?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Yuzuru approached the scene with a short run, he heard Ayumi’s voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With that comment, Yuzuru somehow grasped the current situation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The boy, Kobayashi, seemed to have some misconceptions about the relationship between Yuzuru and Arisa that were not too far off the mark.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He probably thinks that Yuzuru is using his money and power to force Arisa to have a relationship with him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So, while Yuzuru was away, he approached Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the process, he said something that angered Ayumi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi was hostile to Kobayashi and argued against him…</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the middle of the conversation, she realized that Kobayashi liked Arisa, and said nastily, “Would you rather marry her? “</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both Yuzuru and Ayumi have received training in oratory from their parents, so they can win against people who have never received such training if they only talk.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Be aggressive in asserting your opinions.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Never be the first to admit you are wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what their parents taught them…</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayumi. What’s all this fuss about?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru called out to Ayumi as if to condemn her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi seemed to have noticed that Yuzuru was a little angry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She pointed at Kobayashi with a disgruntled expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This man insulted Niisan and Arisa-san. So I countered. Am I in the wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think you should consider your location a bit.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru calmly replied.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi then looked around in a bit of a panic.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, if you make that much noise, the people around you will look at you.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The lesson their parents taught them was, in essence, “show people that you’re right,” but to do so in a shopping mall was a bit much.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After admonishing Ayumi, Yuzuru turned to Kobayashi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been a while, Kobayashi-kun.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? Ah, yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru greeted him politely, he nodded with a dumbstruck expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response to him, Yuzuru took out his cell phone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Would you like to exchange contact information?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? No, what are you ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was wondering if you had something you wanted to ask me. “</p>
	<p class="block_7">As for Yuzuru, this incident has given him a reason to discuss with him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be troublesome if they had a strange misunderstanding with each other, so it was necessary to talk about it once and for all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You have your own business to attend to, don’t you? We’ll talk about it later. What do you say?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Bu, But ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think you need some time to collect your thoughts.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He nodded reluctantly when Yuzuru pressed him with an uncompromising attitude.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He seemed to be a weak-minded and easily influenced person.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They exchanged contact information and parted ways on the spot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He left as if he was running away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After seeing him off, Yuzuru turned to Arisa and Ayumi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you two okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, yeah. We’re fine.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah. Uh, Niisan. Are you perhaps……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I need to have a word with you later.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“O~Okay.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Fortunately, the rest of the date went off without a hitch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now, Yuzuru heard the story from Ayumi along with the sermon later and confirmed the situation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Basically, it was as Yuzuru had predicted.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After making sure to keep Ayumi quiet about Arisa being abused, Yuzuru got in touch with Kobayashi.<br class="calibre7" /></p>
	<p class="block_7">Fortunately, he was able to make it the next day, Sunday.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru met him at a coffee shop in the nearest station to his house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They took a table in silence and ordered coffee.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When the coffee arrived…,</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru cut to the chase.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayumi told me about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, um, ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Apparently, in your mind, I threatened Arisa and forced her into a relationship with me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“… I’m sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kobayashi seems to be aware that he had said something rather rude.</p>
	<p class="block_7">… However, Arisa was indeed forced to get engaged, and there is no doubt about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll accept your apology. And …… Ayumi was a bit out of line. I apologize on behalf of my sister for that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kobayashi was the first to admit fault, so Yuzuru apologized as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi’s last words were clearly superfluous.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now, there is something that needs to be clarified first.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Where did the information about the engagement leak from?</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not that the engagement story is top secret, it’s just that it’s best to keep it to oneself. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it is important to clarify why he, a mere civilian and a stranger, has the information about the engagement, and in a very distorted way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I heard about it…… from Haruto-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru remembered Arisa’s attitude towards Haruto.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa did not trust Haruto, and…… it seems that her decision was not a mistake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The intentions when this information was leaked to Kobayashi was not clear, but it was an unnecessary thing to do.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though he is not a part of this, he should not pass on important information that will affect the lives of Yuzuru and Arisa to a complete stranger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This should be a matter of formal protest to the Amagi family through their father, Kazuya Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Most of all, Kobayashi, who was misinformed, is in a sense a victim.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This guy has a lot of sympathies, including a broken heart.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However… even if it so, Yuzuru was not going to forgive him for putting Arisa and Ayumi in danger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru decided to swallow his anger and displeasure because there was nothing Kobayashi could afford to pay him even if he said he would not forgive him, and it would be even more troublesome if Kobayashi were to get upset.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kobayashi may not have much to lose, but they do.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru then began to speak in a clear tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“First of all, let me make it clear that I did not threaten Arisa to force her into a relationship. I wasn’t even that keen on this engagement in the first place.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that true?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do I look like such an imbecile to you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If that’s the case, it would be a shame.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was not going to pretend to be a nice young man, but Yuzuru thinks that he doesn’t look like a bad person.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, but isn’t …… Yukishiro-san a beautiful girl?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Even if you say she is beautiful. I’m a high school student. It is too early to decide my future. It’s just common sense.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">My own values are the same as yours.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru reminded him of that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seemed to have an effect, and he felt Kobayashi’s attitude softening little by little.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I, I see…… That’s right. isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. Both Arisa and I are engaged to be married for family reasons, and we’re getting along just fine. And our engagement is not official either. So …… if the relationship doesn’t progress, it will disappear naturally.” </p>
	<p class="block_7">As for the fake engagement, he can’t talk about it since he doesn’t trust Kobayashi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There’s not much point in talking about it, though. </p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… But, um, the money was paid in return for the engagement, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Technically, it was a loan. And it’s a huge amount.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After saying that, Yuzuru told Kobayashi the amount.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, the amount was far more than he had expected.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It was my father who loaned this out. …Do you think any parent would spend this much money on their son’s love affairs?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Unless, of course, Yuzuru is incredibly unpleasant to look at, is of a late age, and cannot find a marriage partner without a large sum of money. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru is still young, so there is no need to rush.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not worth it to Yuzuru’s parents to spend that much money on Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you understand me now? My father gave them the loan as a matter of business. So the loan had nothing to do with the engagement. …There is no such fact that Takasegawa paid Amagi money as the price for the engagement, or for Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said this, Kobayashi fell silent.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">Is there something that he still doesn’t understand?</i> Yuzuru tilted his head inwardly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As he pondered how to explain again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ………….rry”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Kobayashi said and bowed deeply.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was a little surprised by this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I got jealous in an ugly way, made a hasty decision on my own, and went out of control, ……hurting Yukishiro-san and your sister…I’m sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, no, …… Raise your head. It was all due to an unfortunate misunderstanding.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Yuzuru was inwardly relieved.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi’s fault was that she had crushed Kobayashi too thoroughly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It wouldn’t be surprising if he resented her for that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If Kobayashi becomes a stalker and starts to harm Arisa or Ayumi, it will be a big problem.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Especially since Arisa and Kobayashi seem to be living in the same neighborhood, the danger is high.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That was what Yuzuru was worried about.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Kobayashi was more straightforward than he had expected.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was a blessing in disguise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Well, maybe that’s why he was deceived.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll also inform Haruto-san that he’s mistaken. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah,…. that would be great.”</p>
	<p class="block_11">That guy probably wouldn’t believe him even if he tells that to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru thought but did not say it out loud.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, Takasegawa-san. Can I ask you one last question?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… What is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you like Yukishiro-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… That’s a tough question.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s feelings for Arisa were much the same as when he told Soichiro and Sei before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, he likes her, but he’s not in love with her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Something like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that so?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s answer was vague, but Kobayashi seemed to be satisfied with it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think Takasegawa-san is the right man for Yukishiro-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You are …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m fine. I’m not a …… man worthy of Yukishiro-san. Either way.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Whether Yuzuru and Arisa fall in love with each other or not.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His first love will never be fulfilled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what Kobayashi stated.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“Yukishiro-san… looks happiest when she is next to Takasegawa-san… And thanks to Takasegawa-san, I was able to make a resolve. Thank you very much.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">After saying that, he put the coffee money on the table and left.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was left alone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“She looks happiest huh …”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru muttered, looking up at the ceiling.</p>
	
	<p class="block_11">Yuzuru’s seriousness: 50% -&gt; 80%.</p>
