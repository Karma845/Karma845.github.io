<h3>Chapter 28 &#8211; Fiancée is a Cat</h3>
	
	<p class="block_6">Since Arisa had made it for him, Yuzuru decided to try the pumpkin pudding right away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He placed the spoon into the cup.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seemed to be the hard type.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he put it in his mouth, the rich egg taste and the pumpkin flavor and sweetness spread to his mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It also has a nice texture.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When served with the caramel sauce at the bottom, the bitterness and sweetness become quite different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, it’s good. Like the previous cake, you’re also good at making sweets, aren’t you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru praised her, Arisa shook her head in embarrassment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Not at all. I certainly make it sometimes with leftover flour, eggs, and milk, so I might be able to do it better than others…….If<span class="calibre5"> you follow the recipe, I think anyone can make it easily.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think that’s because your cooking skills are so good. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">One question emerged here for Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_11">Can Arisa make any kind of food?　Is there anything she is not good at?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are there any dishes you’re not good at?　I mean, cooking, of course.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, there are……. I’m not good at making Chinese food. I find it difficult.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Come to think of it, I don’t remember eating much of your Chinese food.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, who is a good cook, says she’s not good at it. But it seemed to him that she’s generally good at it, though maybe not to the expert level.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it seems that she is not very confident, and basically Arisa cooks mostly Japanese food or western food such as croquettes, fried shrimp, and omelets.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe she has never cooked Chinese food before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Unlike katsuo dashi and kombu dashi, the Chinese taste must rely on flavor enhancers.” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Katuo and Kombu are dashi types used for flavoring</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Does Arisa have a negative stance on such things?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Incidentally, Yuzuru has grown up with his mother’s ” Ajinomoto”, so he doesn’t have any qualms about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he prefers Arisa’s seasoning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No way. I also use it in some cases. It’s just that …… I feel defeated if anything. It’s humiliating.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He couldn’t understand it at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What is it that makes her feel defeated in the first place?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Is it the culture of Chinese food?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or is it the taste?</p>
	<p class="block_7">What would Arisa gain by winning?</p>
	<p class="block_7">He wondered but didn’t say it out loud.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Also, I don’t think I have sufficient heating power. I’ve never been able to make fried rice with a satisfactory flavor.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Fried rice. …… Well, that’s a profound one.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If it is fried rice, Yuzuru has made it a few times.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Peperoncino and fried rice are simple but profound dishes,……, and there is an image of many people who are strangely obsessed with them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Speaking of Chinese food, Ayaka’s good at it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Is that so?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah. I’ve been treated to Chinese food a few times and it was delicious. Apparently, she learned it from a Chinese chef she knew.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka, despite her appearance, is an excellent cook.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She is particularly good at Chinese food and is so obsessed with it that she has bought an iron pot.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If I ask her……, will she teach me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sure she’d be happy to teach you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Surely she will teach her with a smug look on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll ask her then. …… I’ll do my best to treat you to some delicious Chinese food.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m looking forward to it. Because your cooking is a weekend pleasure for me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That much, huh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, I could eat it every day.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he could eat Arisa’s cooking every day, he would be very happy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The people of the Amagi family should be aware that they are the lucky ones.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… every day, huh? Then, Should I do it for you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s eyes widened at Arisa’s suggestion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It sounded like something he could wish for, and if she could make it every day, so much the better. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You mean you’ll come here every day?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“As expected, that might be tough….. so I’m going to make you a bento” (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Bento &ndash; Lunch box</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Bento!?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every day, a cute girl would make his lunch for him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As a man, this was a very welcome development.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… But isn’t that a lot of work?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I make my own lunch every morning. The effort is the same. But please pay for the ingredients.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you sure you want me to just pay for the ingredients?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though the effort is the same, there is more work involved.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt bad about not paying for Arisa’s “labor costs”, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t worry. Yuzuru-san has taken care of me in many ways, such as paying for my coat. Besides……., I want to make it for you, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a slight blush on her cheeks, Arisa said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since she said she wanted to make it, he felt that it would be rude to try to force her to accept the “labor cost”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll take your word for it, then. …… I’ll be sure to thank you at some point in the future.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“There’s no need to thank me or anything ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I want to thank you. If I say so, will you let me?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru stated that, Arisa chuckled.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she gave a small nod.</p>
	<p class="block_7">While they were talking, Yuzuru finished eating the pudding.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He took out the box that he had put in the refrigerator and put it on a plate.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Here’s something in return for the pudding.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thank you very much.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa stared at the cake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she looked up at Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, come to think of it,…<span class="calibre5">… I didn’t say Halloween’s traditional phrase.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Traditional phrase.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, “Give me candy or I’ll play tricks on you”.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“Speaking of tradition, you’re not even wearing a costume……. So I don’t see the point in doing that.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said this with a wry smile on his face…..</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa took out something from a paper bag.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was two different types of headbands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One had cat ears, and the other had dog ears.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Looks like you were prepared already”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayaka-san gave it to me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That makes sense.”</p>
	<p class="block_11">Have a Halloween party with Yuzurun tomorrow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The image of Ayaka forcing cosplay goods on Arisa came to his mind.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re a dog person, aren’t you, Yuzuru-san? I’ll give you dog ears.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……Thank you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">For the time being, Yuzuru put on his dog ears and showed them to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he asked Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How do you like it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… fu fu, you look good.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Did you just laugh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I didn’t.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, fine. I put them on, so you should too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru urged Arisa to put on the cat ears, as she was reluctant to do so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After a moment of hesitation, Arisa put the headband on her head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She then asked Yuzuru with her eyes downcast in embarrassment and a slight blush on her cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“….How is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s cute…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Unlike Yuzuru, Arisa looked great with her cat ears.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Considering Arisa’s personality, dog ears would have been more appropriate than cat ears. But even without that, she was adorable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I, I see. …… Well, Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa turned to Yuzuru .</p>
	<p class="block_7">She then coughed lightly and bent her wrist as if imitating a cat, while her face turned red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If you don’t give me candy ……, I’ll play tricks on you, nyaa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, um!　Yuzuru-san!　Silence is the most troubling response!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa grabbed Yuzuru’s shoulders and shook him violently while her face looked like a boiled octopus.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Meanwhile, agonized from the cuteness of Arisa, Yuzuru covered his face with one hand as it began to heat up with excitement, embarrassment, and a feeling of sympathetic shame.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……I’ll give back the pudding, can’t I play a prank on you?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Obviously not!　I mean, how are you going to return it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a whack, Arisa continued to pound Yuzuru’s body with her fists.</p>
	<p class="block_7">True Dere Degree: ５５％→６０％</p>
