<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Fiancée and Physiological Phenomena</h3>
	
	<p class="block_7">The summer vacation has ended and school has started.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Yuzuru, it was the beginning of the days when he could eat Arisa’s cooking every week, but at the same time, it was the beginning of the depressing days when he had to spend long hours at school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Saturday, the first weekend after vacation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For the first time in about a month, Arisa came to Yuzuru’s apartment to play a game.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Today, she chose a very famous racing game series where a certain plumber and his merry band of friends race each other. (<span class="text_1">TN:</span><i class="calibre6">Mario Kart</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them lined up in front of the TV and used the remote control to control the characters.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was a bit good at this kind of game, as he had played it many times with Soichiro and his friends.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was confident that he could beat Arisa, who had a strange talent for games. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Nnngh………..”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s hard to concentrate when you’re sitting next to someone like Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every time she turned a curve, Arisa would bend her body in that direction while letting out a cry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When she bends in the opposite direction of where Yuzuru is sitting, it’s not a problem. But when she leans towards him, it becomes one.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps because they were originally sitting next to each other, her slender shoulders would almost touch Yuzuru whenever Arisa leaned her body.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her beautiful flaxen hair moved smoothly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The best part was her cute voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps she was trying to be enthusiastic, but the strangeness of her voice made him conscious of her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ve won again, haven’t I, Yuzuru-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, ……, I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s the matter?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, my eyes are just a little tired.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said and put down the controller.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He stretched out and lay down on the floor.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he checked the hands on his watch.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He had been playing the game for a long time now, so it was true that he was tired.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Though it was more from being overly conscious of Arisa than from eye fatigue.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you okay, Yuzuru-san.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Arisa does not seem to be aware of this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked into Yuzuru’s face with a worried expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s heart leaped as her beautiful eyes and full, seductive lips appeared in front of him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Don’t worry ……, I’ll recover after a little rest.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said and covered his eyes with his hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a gesture to protect his tired eyes, but his true intention was to block Arisa’s face from his view.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a little too stimulating to look at this beautiful face up close.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Arisa, seemingly completely unaware of this, started running her fingers through Yuzuru’s hair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The soft-touch of her fingers could be felt through the hair and scalp of his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It made him even more nervous, but he couldn’t disturb Arisa, who seemed to be enjoying herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After being left undisturbed for a while, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">This time, Arisa’s hands reached out to his cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Two warm hands wrapped around his cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But as expected, Yuzuru couldn’t seem to endure this in many ways, so he tried to stop the skinship any further.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa, can I get up?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh ……, sorry. I got carried away.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru got up, slowly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he looked at Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked away from Yuzuru awkwardly, her skin stained with vermilion as if she had realized after all this time that she had done something daring.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she glanced at Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(…… Cute)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru involuntarily gulped down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He had such an aggressive urge to …… push her <span class="calibre5">down, and</span> violate her to his desire.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Fu~. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru sighed heavily and expelled his desire.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he turned his back on Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he thought of the four dogs he had at home and calmed himself down.</p>
	<p class="block_7">………………</p>
	<p class="block_7">…………</p>
	<p class="block_7">……</p>
	<p class="block_7">(Good)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he turned to face Arisa again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But, with a frightened look on her face, Arisa asked Yuzuru in a worried, anxious voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, that…was it may be unpleasant?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked up at Yuzuru to see if his mood was good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Once again, Yuzuru imagined the four dogs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Bow-Bow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it’s not like that. Rather, it’s the opposite: …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… opposite, you say?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a puzzled expression, Arisa tilted her head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she moved her gaze to Yuzuru’s lower abdomen ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">And her face turned as red as a tomato.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She turned her back and shouted in panic.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What are you thinking ?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, it was you who made me think…… what to say …… it’s a physiological phenomenon…… no, of course, I feel bad, but…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The instincts react regardless of Yuzuru’s reasoning, so it can’t be helped.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And by the way, it had subsided a lot now.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But let me make this clear, I have no intention of hurting you. …… But, well, impulses are a thing, and I’m a human being, a man. So I’d like you to be considerate of that, and stop being so defenseless. Of course, I’m the one who should be most careful, so it may be unreasonable to ask you to do something like that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Yuzuru said this, Arisa slowly turned her body towards him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The pearly skin is still slightly blushed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… How far would you like me to go?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I suppose you could stroke my hair, ……, but I have to be prepared. Perhaps you could give a word prior to it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’ll be careful.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a mysterious expression, Arisa nodded.</p>
	
	
	<p class="block_7">Unlike earlier, she put a considerable distance between her and Yuzuru.</p>
	
	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JFNQSLH/194750.jpg"></img>
	
	
	<p class="block_7">But if she suddenly distances herself, it will hurt as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, Arisa is also just surprised, and she does not dislike him… is what he wanted to believe.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa seemed to have noticed that Yuzuru was feeling a little depressed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She abruptly changed the subject.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“About next week…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“May I invite you out …… this time?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">An invitation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, an invitation to go on a date.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally, Yuzuru was the one who always proposed the entertainment facilities, swimming pools, and summer festivals, so it made sense for Arisa to invite him to do something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, sure. …… Do you have any plans about where we’re going?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru asked her, and Arisa nodded.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I want to go to the cinema. …… I’ve never been to one before.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Thus, the movie theater date was decided.</p>
