<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Fiancée and Sports Festival</h3>

	<p class="block_6">Early October.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was the day of the sports festival.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At Yuzuru’s high school, the sports festival is held not at the school, but at a rented athletic field.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are spectator seats, so it’s easy to watch the games.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But ……, our high school’s sports festival is so boring.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I agree.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, …… it’s not interesting.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Yuzuru agreed with Hijiri’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">What goes on at a typical high school sports festival?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Team gymnastics?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Cavalry battle?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ball games?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Well, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even if you don’t like physical activities, you can still enjoy them to a certain extent.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Such competitions are the main thing, aren’t they?</p>
	<p class="block_7">At least in Yuzuru’s junior high school and elementary school days, such competitions were held at the sports festival.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But this high school was different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The individual events are just running and jumping, such as the 100-meter run, 200-meter run, and high jump.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The group events are …… relays at best.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Team gymnastics?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Cavalry battle?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ball games?</p>
	<p class="block_7">There are no such interesting events.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is not a sports festival, it’s a track meet.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri spat out his words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru agreed with him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru is not averse to exercise, and he is a member of the basketball club (although he only goes once a week to enjoy it), but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">This sports festival is not very interesting.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Then why don’t we just watch the girls and have some fun?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro said with a serious face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This guy looks serious at first glance, but on the inside, he’s more of a jerk, and by the way, he’s a bit of a pervert.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… That’s the only way to have fun.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Incidentally, Yuzuru was no different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Because he’s a boy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This is why Yuzuru and his friends decided to support the activities of the girls.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Gym uniforms are …… a bit erotic, aren’t they?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I can understand.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Indeed.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Yuzuru agreed with Hijiri’s casual words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Gym clothes are short-sleeved and short-panted because of their function.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Therefore, you can see more skin than you might think.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, the fabric is so thin that the unevenness of the body is clearly visible …… and sometimes its interior can be seen highlighted.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, normally girls wear camisoles so that they don’t have a problem with transparency, so it’s almost impossible to see their bras. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it’s still erotic enough.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s not for erotic purposes. …… On the contrary, it’s for extremely healthy and wholesome purposes, but the fact that it’s somehow erotic is probably a good thing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro said such truth with a very serious face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Hijiri nodded their heads repeatedly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Also, isn’t it important that it’s a part of high school life, or …… a part of our youth?　It’s more like nostalgia. …… Well, we’re not that old.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sweat and workout clothes are important too, right?….. I wouldn’t get excited about something that looks unhealthy after all. It may be an instinct.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru and Hijiri also developed their own theory.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, you have to keep your voice low so that the people around you can’t hear you,…….</p>
	<p class="block_7">If the girls in my class heard such obscene talk, there would be no place for them tomorrow.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, by the way, …… they used to have bloomers in the past, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru recalled the information he had gotten from the internet and his parents.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, now you won’t be able to see them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Old men seem to like that kind of thing. But frankly, it doesn’t seem that way for us, does it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No. …… Well, erotic things are erotic, aren’t they?　I can see why it would make you uncomfortable.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I know what you mean. To be honest, it’s too much like cosplay. For us.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Hijri agreed with Yuzuru’s opinion.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For the three of them, bloomers are a relic of the past, a classic ……, just a cosplay.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Not that there’s anything wrong with it, but something is different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Speaking of which, when it comes to bloomers…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro’s eyes were on his two childhood friends.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka and Chiharu were there.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both of them have great <span class="calibre5">proportions…</span>…so when they wear gym clothes, the unevenness of their bodies stands out clearly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They may have noticed Soichiro’s gaze, and the two jumped up and down and waved their hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro waved his hand lightly and continued.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The girls’ pants at our school are a little short.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Now that you mention it…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s true. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The boys’ pants are normal, but the girls’ pants seem to be a bit shorter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The length was about ten centimeters above the knees.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s about as short as a table tennis uniform.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, it looks cool, I guess.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s cool. Yeah.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Yuzuru nodded excessively at Hijiri’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… The truth of the matter is that it is rather unimportant whether it is cool or not.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The important thing is how much of the leg you can see.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, Hijiri.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s up, Yuzuru?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Isn’t that Nagiri-san running over there?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru pointed to a girl who seemed to be desperately running in the relay.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She is a slender girl with long black hair in a ponytail.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s hard to see from a distance, but …… it’s probably Tenka Nagiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, you’re right.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m surprised …… she’s not much of an athlete.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro said, somewhat surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If you were to tell, she is not very quick on her feet …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well,……she has skinny legs that don’t seem to have any muscles.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijri said with a snort.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka has long and very thin legs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But…… not so thin as to be unhealthy. She’s fine for her face and legs. Only for her face and legs “</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka’s legs are what you would classify as beautiful legs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Because they are slender, they look good when she wears her gym uniform.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However…..It seems that she is not very good at exercise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Strangely, she looks good in gym clothes even though she’s not very good at sports. …… But maybe that’s exactly why she looks so good.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s time for me to go.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After checking his watch, Yuzuru stood up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was almost time for the competition that Yuzuru had chosen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What was it, your event.?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a 200-meter x 6 relay. Cheer for me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If I feel like it”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, we’ll see in between watching the girls.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you guys still calling yourselves friends?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Making a light comment, Yuzuru left the scene.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru met up with his classmates who were running the relay with him, he used the time before it started to do some light preparatory exercises and practice passing the baton.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In reality, most of his classmates, including Yuzuru, were not interested in winning …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">But they didn’t want to be embarrassed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would be a little awkward if someone lost the baton and became a “war criminal,” so they took it very seriously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(I wonder if they’re watching…)</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was only a few minutes before the relay was to start.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru checked the spectator seats.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro and Hijiri……</p>
	<p class="block_7">They were watching the girls’ 100-meter run.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They were probably looking at their breasts or legs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Girl’s chest and legs and Yuzuru’s efforts.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The former seems to be more important to the two of them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You heartless people.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">But then again, Yuzuru does the same thing, so he can’t speak about others.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Next, Yuzuru looked for someone else.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The girl with the beautiful flaxen hair was staring at Yuzuru and the others.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru’s gaze met hers.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then …..</p>
	<p class="block_7">She waved her hand lightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His heart skipped a beat.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, didn’t …… Yukishiro-san just wave at us?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Really?…… I think I’ll try a little harder.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">His classmates started to make some noise.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And they started an ugly fight, saying …… ‘it was me’, ‘no me’, that she was cheering for.</p>
	<p class="block_7">(….. Shall I try a little harder.)</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a moment, Yuzuru felt a sense of superiority.</p>
