<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Fiancée and Morning</h3>

	
	<p class="block_7">“hm…I’m still a little sleepy.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru woke up in the morning, he felt a little lazy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">To begin with, he is not very keen on mornings. …… But yesterday, he walked around and talked late into the night, so he felt even more sleepy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I would have liked to take a second nap, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah. Arisa is here today, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">I can’t show her too much of a bad side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So Yuzuru decided to get up and go wash his face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As he walked down the hallway…</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Ah…… Yuzuru-san. Good morning.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Just then, he ran into Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that she also just woke up from sleep, and her eyes are dull.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, her long hair was shaggy from sleeping quirks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was refreshing to see the normally perfect Arisa looking so disheveled. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yuzuru-san? What’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru involuntarily looked away from Arisa, she tilted her head curiously.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru grabbed the chest of his Kimono and said to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…….You’d better fix that “</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked first at Yuzuru’s Kimono and then down at her own.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A blush crept into her cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This was because her Kimono had slightly slipped down, revealing her soft-looking mounds and deep cleavage, as well as her pure white underwear.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Not only that, but the obi seemed to have loosened considerably, exposing her pure white legs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If it had been a bit more undone, even her underpants would have been visible.</p>
	<p class="block_7">……It is not as if he was glancing at it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I..I., I’m sorry!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa hurriedly tried to fix her kimono.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, if you try to forcefully fix something that is on the verge of collapse, it is only logical that it will crumble even more.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru hurriedly turned away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">From behind him, he could hear Arisa’s distressed shriek.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru pointed to a nearby room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“There, there’s no one there now. You can calm down and fix it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Wah, yes! Ex, excuse me!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He heard the sliding door close behind him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Slowly, he turned around.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was no sign of Arisa there, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, man…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a piece of string that had fallen in the hallway.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s probably her kimono sash.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru picked it up and opened the sliding door slightly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He didn’t look inside, but just put his hand in holding the sash.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa, you forgot something.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry! I’m really sorry!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After handing over the sash, Yuzuru neatly closed the sliding door.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he muttered, suppressing his pounding heart.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Thanks to you, I’m awake now.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It had been an exciting morning, he thought to himself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You had to prepare breakfast for me as well…… I’m sorry.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At the breakfast table, Arisa bowed her head towards Sayori.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She planned to wake up early in the morning to help Sayori, but …… she overslept a bit, so that didn’t happen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s okay. Arisa-chan is a guest”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori smiled and said so.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she urged Arisa to eat without worrying about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As Arisa picked up her chopsticks, Yuzuru also started to eat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Today, since Arisa was there, there was one more side dish, but the taste was the same as always.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The fish is fluffy and delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, Arisa-chan. You have a good eye. I’ve recently upgraded my grill to the latest model.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori happily began to boast about the excellence of her cooking equipment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was honest enough to not mention the taste of the miso soup.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Takasegawa-san’s house is really big, isn’t it? Isn’t it really hard to clean it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">For Arisa, who usually does the housework at home, the first thing that comes to mind when she sees the big house is “It looks like a lot of cleaning work.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She asked Sayori that pure question.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Not really. The housekeepers do that kind of work.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah……you had one after all?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Of course. I’d die of exhaustion if I had to take care of four dogs and a house this big by myself. I can’t even do my work.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although Arisa was smiling fondly,……, only Yuzuru noticed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was a little taken aback by the statement, “I can’t even do my work”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… It seems that she thought that Sayori was a housewife.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Well, from the look and feel of it, Sayori was a laid-back person. At least she wouldn’t look like she was working as an office worker.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Where are the housekeepers then ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a weekend, so they’re off. We have two days off a week, eight hours a day, with pay.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">By the way, the housekeepers’ names are Suzuki, Sato, and Tanaka, respectively.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But for now, it’s unlikely that they’ll meet Arisa, who will be returning by the end of the day.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“By the way, what kind of work do you do ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What do you think it is?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a grin, Sayori laughed and asked Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa began to worry about whether she could imagine Sayori working at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori smirked and looked at her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since Arisa seemed to be in trouble, Yuzuru decided to answer for her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“She’s a university professor.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, Yuzuru. Why are you answering ?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Ayumi, who had been silent until a moment ago, intervened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s probably because his beloved bride was being bullied by her mother-in-law.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“How could the little sister-in-law say that?&ndash;“</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi and Sayori started a skirmish.</p>
	<p class="block_7">&ndash;On the other hand, Arisa, who was treated like a “beloved wife,” turned her face down in embarrassment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her ears were stained bright red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That kind of reaction makes it even more embarrassing for me&ndash; Yuzuru thought to himself as he chewed on the pickles.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hey, Arisa-chan. So……, what do you think I’m a scholar of? Can you guess?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……let’s see. Maybe American literature?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? How did you know?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori, who was easily caught by the guess, made a dissatisfied expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response, Arisa, who had regained her usual calm, cool and relaxed expression, replied matter-of-factly.</p>
	
	<p class="block_7">“I heard that Yuzuru-san’s great-grandmother was from the United States, which means that his father Kazuya-san is a quarter…right? So I wondered if there was some kind of connection.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” It’s frustrating but true. Right, Kazuya-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yeah, I guess so. It’s nostalgic.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Sayori asked Kazuya, he answered with a smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The air was slightly sweet, so Yuzuru put some miso soup in his mouth to cover it up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was sweet and sour.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps to blow away the strange atmosphere that Kazuya and Sayori had created, Ayumi suddenly changed the subject.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So, Arisa-san. What do you think? Our mother’s cooking, Is it good?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? Ah, yes. Of course…… it’s delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Didn’t she say it was delicious just now?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said to the little sister-in-law who seemed to be plotting something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Ayumi ignored him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I was just curious because Niisan once told us that Arisa-san’s cooking was better than my mother’s.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi’s words made Arisa’s expression tense.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was probably worried that Sayori would be offended by being compared to her cooking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, she stared at Yuzuru with fierce eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but look away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, now that you mention it, that’s what he said. Yuzuru’s stomach is being grabbed by Arisa. I’m so jealous.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Sayori said in a joking tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she winked at Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I don’t mind at all, so don’t be disheartened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That was the signal.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, you know, we all have our likes and dislikes when it comes to food or taste. I can feel the love in Sayori-san’s cooking. I think it is very delicious.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa said this and stood up for Sayori, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi, who is completely in the mood for a little sister-in-law, does not seem to be interested in such safe words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I want to try your cooking, Arisa-san. Can you make me lunch or dinner?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh~, no,…… that’s …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Kazuya, who had been silent until now, glared at Ayumi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayumi, Arisa-san is going to be troubled. Quit it …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Meanwhile, Yuzuru spoke to Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You can ignore Ayumi’s selfishness. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Sayori, like Ayumi, seemed to be unable to contain her interest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m still curious about it ……. My son raves about her cooking. If it’s really good, I want to learn from it. …… But I wouldn’t force you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, she looked at Arisa with expectant eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa was looked at with anticipation by both Ayumi and Sayori. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">She blushed and nodded with a shrug.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, if you are okay with my cooking, I can prepare something for you. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ” Operation, success!” “</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a clap, Sayori and Ayumi joined their hands together.</p>
