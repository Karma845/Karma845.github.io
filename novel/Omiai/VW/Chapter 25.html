<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; Fiancée’s Shortcomings</h3>
	
	<p class="block_6">“Well, we didn’t make much progress in our studies after all.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the way home.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru said to Arisa with a wry smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he knew from the start that if he studied with them, he probably wouldn’t make much progress in his studies.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“….Somehow, I’m sorry”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was fine that Yuzuru’s studies were not progressing, but he was sorry that he had ruined Arisa’s studies as well.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Somehow, Yuzuru felt as if he had dragged Arisa down the path of evil.</p>
	<p class="block_7">&ndash;In the meantime, Arisa gave a bitter smile.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Haha …… Well, my studies didn’t go as well as I had hoped, so I’ll have to study when I get home. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she squinted her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But it was fun.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa clasped her hands behind her back and walked with a somewhat bouncy gait.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been a long time since I’ve had fun with people like that. Or maybe it’s the first time”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You haven’t had the chance before?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru does not have such a wide range of friendships.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But he does have friends like Soichiro and Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">It seems that Arisa has only ever had acquaintances with whom she could “chat over lunch”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i class="calibre6">But hadn’t those people asked her to hang out with them?&nbsp;</i>Yuzuru tilted his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One or two opportunities are likely to arise if you live for sixteen years.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, I think there were opportunities …… now that I think about it. Some people asked me out. I guess it’s my fault.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Arisa sighed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though she had seemed to be in a good mood a while ago. She seemed to have gone into “I’m a bad girl” mode again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The past is the past. And …… it’s not unreasonable for you to do so. ……You didn’t like it, did you? You didn’t want your situation to be known.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When you get close to someone, there will be an opportunity for them to know about your family situation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They might keep their distance…</p>
	<p class="block_7">They might start strange rumors just for the fun of it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If that’s the case, it’s better not to socialize with people from the beginning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This must be the reason why Arisa was acting as if she was shunning people.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or so Yuzuru thought, but</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… it is a little different.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, the situation was slightly different.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What I didn’t want to do was…… well, I didn’t want them involved in my situation.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……You don’t want them to be dragged into it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s not that auspicious a reason.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa shook her head from side to side, helplessly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She then smiled slightly, as if mocking herself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I didn’t want to worsen my position because of something they did. That’s all.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Selfish, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s only natural if you’re trying to protect yourself.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If you call it selfishness, it may be selfishness.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But there is nothing wrong with trying to protect yourself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s not your fault.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru interrupted Arisa’s voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He repeated it to Arisa, who looked a little surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s not your fault. I think I’ve said it before, but I can guarantee you that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Isn’t that because you don’t know me, Yuzuru-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_11">Don’t say irresponsible things.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She stated as if blaming Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seemed to be a little aware that she was taking it out on Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though she said this with an angry expression, it quickly turned into a depressed expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But still, it seems that she can’t help it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m much uglier than you think, …… Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you think so? I’ve known you for six months. Even if I don’t know everything about you, and I think I have a pretty good grasp of your personality.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he knows the good parts.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And he knows the bad parts too.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s a lie.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I won’t know if it’s a lie until you prove it to me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru said that, Arisa was silent for a while.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she said a few words in a small voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m selfish.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s all?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru asked, Arisa shook her head from side to side.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m gloomy, insidious, negative…..”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I know.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arrogant, jealous, narcissistic, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I know that too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Please deny it a little!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Throw in the word ‘contrarian’ too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru chuckled, Arisa turned away her cheeks in a pouting manner. </p>
	<p class="block_7">She wants him to deny the bad things about her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it also pisses her off when people say irresponsible things about her without knowing anything about her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru guessed that this was how Arisa felt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She’s a little, no, quite a troublesome character.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“We all have a flaw or two. A flaw or two doesn’t count as a bad character.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not ‘but’…….&nbsp; If you’re a bad person just because you have flaws, then I’m a very bad person.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru cowered his shoulders in a goofy tone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Still, Arisa continued, “But, but”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” Yuzuru-san …… has a lot of good qualities, too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You have a lot, too.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……I don’t.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Serious, hardworking, good cook, good at studies, good at sports, kind, caring and attentive, cool, cute, beautiful, and also the figure is ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s sexual harassment!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa covered her ears as she said this.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her face was completely stained red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She glared at Yuzuru with her jade-green eyes, which were slightly teary, and scowled at him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m sorry, I got carried away. Please forgive me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I won’t forgive you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I will do anything.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Well, can I ask one?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa stopped in her tracks.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked up at Yuzuru with tears in her eyes and a fading voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Please lend me your chest.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Sure”</p>
