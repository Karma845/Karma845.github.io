<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; Fiancée” and The King’s Game</h3>

	<p class="block_6">” ” “Who’s the king!” ” “</p>
	<p class="block_7">They all drew lots.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The first king was …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, that’s me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The memorable first king was Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As it was the first time, Arisa started to worry about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, how about the person at ……4 show a one-shot trick or a special skill?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe because of her serious nature, but she gave a safe order.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And the person who got number four was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Number four is me!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Chiharu.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m not sure if it’s a one-shot trick or a special skill. …… oh, yeah. I’m good at wrestling. So, Soichiro-san. Please stand up.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ha~h? Why me ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Because I can’t do it by myself”</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">Don’t try to do a one-shot trick that you can’t do by yourself in the first place</i>, Soichiro complained, but lent a hand.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At that moment ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro’s body turned over.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Before he realized it, Soichiro was strapped around the neck with both of Chiharu’s legs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“’I’m done, I’m done ……, that’s enough!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He shouted painfully.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But to Yuzuru’s eyes, it looked like he was inwardly pleased.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It would have been more of a perk for Soichiro to get his face caught between Chiharu’s thighs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Well, that valuable time was over in about ten seconds.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘<i class="calibre6">Geez, why do I get into this kind of trouble ‘</i>……. Soichiro sits back on the sofa with this attitude.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“….. Now may be too late, but it may not be a good idea to give orders that involve other people without specifying a number.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa pointed out something that was really quite late.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka then nodded her head in agreement.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You’re right. I think we should make it mandatory to specify the number from now on since it would break the gameplay.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After confirming the rules again, they moved on……</p>
	<p class="block_7">The lottery was redrawn again.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This time, the king was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm, me. ……I would like to get back to Chiharu if possible.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You have to specify the number!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I know, I know.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro, who became the king, showed signs of thinking for a while and then ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Number 5, do ten squats. What do you think?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m number 5. But squatting. …… Should I fold my hands over my head?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I don’t care how you do it, as long as you do it right. But do it right and in-depth.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ye~s.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka replied cheerfully.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She raised her hands above her head and opened her legs about shoulder-width apart.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, slowly, she began to squat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“One, two, three. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At this time, Ayaka was wearing a long skirt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So there was no way to see inside the skirt, but ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, it was a bit strange to see a beautiful girl with good style, sweat on her forehead, doing squats while spreading her legs wide as the six of them watched.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The six of them, including Yuzuru, felt kind of weird.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s over. …… Surprisingly embarrassing, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka also seemed to have noticed the atmosphere around her midway through.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was unusual for her, who is always aloof, to have her face faintly tinged with red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now, it was time to get back on track and choose a new king.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The one who became the king was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“All right, that’s me. So, how about ……No. 3 go run around this mansion as fast as they can?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Hijiri proposed a punishment game that seems to be a real punishment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And the subject of the game was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hijiri-kun…..You better remember this.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Tenka who was not good at sports.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Tenka glanced at Hijiri with a sharp glare.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He said to her with a grin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Until forgotten. Just run as fast as you can, okay? I’ll check through the window, okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… I know. Well, okay. It’s no big deal to go around the house one lap.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">With that, Tenka walked out of the room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A few moments later, Tenka returned, sweaty, holding her sides and breathing hard.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Geez, …… hey, this house is too big, isn’t it ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, the Tachibana residence was much larger than Tenka had expected.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems to have become quite a workout.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I guess I’ll just have to settle this grudge. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, good luck with that.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">And so, a new king was chosen.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The person who drew the king’s lottery was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, it’s finally my turn.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was finally Yuzuru’s turn to play.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he had thought of his orders from the beginning.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I designate number one. If it’s a man, be a woman, if it’s a woman, be a man, until the game is over.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Okay, Yuzuru.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro answered in a falsetto voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was dismayed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… It is disgusting.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s horrible. …… You were the one who forced me to do this♥.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Soichiro was surprisingly enthusiastic.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This man was surprisingly flippant.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… It seems to have become more of an “oneesan” character than a normal girl, but that’s to be expected. (<b class="calibre1">TN:</b><i class="calibre6">Oneesan character means guys who behave like girls. I’m not sure about the official term</i>)</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now, the next person who became the king was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes! Hijiri, prepare yourself!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The queen, Tenka, was born.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She seems to be planning to take revenge on Hijiri.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“One in six chances? You can’t win.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Number two must end sentences in ‘Saurus or ‘don’ until the game is over.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No way! Oi!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that today, Hijiri had to use “Saurus” and “Don” at the end of his speech until the game was over.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a grin, Tenka laughed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">” ‘No way, Don!’ right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Understood……saurus.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">At that moment, someone spewed out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">All eyes were drawn to that person.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was …… Arisa, who laughed at him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yukishiro-san, did you just laugh at me saurus?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Kku ……S, Sorry …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that she has been caught in a loop.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the ear of Arisa, who was holding her stomach, …… Yuzuru whispered.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s so funny saurus?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“hi~u…kku……, no, please stop…… Yuzuru-san ……, d, don’t…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The king’s game was temporarily suspended for a while until Arisa’s laughter subsided.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Now, after a brief interruption, the next person to become king is ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s me, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Chiharu.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chiharu thought about it for a moment and then …… smirked.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, let’s do this. Tell me your preference for the opposite sex you like. Of course, you can tell me the name of the person you like, okay? The number is ……6!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">And the one who had the lottery number 6 was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Yuzuru.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru scratched his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Preference for the opposite sex?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes. Of course. There are some, aren’t there?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Smirking, Chiharu questioned Yuzuru with a laugh.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru couldn’t help but look at Arisa for a moment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And Arisa was looking at Yuzuru exactly the same way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Their gazes intersected.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru felt his own face heating up.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Without thinking, he averted his gaze.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Come on, hurry up, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……, yeah, let’s see.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru thought for a moment and then answered.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Someone who accepts me for who I am, but scolds me for the bad parts?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, ……, by the way, could that be ……?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s enough! Next round, next round !”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru interrupted Chiharu’s words with a loud voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He then proceeded to forcefully play the king’s game.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then the next king was ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s finally my turn to play, isn’t it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Ayaka.</p>
	
	<img src="https://i.ibb.co/z5GL7PF/194754.jpg"></img>
	
	<p class="block_7">The queen, Ayaka, crossed her arms and began to ponder.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I was actually going to order you to tell me who you like or something like that, but …… Chiharu beat me to it.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, the order that she was planning was given out by Chiharu first.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayaka pondered for a while and then …… popped her hand in the air.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, let’s do it this way. Say what you want the person you like to say to you, or what situation you want to be confessed to! Let’s see. …… Then, number three!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……That’s me.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The familiar, pretty voice made Yuzuru’s heart flutter involuntarily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru was aware that he himself was very nervous.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“A confession’s ……situation ……right?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, yeah, a proposal is also fine though”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Chira… Arisa glanced over at Yuzuru. </p>
	<p class="block_7">Her face was as bright red as a …… tomato.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If you ask me to be more specific, I can’t answer because I don’t feel it is time yet, but……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa squirmed, looking embarrassed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her gesture was very cute.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru listened to Arisa’s voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I like the romantic feeling. …… I prefer it on a special day, in a special place, with a special present. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After saying that, Arisa covered her face with her hands as if to say that she was too embarrassed to say anything anymore.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As expected, Ayaka couldn’t force Arisa to say anything else.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So she says, Yuzuru…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She suddenly changed her target.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The words were naturally heard by Yuzuru and also by Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Both of their faces turned red.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Stop making fun of us, Ayaka-chan.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, that’s right. …… We’re not like that. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">When Yuzuru and Arisa said this, Ayaka smirked ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Hmm? What are you talking about? I have no idea.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">She feigned ignorance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After digging their own grave, both Yuzuru and Arisa began to feel like running away in shame.</p>
