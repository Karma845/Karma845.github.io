<h3>Chapter 35 &#8211; Feelings for Fiancée</h3>


<p>&#8220;Ah, no&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa hurriedly let go of Yuzuru&#8217;s hand while her face turned bright red.</p>



<p>And then cleared her throat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, now that the meal is over,&#8230;. why don&#8217;t we exchange gifts?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru was beginning to feel a little embarrassed.</p>



<p>It was just the thing to change his mood.</p>



<p>First, from Arisa.</p>



<p>She took out a neatly wrapped package from her bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Yuzuru-san&#8230; This is a gift from me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, thank you. Can I open it&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru carefully opened the wrapping paper.</p>



<p>What emerged from inside was&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;A muffler?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a hand-knitted winter gear made of gray woolen yarn.</p>



<p>In gold embroidery, the word &#8220;YUZURU&#8221; is embroidered on it.</p>



<p>It looked very warm.</p>



<p>The colors were subdued and could be worn with any outfit.</p>



<p>Most importantly&#8230;, he could sense the feelings from Arisa in it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Arisa. Since it&#8217;s here, I think I&#8217;ll wear it on the return trip.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, it would be in the way now, so Yuzuru carefully folded it and placed it on the floor.</p>



<p>And Yuzuru also brought out the present for Arisa.</p>



<p>He handed a blue-green paper bag to Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;This, this is &#8230; can I open it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa opened the bag with a slightly nervous expression.</p>



<p>She opened the blue-green jewelry box that was inside.</p>



<p>&#8220;I picked it out, and I am not sure if you will like the design. How is it&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa&#8217;s white hands trembled as she picked up the necklace.</p>



<p>It was a pink gold necklace.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a very expensive item, but it&#8217;s a good one.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this okay? Compared to, you know, my present&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; I usually ask Arisa to make my bento and dinner for me right&#8230;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s something I can afford with my part-time job.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru replied, Arisa squeezed the necklace with both hands and pressed it against her chest.</p>



<p>She then looked at Yuzuru with slightly moistened eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take good care of it. &#8230;&#8230; and, may I put it on now?&#8221;</p>



<p>“Please show it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said this, Arisa gave a small nod and put the necklace around her beautiful, clean neck.</p>



<p>The necklace looked very good on her &#8230;. just as Yuzuru expected.</p>



<p>It looks much more gorgeous.</p>



<p>&#8220;How is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautiful&#8230; As I thought, It looks great on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Thank you very much&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa smiled happily.</p>



<p>When he saw how happy she looked, he knew from the bottom of his heart that he had chosen the right necklace.</p>



<p>Yuzuru decided to drop her off.</p>



<p>Holding hands, they walked together through the night streets.</p>



<p>The fun time flew by.</p>



<p>They came to a point where they were right next to Arisa&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>“Yuzuru-san, thank you for &#8230;&#8230; today. It was a memory that will last a lifetime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re exaggerating.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said that&#8230;</p>



<p>Arisa shook her head vigorously.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pQ02tXz/194756.jpg"></img>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an exaggeration. It&#8217;s been a long time since I had such a fun Christmas Eve. &#8230;&#8230; Thanks to Yuzuru-san, I think &#8230; I may have come to like winter&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I promised that I would try to make you like winter, didn&#8217;t I.?&#8221;</p>



<p>Even more &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Halfway through, Yuzuru felt like he was doing it more for fun.</p>



<p>He also realized that making Arisa happy and making her smile&#8230;.. had become his purpose in life.</p>



<p>“Winter is still ahead of us&#8230; Look forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. If it&#8217;s with Yuzuru-san, it will be fun whether it&#8217;s winter&#8230;., spring, summer, or autumn.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said something that made Yuzuru very happy.</p>



<p>A deep feeling of emotion welled up in his heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too&#8230;.. Arisa. Anything I do is fun as long as I&#8217;m with you&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru conveyed his honest feelings to Arisa.</p>



<p>If possible&#8230; He wanted to be with her forever.</p>



<p>He did not want to separate from her.</p>



<p>However&#8230; they had arrived at the front of her house.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san, then &#8230;I&#8217;ll be going.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah. Good night, Arisa.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>



<p>They exchanged parting words.</p>



<p>Arisa slowly turned her back on Yuzuru and was about to start walking&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before he noticed, Yuzuru had called out to Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa turned around &#8230;&#8230; and tilted her head curiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Even Yuzuru did not know why he had called out to her.</p>



<p>Just that&#8230; perhaps it was because he didn&#8217;t want to part from her.</p>



<p>He stopped her because he wanted to be with her.</p>



<p>But there was no way he could keep her there for a long time in the middle of winter.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;You see, Arisa&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have a favor to ask you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is it okay if I hug you?&#8221;</p>



<p>He wanted to feel more of her skin.</p>



<p>Before parting, he wanted to imprint the warmth and softness of her skin on his own body.</p>



<p>At Yuzuru&#8217;s request, Arisa&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise for a moment.</p>



<p>However, her jade-green eyes immediately squinted.</p>



<p>She smiled softly.</p>



<p>Her skin had turned rose-tinted.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa said and opened her arms.</p>



<p>Yuzuru approached her as if he were being sucked in &#8230;&#8230; and opened his arms wide and hugged her.</p>



<p>She was warm.</p>



<p>She was soft.</p>



<p>Her beautiful flaxen hair smelled so good.</p>



<p>The blood flowed wildly through his body.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine already, Arisa&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>Forcing down the feeling of regret, Yuzuru released Arisa.</p>



<p>Her face was &#8230;&#8230; bright red.</p>



<p>The same could be said for Yuzuru as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, once again. Till next time&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Till next time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru looked at Arisa as she walked into the house.</p>



<p>Then he turned on his heel and started walking down the street at night.</p>



<p>Looking up at the sky, he saw the stars shining brightly.</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t help but sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in trouble&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru then grabbed the scarf that Arisa had given him with both hands.</p>



<p>He could still feel Arisa&#8217;s warmth in his body.</p>



<p><em>I want &#8230;&#8230;Arisa.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to mess her up.</em></p>



<p><em>I want to monopolize her.</em></p>



<p><em>Her food, her scarf, her love, her smile, her angry face, her embarrassed face, her crying face, her beautiful eyes, her plump lips, her fine hair, her white porcelain skin, her soft limbs, and the secret parts under her clothes. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>



<p><em>I want everything to be mine.</em></p>



<p><em>I don&#8217;t want any other man to take any of it away from me.</em></p>



<p><em>That’s why&#8230;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Arisa&#8230; I&#8217;ve made up my mind. I&#8217;m going to get you, no matter what it takes.&#8220;</p>



<p>Yuzuru declared quietly.</p>



<p>Arisa’s true Dere degree: 100% → 120%</p>



<p>Yuzuru’s Seriousness: 90% → 120%</p>
