<h3>Interlude 4 &#8211; Net De Truth</h3>

	<p class="block_6">Late September.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… This week as well”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota Kobayashi muttered with a sigh as he peered through his binoculars at Arisa Yukishiro coming out of her house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota’s house was not far from Arisa’s, and he could see a little bit of what was going on by using binoculars from the balcony.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every Saturday, Arisa visits her boyfriend repeatedly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not hard to see why, because late at night, you can see a man walking her home.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man’s name was Yuzuru Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He is a boy of the same age as Shota.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Of course, he never declared himself to be Arisa’s boyfriend, but …… </p>
	<p class="block_7">It was clear from the way he walked past Shota’s house every night that the two were lovers.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ha~a …… I bet they’re happy.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every Saturday night.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he was at the front door and listened to the voices outside through the door, he could hear a little bit of Arisa and Yuzuru talking happily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa, who was always expressionless and unemotional.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She is making a joyful laughing sound.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s …… delightful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It should be a delightful thing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But he couldn’t rejoice …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">Something sludgy was swirling around in his chest.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He loved her first.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was supposed to make her happy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was jealous.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He envied him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was aware that it was ugly jealousy. </p>
	<p class="block_7">But still ……he couldn’t stop the feeling.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“If I were …… a little more ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">If only he were smarter.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he was good-looking.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he had been born rich.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Inevitably, he thinks that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He just couldn’t help but think that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Huh.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shota, where are you going?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“For a walk.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota replied bluntly to his mother and staggered out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He walked around aimlessly ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then he sat down on a bench in a nearby park.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As he gazed blankly at the sky, …… someone called out to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Shota-kun?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You are …… Haruto-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A young man with a carry-on bag approached Shota with a smiling face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Haruto Amagi.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa’s cousin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota was able to learn about Arisa’s complicated family situation because Haruto told him about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Also, …… Haruto knew that Shota liked Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It’s been a while. …… You’ve returned huh”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yeah, sorry for the late contact.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them talked to each other about the recent developments.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seemed that Haruto was planning to return to Kansai.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Are you okay with the train time?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“There’s still plenty of time.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">After checking his watch, Haruto said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Suddenly, Shota thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… Does he know that Arisa has a new lover?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh, come to think of it, …… Yukishiro-san seems to have found a boyfriend.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">As if he doesn’t care.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Casually.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As if to say, “It’s a beautiful day,” Shota said to Haruto.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Haruto’s…… expression clouded over.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That is …”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, no, I don’t mind it or anything… She was originally like an unreachable flower for me… I’m sure he’s a good person. …His name was Takasegawa-san, right? Since he is from the same school as Yukishiro-san, he must be smart, and his face is good-looking. …… And he seems handsome… He seems like a suitable person for Yukishiro-san… Someone like me cannot even reach his feet.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The more he tried to mend his words, the more miserable he felt.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the end, there was nothing left to say.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He scratched his head and sighed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In response to Shota, …… Haruto looked a little lost, but he seemed to have made up his mind about something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“About that, Shota. Actually, …… that’s not Arisa’s lover.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……Eh?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m going to tell you this because it’s you… My father has instructed me not to speak of this to others, so you should be careful too. He… Yuzuru Takasegawa is Arisa’s fiancée.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Fi, Fiancée?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota couldn’t help but shout out loud.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, in a panic, he covered his mouth with his hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“That’s right. …… It’s also a political marriage.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Political marriage ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He felt as if he was being told the setting of a science fiction or fantasy story.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was surprised that such a thing could exist in modern Japan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Arisa was forced to get engaged… The Takasegawa family is famous and respected in business and political circles. I think he liked her a lot. So, with the help of money and power, he got engaged to Arisa.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“S, such a thing…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was true that he looked rich.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s also true that he thought that guy was a jerk.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, at first glance, Arisa seemed happy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was the person that Arisa fell in love with.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He must be a good person, that’s what he thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And the reason he looked like a jerk was that his jealousy must have caused him to hallucinate that way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But Yukishiro-san seems to be having fun. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think my father is threatening her to get along with the Takasegawas. …… The Takasegawa family is one of the families in this country that you should never make enemies with.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Haruto then said to Shota as if to remind him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Do you understand? This is a secret… Let’s save Arisa together.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……ye, yes.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Confused, Shota could only nod.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he got home, he did some research on the Takasegawa family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he did, he found a lot of information.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Takasegawa family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The family that runs the companies called the Takasegawa Conglomerate or the Takasegawa Group.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is said that only the Tachibana family in Japan can compare to their financial strength.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, the real power of the Takasegawa family lies not only in their financial strength.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It seems that the family has been actively engaged in political alliances for a long time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">As a result, they are well known to politicians and bureaucrats. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">They also have a wide network of contacts in the EU and the US beyond Japan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In particular, they seem to have had a close relationship with the U.S. since before the war and were involved in the postwar effort to end the war.</p>
	<p class="block_7">While many conglomerates lost their power after the war, only the Takasegawa family (and the Tachibana family) did not lose their power, and on the contrary, they became even more powerful.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After the war, they provided enormous support and arms to outlaw groups and used them as pawns in various schemes to eliminate people who threatened the United States, the ruling party, and above all, their own vested interests.</p>
	<p class="block_7">This organization should have been subject to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act as a crime syndicate, but due to political pressure from the Takasegawa family, it was exempted from the law and is still active as a subcontractor of the Takasegawa family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, not a few politicians, bureaucrats, presidents of large corporations and mass media, and entertainers are customers of the illegal brothels operated by the organization and using the customer information, the Takasegawa family can move the prosecutor’s office at any time to socially eliminate influential people in Japan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Along with Tachibana, they are the emperors of the underworld who control Japan.</p>
	<p class="block_7">……………… </p>
	<p class="block_7">…………</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… </p>
	<p class="block_7">This was all information that was flooding the internet discussion sites, so it was doubtful whether it was true or not.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even Shota laughed at what he heard, especially about the emperor of the underworld.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Normally, he would not have believed it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However…, believing in the words of Haruto, he felt that it was not wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And if you think about it calmly, it’s just too strange to see Arisa, who has such a noble and solitary image, behaving like a puppy. </p>
	<p class="block_7">In other words, Arisa is being threatened.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But even if he knew that ……, what could he do?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota, who is just a commoner, can not win against such a terrible family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was nothing he could do, and the days went by.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was frustrated that he was helpless and could only watch as Arisa fell victim to that man’s poison.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then, one Saturday in November, …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was just a coincidence, really.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On his way back from a trip to the city center to relax, he went into a shopping mall to buy some clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s when he met her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was Arisa Yukishiro.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was with a junior high school-aged girl he had never seen before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That guy, Yuzuru Takasegawa, was not there …</p>
	<p class="block_7">He found himself calling out to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Oh…… Yukishiro-san, right? What a coincidence.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Kobayashi-san, huh? It’s really a coincidence.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Arisa looked a little surprised.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Feeling guilty for some reason, Shota said as if to excuse himself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I had to go to this neighborhood for a while. Then I thought I’d stop by and look at some clothes, so I went into a random store and saw you. Are you out shopping?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is obvious when you see it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota couldn’t help but gush to himself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But Arisa didn’t seem particularly bothered and replied nonchalantly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yes, that’s right”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had her usual calm, cool expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But …… strangely, he felt that she was prettier than before.</p>
	<p class="block_11">I want to get her.</p>
	<p class="block_11">I want her.</p>
	<p class="block_11">I don’t want to give her to that rich and handsome guy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He thought so strongly. </p>
	<p class="block_7">“You know, Yukishiro-san…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What is it?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I heard you got engaged. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then the atmosphere around Arisa’s body changed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">For a moment, it felt like … the temperature had dropped to below freezing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her eyes lifted slightly and her pupils became as cold as the surface of a lake.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Who told you that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Eh? … From Haruto-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……Tch.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a tongue click.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That Arisa clicked her tongue so unhappily that he could clearly see it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Can you please keep that matter to yourself? It could cause trouble for Yuzuru-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… So he’s threatening you after all.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“…… Yes?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Although he didn’t know what the reason was, Shota thought that she had been ordered not to say too much about the engagement to the outside world.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was because of the threat that Arisa could not ask for help.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“They forced you to get engaged, didn’t they? Haruto-san told me. That Yuzuru Takasegawa …. is threatening you, isn’t he? With money and power, forcibly. Well, if you’re okay with me, I can help you. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You seem to be saying a lot of things as you like.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A chilling voice was heard.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was the voice of the girl in middle school who was shopping with Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…. He was so desperate to talk to Arisa that he forgot all about her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“You are …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I’m Ayumi Takasegawa, younger sister of Yuzuru. To put it simply, you are unpleasant.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The blue-eyed girl, Ayumi, said this in a calm voice and took a step forward.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even though the girl was smaller than him…, she was strangely feisty.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He stepped back involuntarily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“My brother is threatening Arisa-san? On what grounds are you saying that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“N, no… because, political marriage is strange right? It’s wrong right!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Marriage is something you do when you like each other and you fall in love with each other.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It is not right to get married or engaged because of money, profit, or family connections.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In general, it should be wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_11">I am right.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what Shota told himself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi, on the other hand, said ….</p>
	<p class="block_7">“My parents got married in a political marriage. Are you saying that mine and my brother’s birth were wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, not to that extent. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“There are many reasons for marriage, many forms of marriage, and many forms of love.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota couldn’t think of anything to say.</p>
	<p class="block_7">If he had been calm, he might have come up with a counterargument or two, but his mind went blank and he couldn’t think of anything.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So he said on the spur of the moment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Yukishiro-san is being abused.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The moment he said that Arisa’s eyes shook with agitation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It might have hurt Arisa,……, but his mouth did not stop.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“They forced her to get engaged. In exchange for a lot of money! Isn’t it weird! Marrying somebody for money!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi looked a little surprised and opened her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, her expression quickly became calm.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s so weird about that?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, because ……, because of such a thing…….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“I think it’s a common practice to provide financial support to the homes of close relatives, friends, lovers, and even marriage partners. I think it’s pretty common. For a familiar example, …… scholarships require a guarantor, right? It’s the same thing.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“But ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">He somehow felt that it was sophistry.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He couldn’t think of what was sophistry,……, but he had to retort.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota desperately searched for words.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But before that, Ayumi opens her mouth.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“In any case… whoever Takasegawa gives financial assistance to, that’s up to us.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“It, It’s different. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What’s the difference?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“This is…… that’s right! It’s human trafficking!”</p>
	<p class="block_7">The act of buying and selling a person, Arisa, as if she were a commodity, should not be allowed.</p>
	<p class="block_7"><i class="calibre6">This was a crime</i>, Shota argued.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Which is?</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, no, because ……, along with getting engaged, you also paid <span class="calibre5">money …</span>…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“My brother and Arisa’s engagement and my father’s decision to finance Naoki Amagi’s company are two completely different matters.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was like a mechanical voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi said that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was no color of emotion in that expression, it was just mechanical …… and it was very scary.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Well, you can think of it as human trafficking all you want …… but this is a matter between Takasegawa and Amagi. It has nothing to do with you.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Police will…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“The police do not intervene in civil matters. They don’t have the authority to intervene in the business dealings between Takasegawa and Amagi and the engagement of my brother and Arisa-san. …… Isn’t that obvious?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Said Ayumi, mockingly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The police are nothing to be afraid of.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was as if she was saying that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota remembered.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The Takasegawa family has a strong influence in business and political circles.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Shota involuntarily stepped back.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Ayumi then asked Shota further questions as if to convince him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“In the first place, Who are you to Arisa-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“What? No, I am …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">What am I to Arisa?</p>
	<p class="block_7">A lover? That’s not possible.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Friends? They are not that close…</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, I’m …… Yukishiro-san’s neighbor and classmate from middle school. ……”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“So you’re a stranger.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">A stranger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yes,……, Shota is a stranger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">To Arisa, he’s just a stranger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No, no……. I …About Yukishiro-san…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">“When you are just a stranger, please don’t interfere with other people’s engagements.”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then Ayumi raised the corner of her mouth slightly, just for a moment.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Or do you want to marry her? If you’re right, and Arisa-san is really just threatened, then what are your chances?”</p>
	<p class="block_7">His vision whirled around.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His sense of perspective was thrown off.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His eyes were flickering.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“No…”</p>
	<p class="block_7">Without thinking, he looked at Arisa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then …</p>
	<p class="block_7">She looked away awkwardly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He understood it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He knew that what he was saying was incoherent.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He also knows that Arisa doesn’t care about him at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And that …… Arisa has feelings for Yuzuru Takasegawa.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was pitch black in front of his eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Quickly, he tried to escape.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When he turned on his heel, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ah, …….”</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a man with deep blue eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Yuzuru Takasegawa was standing there.</p>
	<p class="block_7">With a somewhat exasperated look on his face, but with a hint of anger in his voice, he said quietly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">“Ayumi. What’s all this fuss about?”</p>
