<h3>Interlude 2 &#8211; Kobayashi's POV</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Warning: Disturbing Content</strong></p>

	<p class="block_7">When I was in the second grade.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She came to my new school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was a very pretty, beautiful girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I fell in love with her at first sight.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When she sat next to me, I was so happy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I thought it was fate.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She always had a cool expression on her face and was unfazed by anything.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But she was never cold and treated everyone with kindness and respect.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When I forgot my textbook and asked her to lend it to me, she would do so without a single expression of displeasure.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was such a good girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Because I liked her, I wanted to get to know her …….　</p>
	<p class="block_7">I went to see her house once.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a winter day in the fourth grade, I believe.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the spur of the moment, I climbed over the high stone wall and peered into the house.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s when I saw it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her mother slapped her on the cheek.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was dragged by her mother into the garden and thrown out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The sound of the glass door slamming shut was unforgettable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was dusk in the middle of winter, and she was shivering in her underwear, looking cold.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I rushed over to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I don’t remember …… what words I said to her at that time.</p>
	<p class="block_7">No, I probably just ran up to her, but I couldn’t say anything to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She gave me a cold look and said one thing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘Don’t get involved with me’</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s all she said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I had no choice but to run away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I later talked to her brother, or rather her cousin.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I learned that she was a girl in a very pitiful situation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Being from an ordinary family, I could not imagine such a world.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wanted to protect her, I wanted to help her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But as a mere child, I had no power to do anything.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I didn’t know what I should do in the first place.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Still, I kept thinking about what I could do to help.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I actually talked to her and helped her with her duties.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Every time I did, she smiled beautifully and said, ‘Thank you ‘.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wish I could close the distance between us little by little like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And once I grow up, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">While I was thinking about this, I was in the sixth grade.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I heard from her cousin that she was going to enter a private junior high school in a slightly better area.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I asked my parents to let me take the entrance exam for the same school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My parents thought I was awakening to the idea of studying, so they gave me their full support and sent me to a cram school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Somehow, I was able to pass.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I thought that the distance between us would be shortened in junior high school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was convinced that our school life would be fun from now on.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Strangely enough, it did not work out that way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe it’s because we’ve both entered puberty.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I began to feel a kind of barrier between men and women.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Club activities were also separated by gender.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In addition, we were unlucky enough to be in the same class only once in junior high school.　</p>
	<p class="block_7">The third year of junior high school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When it was time to take the high school entrance exam, I heard that she was going to enter a private high school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was about a forty to fifty minutes train ride from here.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was a prestigious school located a little far from here.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Apparently, it’s not so much …… one of the top schools in the country, but when I compared my grades with the deviation score and internal application score required for admission to that school, there was a huge gap.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I tried my best to get into the same high school. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But it didn’t go as well as the junior high school entrance exam.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was just one step away from being admitted, but I failed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was in despair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But she and I are neighbors.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I’m sure we’ll meet in the future.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not that we don’t have a chance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even if we can’t go to high school, it would be good if we can enter the same university.</p>
	<p class="block_7">….. However, I was not so optimistic.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I learned for the first time that once a person loses contact with another person, they instantly become distant from each other.</p>
	<p class="block_7">We passed each other once in a while and bade each other goodbye.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That was the extent of our relationship.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A month passed and it was the beginning of May.</p>
	<p class="block_7">During the holidays, I saw her getting into her car wearing a beautiful kimono.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She had a very painful and sad …… expression on her face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I hadn’t seen her face like that since I was in elementary school.</p>
	<p class="block_7">More time passed, and it was July.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On my way home from cram school, I passed by her house and …… ran into her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, the situation was a little different from usual.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was a stranger standing next to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He was a little taller than her, good-looking, and had a relaxed air about him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At first, I thought he was a relative of hers or something.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Because he looked too mature to be a high school student.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He looked so young that I assumed he was probably a college student.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Since I couldn’t imagine that a university student and a high school student would have any contact with each other, I expected that he was probably some kind of young master of the Amagi family.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He introduced himself as a classmate of hers with a very calm voice and expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The first thing that surprised me was that he was the same age as me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">However, now that he mentioned it, it was clear that his well-rounded appearance still had a hint of youth in it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He had been a junior high school student not long ago, just like me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">His language and attitude were very soft and polite.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was standing one step behind him, well-behaved.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was as if she was following him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">And she was glancing at him as if she was checking his mood, his opinion, his instructions.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He’s a bad guy, I thought.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I don’t remember what I said after that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The only thing I know for sure is that I made a good excuse and ran away.<span class="calibre5">　　</span></p>
	<p class="block_7">He was just a classmate.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So, to her, he must be just a guy friend.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was a girl who had received confessions from many boys but had rejected all of them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">There was no way she would start dating a guy who was just a classmate now.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what I told myself.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even so,…… I couldn’t help but be curious about it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Is he really just a classmate?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Are they friends?</p>
	<p class="block_7">Or maybe, just maybe, ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Just thinking about it made me so anxious that I couldn’t sleep.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I didn’t have the courage to ask her directly.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Even if we pass each other, I just bailed.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Those days passed and ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">Eventually, it was September.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One day, I went out with my family to buy some clothes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">I saw her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was about to call out to her, but then I saw that guy next to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She happily picked out some men’s accessories and ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">She pointed to one of them with her finger.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man held the accessory up to his neck.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">She shyly lowered her eyes, blushed, and squirmed, making gestures and expressions as if she was embarrassed as if she liked the guy.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I had never seen that kind of expression on her face before.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was really innocent, cute, beautiful, and …… charming.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was shocked that she, who was so quiet, mature, cool, calm, and never revealing about what she was thinking, showed such emotions on her face like a normal girl.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My heart raced.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My chest was throbbing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Any man would have fallen in love with her if she looked like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was such an attractive expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was very lucky to have been able to see it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It will be a memory that will last a lifetime.</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s why ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s exactly why.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was very painful to know that the destination of that expression was not me.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wanted to look away.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I couldn’t take my eyes off them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I found myself following the two of them.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The two of them were happily looking at accessories.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Pointing at the expensive, ornate jewelry, she spoke to the man.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I couldn’t hear their conversation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I have a pretty good idea of what they are talking about and what they are doing.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Perhaps she is telling the man about her favorite jewels, the ones she likes.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe she is just pleading for it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Maybe she’s pleading with him to give her a present for her birthday or Christmas.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man, on the other hand, listens to her with a serious but relaxed expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Occasionally, a troubled expression appeared on his face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was a little taken aback by her selfishness. ……</p>
	<p class="block_7">But still, if she asks, then let’s buy it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It’s not a big deal if the price is right.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He has that kind of look on his face, and he talks like that.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… I felt that way.</p>
	<p class="block_7">After they left, I checked the price of the accessory she was pointing at.</p>
	<p class="block_7">…… It was an outrageous price.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The price was so high that I didn’t know if I could afford it as a high school student, or as a college student, or even as a working adult.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I was feeling spaced out.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I followed them, feeling like I was intoxicated by alcohol or drugs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">They went into the clothing area.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She picked up an autumn coat with a mature design.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she looks at her purse and sighs.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It was probably not something she could afford with her allowance.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she said something to the man.</p>
	<p class="block_7">One or two words of conversation.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she talked to the shopkeeper and put on the jacket.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then she spoke again to the man.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When the man said something, she smiled happily.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Then …… a little bit, I heard a voice.</p>
	<p class="block_7">‘Because you’re buying it, okay?’</p>
	<p class="block_7">That’s what she said.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She said to the man, bouncy and somewhat insistent.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I get it.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She begged the man to buy her a coat, and he nodded his head.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man took his credit card out of his wallet and easily purchased the expensive, branded coat.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She received a paper bag containing the coat from the shopkeeper.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She hugged it happily with both hands.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The one who doesn’t get acclimated to anyone.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The flower of the high mountain.</p>
	<p class="block_7">A beautiful and solitary lone wolf.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She was …… wagging her tail at the man as if he were a dog or cat that had been fed by his master.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man slowly reached out his hand to her.</p>
	<p class="block_7">He stroked her beautiful, silky hair.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She didn’t seem to resist at all.</p>
	<p class="block_7">On the contrary, she surrenders herself to him.</p>
	<p class="block_7">Her eyes squinted and she looked comfortable.</p>
	<p class="block_7">She really was like a kitten.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I couldn’t stand to look at her enchanted expression.</p>
	<p class="block_7">So I looked at the man’s face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">The man had a …… smirk and a wild grin on his face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">It looks as if he is planning to do something bad.</p>
	<p class="block_7">I wanted to shout out to her, “Don’t be deceived”.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In fact, I wanted to scream.</p>
	<p class="block_7">But I didn’t have the courage …….</p>
	<p class="block_7">I felt nauseous.</p>
	<p class="block_7">When I came to my senses, I was in the men’s room.</p>
	<p class="block_7">At the sink, I washed my face.</p>
	<p class="block_7">In the mirror, a disheveled looking man ……myself, was reflected.</p>
	<p class="block_7">My love life was over before it began.</p>
