<h3>Chapter 27 - Amagi Side</h3>

<p>One day.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Yuzuru texted her, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk to you, let me know a convenient time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa, who had finished washing the dishes, sent him a reply saying, &#8220;Now would be a good time,&#8221; and immediately received a phone call.</p>



<p>It was an invitation to a summer festival.</p>



<p>[&#8220;So, what do you think? I don&#8217;t have a ticket or anything this time, and it&#8217;s kind of a spur-of-the-moment offer from my dad. You can always say no, saying you have something to do.&#8221;]</p>



<p>Unlike the pool, the summer festival was limited to a specific time of the day.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why the excuse that she had to do something she couldn&#8217;t miss at the time works.</p>



<p>&#8220;Summer festival?&#8230;&#8230; Can we see things like fireworks?&#8221;</p>



<p>However, compared to a swimming pool, a festival has a lower psychological hurdle.</p>



<p>Besides, if it means seeing some beautiful fireworks, she was a little curious.</p>



<p>[&#8220;Oh, we can see it &#8230;&#8230;. It&#8217;s pretty decent too.&#8221;]</p>



<p>Arisa hadn&#8217;t been to a summer festival in years.</p>



<p>Maybe since she was in elementary school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you up on your invitation.&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8220;Thank you&#8230;&#8230;. Also, my sister and mother would like to meet you, is that okay?&#8221;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Understood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, after setting a meeting place and time, Arisa hung up the phone.</p>



<p>Then she went back to the living room to report.<br /></p>



<p>&#8220;Who were you on the phone with?&#8221;</p>



<p>The first person who asked her was her foster father.</p>



<p>Naoki.</p>



<p>He unfolded the newspaper and did not even try to face Arisa,&#8230;&#8230;, but had a strong tone that did not let her decline answering.</p>



<p>&#8221; It was Yuzuru Takasegawa-san. &#8230;&#8230; He wanted to know if I would be interested in joining him at the summer festival in a week. I&#8217;ve been invited to go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You were?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Arisa answered, &#8230;&#8230; her adoptive mother &#8211; Emi Amagi &#8211; gave a small tongue click.</p>



<p>A blatantly unhappy expression appeared on her face.</p>



<p>And &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Caught in some distasteful&#8230; romance.&#8221;</p>



<p>-That&#8217;s what she said.　</p>



<p>Arisa’s aunt was not on good terms with Arisa’s mother, who was her sister.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why she hates Arisa, the daughter of her sister.</p>



<p>It is Emi, her foster mother, who is sarcastic and mean to Arisa. And occasionally she raises her hand to Arisa as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;We should not allow it in our house. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t take it, that’s your problem.&#8221;</p>



<p>Naoki said in a cold voice.</p>



<p>Emi held her tongue at that comment.<br /></p>



<p>At first glance, she seems to be at the top of the hierarchy in the family, as Naoki is often away from home for work and leaves the housework and child-raising to Emi.</p>



<p>But strangely enough, she does not disobey only Naoki.</p>



<p>&#8220;This marriage proposal is very important to both Amagi and Arisa. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve talked about this &#8230;&#8230; many times.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand &#8230;&#8230;. Naoki-san.&#8221;<br /></p>



<p>However, Emi had a dissatisfied expression on her face.</p>



<p>Unlike her adoptive father, Naoki, her adoptive mother, Emi, is against this marriage proposal.<br /></p>



<p>Of course, she is not thinking about Arisa.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a story that Arisa can&#8217;t relate to at all. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t like the fact that her niece, who looks just like her sister, whom she hated, is marrying into a wealthy family called Takasegawa, who is well-groomed, elegant, and kind.</p>



<p>To put it simply, she doesn&#8217;t want Arisa to be happy.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t know what happened between Emi and her mother, but it was unreasonable for Arisa.<br /></p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, did you have a yukata with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Naoki abruptly asked Arisa.</p>



<p>Arisa shook her head left and right.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t have one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you plan to go in casual clothes then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Shouldn&#8217;t I? &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the son of an old-fashioned, patriarchal family. He&#8217;ll be wearing a yukata. You&#8217;re going to have to walk beside him in western clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Naoki said as if he was appalled.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a very stupid picture when you think about it.</p>



<p>A Sarashi-wearing person might be better.<br /></p>



<p>When Arisa became quiet, Naoki stood up silently.</p>



<p>He took out his wallet from the drawer and took out five 10,000 yen bills from it.</p>



<p>He placed them on the table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Go and buy something with this. Any extra you have, put it towards your allowance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Th..thank you very much &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;<br /></p>



<p>Without further ado, Arisa took the money.<br /></p>



<p>For Arisa, Naoki is much scarier than Emi, who abuses her.</p>



<p>He never raises his hand at Arisa, and he never says anything mean to her.</p>



<p>On the contrary, he sometimes blames Emi and defends her when she goes too far.</p>



<p>Emi rarely raises her hand against Arisa in front of Naoki.</p>



<p>However, at the same time, he was as close to indifferent to Arisa as possible.</p>



<p>At least that&#8217;s how it seemed to Arisa.</p>



<p>More than she was of the person who had an obvious hatred for her, Arisa was more afraid of Naoki, who she couldn’t tell what&#8217;s on his mind, but was the most influential person in the family.</p>



<p>The fact that he was a grown man who was not related to her at all added to her fear.<br /><br /></p>



<p>&#8220;Naoki-san, don&#8217;t spoil her too much. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a necessary expense.&#8221;</p>



<p>The only thing Naoki cared about was the reputation of his house.</p>



<p>To be precise, he hates the fact that it will affect his business.<br /></p>



<p>&#8220;Arisa. You&#8217;re the one who wanted this marriage to happen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes &#8230;&#8230; I know.&#8221;<br /></p>



<p>Arisa told Yuzuru that she was forced to accept an arranged marriage.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s how she explained it.</p>



<p>But the explanation was &#8230;&#8230; slightly adapted to make it more convenient for Arisa herself.</p>



<p>Naoki, her adoptive father, only asked Arisa, &#8220;I have a few marriage proposals, would you like to consider them?&#8221;. And that&#8217;s all he asked.</p>



<p>It was Arisa who replied that she would try matchmaking.</p>



<p>She was afraid of Naoki, so she couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Naoki brought several marriage proposals to Arisa.</p>



<p>Originally, she didn&#8217;t want to get married, so she kept turning them down.</p>



<p>From Emi&#8217;s point of view, she must have seemed like a selfish and arrogant girl who was choosy about men.</p>



<p>She couldn&#8217;t say no anymore.</p>



<p>Just when she was at a loss, she finally met Yuzuru.<br /></p>



<p>&#8220;Do well. For your own sake.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br /><br /></p>



<p>Is he saying this intending to genuinely support Arisa&#8217;s love life?</p>



<p>Or Is he threatening her that if she breaks it off, &#8230;&#8230; there will be nothing left for her?.</p>



<p>Or is he saying it with a completely different intention?</p>



<p>Arisa didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>But that was enough to terrify her.</p>
