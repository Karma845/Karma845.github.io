<h3>Chapter 26 Takesagawa Side</h3>

<p>A certain place in Japan.</p>



<p>A Japanese-style mansion stood.</p>



<p>The nameplate on the large gate reads &#8220;Takasegawa&#8221;.</p>



<p>A family of four was having dinner in a room with tatami mats.</p>



<p>All four of them were dressed in kimono.　　</p>





<p>&#8220;How are things with Amagi&#8217;s daughter these days, Yuzuru?&#8221;</p>



<p>The person who asked Yuzuru this at the dinner table was &#8230;&#8230; Kazuya Takasegawa.</p>



<p>He is Yuzuru&#8217;s father.</p>



<p>As a quarter, he has a bit of a western look to his appearance.</p>



<p>His blue eyes, which Yuzuru has inherited, clearly prove his genes.</p>



<p>Kazuya was at the arranged marriage with his grandfather, but he didn&#8217;t seem too enthusiastic about Yuzuru and Arisa&#8217;s marriage.</p>



<p>So it was a bit of a surprise for Yuzuru when his father asked him about his relationship with Arisa.</p>



<p>In addition, Yuzuru&#8217;s grandparents, who were the most active in the marriage, were traveling in the US.</p>



<p>They have decided to retire and have been traveling abroad frequently, but &#8230;&#8230; they seem to be particularly fond of the United States.</p>



<p>The mother of Yuzuru&#8217;s grandfather (that is, Yuzuru&#8217;s great-grandmother) is American, so it&#8217;s not surprising.</p>



<p>&#8220;With Yukishiro? &#8230;&#8230; We went to the pool yesterday, right?　It&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru replied appropriately as he took a sip of his miso soup.</p>



<p>His mother&#8217;s miso soup is not bad at all, but &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>( Yukishiro&#8217;s is better. )</p>



<p>It seems like he is already showing symptoms of addiction to Arisa’s homemade food.</p>



<p>The summer vacation is coming to an end and going to school is a hassle, but he still misses Arisa&#8217;s home-cooked meals.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a very complicated feeling.</p>



<p>Perhaps sensing his thoughts, Yuzuru&#8217;s mother &#8211; Sayori Takasegawa, asked him about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which is better, Arisa-san&#8217;s cooking or mine?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yukishiro&#8217;s&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What a quick answer. Aww, Aren’t you deeply in love!　Maybe I&#8217;ll even get to see my grandchildren&#8217;s face soon&#8221;.</p>



<p>After her grandparents, the next person who recommends Yuzuru&#8217;s marriage most is Sayori.</p>



<p>But if anything, she&#8217;s just making a lot of noise because of her fondness for romance.</p>



<p>What are you doing at your age, is what Yuzuru wanted to say. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Perhaps as a result of her youthfulness, she looks young for her age. However, her age is not allowed to be mentioned in front of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom, you&#8217;re not a very good cook. &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s not that difficult to surpass your level.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Yuzuru&#8217;s younger sister- Ayumi Takasegawa, who said that in a dismissive voice.</p>



<p>&#8211;Ayumi Takasegawa.</p>



<p>She is currently in her second year of junior high school.　　</p>



<p>Although her character is a little cheeky, she has a cute appearance &#8230;&#8230; although she is favored because she is the little sister.</p>



<p>Her clear, blue eyes are impressive.</p>



<p>&#8220;But if it&#8217;s that good, I&#8217;d like to try it too. I&#8217;ll give it a rating then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re already feeling like a little sister-in-law&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m amazed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; Whether Niisan is flattering or being serious, I&#8217;ll be curious to know, won&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayumi says aloofly as she ate her pickles.</p>



<p>But&#8230;&#8230;since Yuzuru and Arisa are not getting married, there is no possibility of her becoming a little sister-in-law.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Niisan. Even though you like her so much&#8230;&#8230;., you are still calling her by her last name &#8216;Yukishiro'&#8221;</p>



<p>The younger sister was hitting him where it hurts.</p>



<p>Yuzuru considers himself to be a perceptive person, but &#8230;&#8230; Ayumi is also the type of person who has this kind of intuition.</p>



<p>This is why one can&#8217;t let their guard down.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s a bit embarrassing to change the way you call someone&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fu~u~n&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ayumi was not particularly inquisitive.</p>



<p>She was smirking, though, cheekily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;, things may be a little awkward right now, Yuzuru. If you&#8217;re willing to like each other, you&#8217;ll be able to fall for each other. An arranged marriage is not as bad as it seems.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I was also worried about whether it would be possible for me to get along with Kazuya-san at first &#8230;&#8230;But when I looked for it, I found a lot of wonderful aspects of him.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s started again.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Ayumi looked at their parents with an expression that said so.</p>



<p>Their parents, Kazuya and Sayori, were brought together in an arranged marriage.</p>



<p>So they are quite favorable towards arranged marriages.</p>



<p>They are probably thinking of suggesting some form of matchmaking to Ayumi as well.</p>



<p>However, they will not force her to do so.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if that&#8217;s how it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayumi was not so negative about the idea of an arranged marriage either, probably because she had seen Yuzuru getting along well with his fiancee as well as their parents.</p>



<p>In fact, Yuzuru himself does not dislike arranged marriages.</p>



<p>He just thinks that it would be too early for a fifteen-year-old.</p>



<p>If it had been after he graduated from university, he would not have protested.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217; right, Yuzuru. &#8230;&#8230; There&#8217;s a summer festival nearby in a week, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kazuya suddenly started to say something like that.</p>



<p>Yuzuru immediately understood his father&#8217;s intentions.</p>



<p>&#8220;You want me to invite Yukishiro?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You’re very quick on the uptake. Well, I wouldn&#8217;t force it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Having said that, it would be a bit odd if Yuzuru didn&#8217;t invite his girlfriend to a festival in the neighborhood.</p>



<p>Inevitably, he would have to invite Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, &#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;re right. But is Ayumi okay with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>Until last year, Yuzuru had gone to the summer festival with Ayumi.</p>



<p>Are you okay without your brother&#8217;s escort?　Yuzuru asked his sister.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have friends too. But you have to introduce me to her. I only know her from her picture, my brother&#8217;s beloved.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>While replying randomly to her&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>I have to call Arisa again, Yuzuru was thinking.</p>
