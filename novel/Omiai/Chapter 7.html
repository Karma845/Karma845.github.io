<h3>Chapter 7 - Beginner</h3>

<p>“I won again”</p>



<p>As expected even Arisa will feel happy when she wins a game. Her usual cool expression was a little loose.</p>



<p>The corner of her mouth was slightly raised and the corner for her eyes were slightly down. However, in her emerald eyes&#8230;as usual, there was no light.</p>



<p>I was a little disappointed, but&#8230;when I saw Arisa’s cute expression, I thought it wasn’t bad to lose.</p>



<p>It’s not that I like it, but the smile of a beautiful girl is still good for your eyes.</p>



<p>“Is there something on my face?”</p>



<p>“No, no&#8230;I thought you were really good for a beginner .”</p>



<p>I replied to Arisa, who was tilting her head curiously, while dodging her question.</p>



<p>I can’t tell her that I was looking at her face because I thought it was cute.</p>



<p>“You don’t play games at your home?”</p>



<p>“I don&#8217;t have &#8230;&#8230; much of a chance to play it. My adoptive mother has a negative attitude towards games, and also &#8230;&#8230; that, if I do play, she gets angry at me. If you have time to play, study, she says.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>



<p>I felt it at the time of the matchmaking, but it seems that Airisa&#8217;s position at the Amagi family is not very good. Maybe there are games at her home,&nbsp; but at least it seems that Arisa rarely gets a chance to play a game with the other children of the Amagi family.</p>



<p>That’s why she came all the way to my house to play the game.</p>



<p>“Takasegawa-san&#8230;you’re lousy at it though.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to say it like that.”</p>



<p>“But you are really lousy.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to say it twice. &#8230;You can also make a joke like that.”</p>



<p>”Did you think I was a person who couldn&#8217;t make a single joke?”</p>



<p>Arisa glared at me with an annoyed expression. When I cowered my shoulders, she rephrased.</p>



<p>“I’m also not very good at it, but don’t you usually play these games?”</p>



<p>“Hmm &#8230; I don&#8217;t play a lot of games in the first place.”</p>



<p>“Even though you have so many?”</p>



<p>Airisa said with a sideways glance at the game I had prepared for her. There are fifty of them, including the latest and the oldest ones. From an outsider&#8217;s perspective, it would look like I am a game lover.</p>



<p>“I am bored so…”</p>



<p>“As expected, are you the type who gets satisfied by buying things?”</p>



<p>“As expected?”</p>



<p>“Because the kitchen was uselessly well-equipped with &#8230;iron cooker, pressure cooker, etc.”</p>



<p>I had a number of exaggerated cooking utensils for a man who doesn&#8217;t cook much. From this, Arisa must have guessed that I was a &#8220;buy-but-don&#8217;t-use&#8221; kind of person.</p>



<p>&#8230;I can’t deny it because I am in the wrong here.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m sure there were a lot of muscle training equipment in the living room, right?”</p>



<p>“Oh &#8230; Well, I use it occasionally. I&#8217;ve been doing &#8230; muscle training itself, okay?　I do go to the gym sometimes with my friends though.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t tell such a silly lie. Do you want to confirm?”</p>



<p>I asked her “If you don&#8217;t believe me, I&#8217;ll show you the proof&#8221; while grabbing my shirt, and Arisa turned away in a hurry with her white skin changing into vermilion.</p>



<p>“No, no&#8230;it’s fine.”</p>



<p>As I thought, she is not immune to men.</p>



<p>I was convinced that the reason why she was said to be cute was not only her appearance but also her personality and gestures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s right, Yukishiro. Are you thirsty?”</p>



<p>She is too cute, but it will be awkward if she keeps looking embarrassed forever.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I asked her to change the topic.</p>



<p>It’s about half past two.</p>



<p>It’s a good time to have a snack.</p>



<p>“Oh, then I’ll have some.”</p>



<p>“Okay&#8230;Is coffee good?”</p>



<p>“Okay, Do you have milk and sugar?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I have them. Then, I’m brewing now.”</p>



<p>Even if you say brewing, it does not mean that you make it by boiling water.</p>



<p>Simply place the mug in the coffee maker installed in the kitchen and press the button.</p>



<p>And the coffee will be ready.</p>



<p>I returned to the living room, holding the two mugs in both hands, and placed them on the table.</p>



<p>Arisa raised her eyebrow slightly.</p>



<p>“It’s fast.”</p>



<p>“I have a coffee maker.”</p>



<p>“I see, so that mechanical sound was from the coffee maker .”</p>



<p>“That&#8217;s right &#8230; I&#8217;ll bring you milk and sugar.”</p>



<p>I said so and went back to the kitchen to get milk and sugar. Then I took out the cake I bought from the refrigerator.</p>



<p>“I’m back.”</p>



<p>“Welcome back. &#8230;Takasegawa-san, isn&#8217;t that from the famous place in your neighborhood?”</p>



<p>It seems she noticed the cake I brought. Her expression quickly recovered, but&#8230;she kept glancing at the box.</p>



<p>“Oh, you also knew. Can you eat sweets?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I like sweets as much as anyone else.”</p>



<p>That’s good to hear, I opened the box with a relief. There are two shortcakes and two chocolate cakes inside.</p>



<p>“Which one do you like?”</p>



<p>“Well, uh&#8230;please wait.”</p>



<p>Arisa began to worry, grunting and groaning, with a serious expression on her face. Her jade-colored eyes moved repeatedly from side to side.</p>



<p>After much deliberation, she chose the shortcakes.</p>



<p>By a process of elimination, I got the chocolate cake</p>



<p>I put it on the plate and started eating immediately</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>Because It was from a well known store, It was really good.</p>



<p>After checking the taste of the cake&#8230;I looked at Arisa’s expression.</p>



<p>Impressions&#8230;I didn&#8217;t need to hear.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m glad you were pleased.)</p>



<p>Her expression was relaxed, the cheeks were slightly red as she brought the cake to her mouth.</p>



<p>As soon as it was in her mouth, her eyes squinted and her small mouth drew a small arc.</p>



<p>The corner of her eye slightly dropped and she had a dreamy expression.</p>



<p>Then she sipped the coffee and instantly frowned.</p>



<p>It seems like milk and sugar were not enough.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; What are you laughing at?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sorry. It was funny.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a rude person.&#8221;</p>



<p>She raised her eyebrows in annoyance. The way she said that, but also threw milk and sugar cubes into the coffee was a bit ridiculous.</p>



<p>“Sorry, It was my bad. …but I am glad you are pleased.”</p>



<p>When I said that with a little laugh, Airisa looked dissatisfied.</p>



<p>However, the hand that moves the fork did not stop.</p>



<p>And when she puts the cake in her mouth, her facial expression becomes soft immediately.</p>



<p>“Well, I&#8217;ll forgive you. But&#8230;Takasegawa-san, you also know about these stores.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well I go there relatively often. With my friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I said that, Arisa was astonished! Her eyes were wide open with surprise.</p>



<p>She was so surprised that she froze, holding a fork in her hands.</p>



<p>“Oh, come on, your reaction is too much.”</p>



<p>“Oh, oh &#8230;&#8230; sorry. When you say friend, do you mean, um, class friends?”</p>



<p>“No. Soichiro Satake and Sei Ryozenji &#8230; do you understand?”</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve heard of these names. I&#8217;m not sure if the name matches the face, though.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been less than two months since I entered the school. Although, I remember the faces of people in my same class, but it’s normal to not remember the faces of the people from other classes.</p>



<p>Rather, just knowing their name will be a surprise.</p>



<p>“What&#8217;s up with those guys. Are they famous?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Among the girls in my class &#8230;&#8230; sometimes their names come up. Well, they’re famous for their well-organized features.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve got a good face.”</p>



<p>However, if you ask me if I am perfect as a human being and a man, I can&#8217;t help but tilt my head back.</p>



<p>Especially Soichiro.</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8211;But, though.”</p>



<p>Airisa mumbled something to herself.</p>



<p>The voice was too small to be heard.</p>



<p>“What did you say?”</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing.”</p>



<p>I asked her, but she replied back with an expression that says she is done speaking.</p>
