<h3>Chapter 9 - Family Circumstances of Fiancee</h3>

<p>After the meal, Yuzuru decided to send Arisa home.</span></p>

<p>Arisa insisted that it was okay to just leave at the station ... Although it's getting brighter these days, hewas reluctant to let the girl walk the night road.</span></p>
<p>In the first place, Arisa's return was delayed because she served Yuzuru for dinner.</span></p>
<p>"Mr. Takasegawa is surprisingly gentlemanly."</span></p>
<p>Suddenly, Arisa said that as if she was impressed.</span></p>
<p>Apart from that, Yuzuru does not see himself a gentleman at all, but "unexpected" is a little regrettable.</span></p>
<p>"What is surprising? What is unexpected?"</span></p>
<p>"If you feel uncomfortable, I'm sorry, but ... I casually saw myself walking on the side of the road, and I think there are places like that."</span></p>
<p>It is the teaching of parents and grandparents to walk along the sidewalk when walking alongside a girl.</span></p>
<p>The Takasegawa family is just such a house, although it is a little old-fashioned way of thinking that a man must protect a woman ... in view of this time.</span></p>
<p>"It's a parent's discipline. I have to say that we are a house with old-fashioned values and a feudal climate. If you are a man, protect a woman. Well ... I couldn't practice it when I was on crutches. But "</span></p>
<p>When Yuzuru said so, Arisa was silent.</span></p>
<p>The face is slightly down.</span></p>
<p>The neat appearance illuminated by the streets ... was slightly sunk.</span></p>
<p>"Maybe I caused a nuisance?"</span></p>
<p>"Yeah? ... Why?"</span></p>
<p>"Because of me ... I think Mr. Takasegawa got angry with his parents ..."</span></p>
<p>In other words, it is against the teachings of the house that Yuzuru, a man, is protected by Arisa, a woman, so it may be that Yuzuru was scolded by her parents ...</span></p><p>It seemed that he had such a concern.</span></p>
<p>"No way! No matter what, there is no such fossil value. In the first place, my parents are free-spirited. I just care too much."</span></p><p>"... Is that so? That's fine."</span></p>
<p>Arisa takes a breather.</span></p>
<p>However, a slight color of melancholy remained in the expression.</span></p>
<p>She still seemed worried that Yuzuru would be scolded by his parents for his actions.</span></p>

<p>"Is Yukishiro all right after that?"</span></p>

<p>"... After that?"</span></p>
<p>Arisa did not answer Yuzuru's question.</span></p>
<p>However, her cloudy expression and silence eloquently showed that Yuzuru's concerns were true.</span></p>
<p>"Have you been scolded?"</span></p><p>

<p>Arisa said in a refusing voice.</span></p><p>&#12288;</span>It's like pushing something away, creating a wall between her and Yuzuru.</span></p>
<p>But ... at the same time, it looked terribly sad and painful.</span></p>
<p>Yuzuru decides that it will only hurt her, saying that even if she steps in forcibly, she will be refused.</span></p>
<p>"If you say so, I won't step into your situation."</span></p>
<p>"I don't think it's annoying, though."</span></p>
<p>Then Yuzuru doesn't look at Arisa and keeps facing the front ... Speaks like a soliloquy.</span></p>
<p>"Because I became a fiancé, I'm not someone else in terms of your family situation."</span></p>
<p>Yuzuru tells Arisa that way, and then says it again.</span></p>
<p>"But I'm not your true fiancée. So I respect your will. If it's a sword, it's a sword. If it's annoying, it's a nuisance. If you don't like it, you don't like it. I hope you can express your feelings clearly. "</span></p>
<p>After a brief silence, Arisa replied Yuzuru with a clear voice.</span></p>
<p>"At the moment, I'm not going to ask Takasegawa-san for help. It's a little exaggerated ... I'm sorry."</span></p>
<p>"Well, that's right."</span></p>
<p>If Yuzuru went to Arisa's parents to nail her, He doesn't know if they would do what Yuzuru intended.</span></p>
<p>Unless you're very stupid, that can be terrible if you're stupid.</span></p>
<p>Arisa will not be able to take such a risk, and Yuzuru cannot take responsibility.</span></p>
<p>"But Takasegawa san"</span></p>
<p>"Yeah?"</span></p>
<p>"Thank you for respecting my will. I'm genuinely happy there."</span></p>
<p>Arisa's voice was much softer than usual.</span></p>
<p>After a while, they arrived at a position where he could see Arisa's home.</span></p>
<p>Arisa turned to Yuzuru and thanked him, saying that this was all right.</span></p>
<p>"Thank you for today. It was fun."</span></p>
<p>Arisa's expression was the same as usual, with a clear face.</span></p>
<p>However, he felt that there was no lie in that word.</span></p>
<p>"I enjoyed it too. The food was delicious."</span></p>
<p>"Let's take that impression honestly .... I had you eat a lot."</span></p>
<p>Arisa nodded a little to Yuzuru's compliment.</span></p>
<p>Then, after showing a little thought, ... she opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"Takasegawa-san .... Is it okay to go play the game next week? I'll cook and play in."</span></p>
<p>"Next week? Oh, that's fine. There are some things that I haven't touched yet .... But I don't need a" replacement ".</span></p>
<p>Yuzuru didn't want to force Arisa to cook.</span></p>
<p>For the price of letting me play a game and having a little cake, it's a little overkill for Yuzuru's values to have him cook.</span></p>
<p>"That's not the case .... Let's change the word. Let me make it. It's easier."</span></p>
<p>She spoke someting in light tone.</p>
<p>"Oh ... that's what it is"</span></p>
<p>Not serving Yuzuru means going home early and cooking at the Amagi family.</p>
<p>Yuzuru doesn't know the detailed family structure of the Amagi family, but ... Yuzuru and Arisa may be easier in terms of labor.</span></p>
<p>In other words, she wants to skip.</span></p><p>"Let's be happy to cooperate .... Can you come to make it every day?"</span></p>
<p>When Yuzuru says so in half a joke ...</span></p>
<p>"Fufu ... I'll think about it."</span></p>
<p>Arisa smiled, not knowing whether he was kidding or serious.</span></p>
<p>Every Saturday, Arisa goes to Yugen's house, plays games, cooks dinner and goes home.</span></p>
<p>Such a relationship lasted for about a month.</span></p>
<p>Mid-June.</span></p>
<p>"Yes, hello. What do you need, old man?"</span></p>
<p>"Do you need something to call your grandson?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>"Have you ever called me when I have no use? Get it fast."</span></p>
<p>When Yuzuru replies, that's true, but he complains that he doesn't have to be so cold.</span></p>
<p>When the impatient Yuzuru tries to hurry again ...</span></p>
<p>"Do you know what day it will be in a week? &#8220;</span></p>
<p>"I don't know"</span></p>
<p>"It's not the case when you're fooling around, right? It's an important day&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Even if it's an important day, you don't know what you don't know.</span></p>
<p>When he was wondering what day it was ...</span></p><p>"birthday. It's Amagi's daughter's birthday. "</span></p>
<p>"Ah, by the way ... was that so?"</span></p>
<p>Before the matchmaking, her date of birth should have been written when she showed me the materials.</span></p>
<p>You can see it (as you can see), but it's a little earlier than Yuzuru's birthday.</span></p>
<p>"Absolutely ... are you really going to give a present to your fiancé?</p>
<p>"No&#8230;"</span></p>

<p>Her birthday was completely blind.</span></p>
<p>If you are a close lover, you should know each other's birthdays.</span></p>
<p>"I'm grateful, old man. Yeah, I'll have a present ready."</span></p>
<p>"Um. ...... Show your great-grandchildren soon. "</span></p>
<p>"Then live longer for another six years. I'm not going to get married until I graduate from college."</span></p>
<p>Yuzuru said so and hung up.</span></p>
<p>"Well, what should I do?"</span></p>
<p>&#12288;</span>Yuzuru sighed.</span></p>
