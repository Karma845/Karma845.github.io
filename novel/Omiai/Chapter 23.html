<h3>Chapter 23 - Girl's Side</h3>


<p>A few hours later the five of us started playing together.</p>



<p>Ayaka and Chiharu started to say something like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m hungry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry too!&#8221;</p>



<p>They both insisted on Yuzuru and Soichiro.</p>



<p>Without thinking, Yuzuru and Soichiro looked at each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite a big deal.&#8221;</p>



<p>And Ayaka and Chiharu looked blatantly unhappy.</p>



<p>The two of them pulled on Arisa’s hand, who was feeling puzzled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Arisa. Arisa is also a bit peckish, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to eat something salty?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; Eh? Ah well, I did move my body, so I can&#8217;t deny that sort of feeling. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa seemed to be unsure of Ayaka and Chiharu&#8217;s intentions.</p>



<p>But for the two of them, whether Arisa understood their intentions didn&#8217;t seem to matter that much.</p>



<p>They nodded their heads repeatedly, exaggeratedly, and dramatically.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hungry, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>



<p>Chira Chira. (<strong>TN: </strong><em>Glancing SFX</em><strong>)</strong></p>





<p>And then they looked at Yuzuru and Soichiro.</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, one of the requirements for a gentleman is whether or not he is thoughtful.&#8221;</p>



<p>“I can understand that. If a girl is hungry, it&#8217;s nice to have someone who will buy her something without saying a word&#8230;&#8230; Arisa-san, you think so too, right?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? No, no &#8230;&#8230;, but that&#8217;s something &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>When Arisa finally understood Ayaka and Chiharu&#8217;s intentions, she shook her head and tried to deny them.</p>



<p>But the two of them interrupted her, saying in a loud and deliberate voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, a lovely childhood friend is hungry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder what he is doing when his fiancée seems to be hungry too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Soichiro sighed.</p>



<p>First, Soichiro asked Ayaka and Chiharu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha~a, &#8230;&#8230; what should I get for you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have yakisoba.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Takoyaki is good for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>As long as Soichiro was buying, Yuzuru had no choice but to accompany him.</p>



<p>Yuzuru asked his fiancée, who looked confused.</p>



<p>&#8221; What about you, Yukishiro?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221;Well, um, &#8230;&#8230; that &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m also free anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said that, Arisa put her hand on her white slender stomach.</p>



<p>Then she blushed slightly and her pink lips moved while squirming.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have some French fries, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Yuzuru and Soichiro turned on their heels &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, and a drink, please!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be waiting over there!&#8221;</p>



<p>The voices of their childhood friends were heard from behind them.</p>



<p>Yuzuru and Soichiro looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders.</p>





<p>&#8220;Okay, there they go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They left, didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>After seeing off Yuzuru and Soichiro, Ayaka and Chiharu crowded Airisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh well,&#8230;&#8230;what&#8217;s this about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a little girl talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to ask you a lot of questions, Arisa-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was taken to a chair by the two of them and made to sit down.</p>



<p>Then Ayaka and Chiharu sat in a position that exactly sandwiched Airisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, Arisa-chan. &#8230;&#8230; What do you think of Yuzuru?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka asked Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Arisa exclaimed in surprise at the sudden question.</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you like him as a man?&#8221;</p>



<p>Chiharu expressly asked Arisa.</p>



<p>At that Arisa’s skin became slightly flushed.</p>



<p>Then she shook her head from side to side.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way!&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t have any romantic feelings for him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka and Chiharu tilted their heads in response to Arisa’s answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuzuru, at school he’s a bit sloppy. But when he&#8217;s dressed up, I think he’s pretty cool.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I also think he has a great personality. But what is there to not be satisfied with him?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then again, Arisa shook her head from side to side.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not that &#8230;&#8230; I think Takasegawa-san is a wonderful man, but &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa lowered her eyes in embarrassment.</p>



<p>After a few moments of hesitation, she spoke up clearly.</p>



<p>&#8220;But even so, having romantic feelings for him is a different thing, isn’t it?.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if Yuzuru is wonderful as a man&#8230;&#8230;., it is not a reason enough to fall in love with him.</p>



<p>This was the case with Ayaka and Chiharu, who only had feelings for Yuzuru as a best friend of the opposite sex.</p>



<p>This is the reason why the two of them easily backed off.</p>



<p>&#8230;.is not what happened.</p>



<p>&#8220;So what would you do if Yuzuru told you that he likes you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;F~u~e?&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa was caught off guard by the sudden question, which made her yelp in surprise.</p>



<p>Her pure white skin turned crimson.</p>



<p>&#8220;No. That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; that is not possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just a hypothetical. Don&#8217;t you think you could try out a dating relationship?&#8221;</p>



<p>While Arisa shook her head repeatedly, Chiharu asked with a smirk on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I cannot be that disloyal! And besides, &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8221; &#8220;Besides?&#8221; &#8220;</p>



<p>Arisa gave a small sigh.</p>



<p>Then she said in a weak voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are much more suitable women for Takasegawa-san than me, &#8230;&#8230;. He’s such a fine man.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa laughed a little after saying that.</p>



<p>Rather than a laugh of joy, it was a self-mocking, self-deprecating laugh.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how it is?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ayaka and Chiharu seemed to be convinced of something.</p>



<p>While Arisa was being puzzled, they both smiled at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for asking such a strange question. Arisa-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no&#8230; It&#8217;s okay&#8230;&#8230;.You guys and Takasegawa-san are childhood friends, right? I think it&#8217;s natural to be curious.&#8221;</p>



<p>While they were talking about this, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, we’re back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I bought some drinks, so you can choose what you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soichiro and Yuzuru came back.</p>



<p>The three girls greeted the two men with smiles on their faces, as if nothing had happened.</p>
