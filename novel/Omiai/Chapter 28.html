<h3>Chapter 28 - Four Hounds</h3>

<p>The day of the summer festival.</p>



<p>Yuzuru went out to pick up Arisa from the station a little early.</p>



<p>The station was crowded with men and women like Yuzuru, waiting for their friends or lovers.</p>



<p>Yuzuru waited for Arisa at a distance.</p>



<p>(What kind of yukata will Arisa bring?)</p>



<p>Yuzuru thought to himself. He had not yet put on his yukata.</p>



<p>What he was wearing was an outfit for going out.</p>



<p>This was because Arisa had informed him that she didn&#8217;t want to get the yukata dirty, so if it was possible, she would like to change it at Takasegawa-san&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>If that was the case, Yuzuru thought he would change then as well.</p>



<p>As he gazed absently at the yukata of the women in his line of vision, he imagined Arisa in her yukata. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Takasegawa-san. Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly he heard the usual calm voice that was typical of her.</p>



<p>He turned in the direction of the voice and found Arisa standing there with her usual poker face on.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I just got here&#8221;</p>



<p>She was wearing casual clothes, but she had two paper bags in her hands.</p>



<p>Perhaps one of them contained a yukata.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230; So, what&#8217;s the other one?</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s in those bags?&#8221;</p>



<p>“The yukata and &#8230;&#8230; some sweets. He told me to take them with me if I was going to greet everyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>The words probably came from her adoptive father.</p>



<p>Although Yuzuru hasn’t exchanged many words with him directly, from what he heard from Arisa and his parents, Naoki Amagi seems to be a man who cares about appearances.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s better to care than not to care at all, so I guess there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p>



<p>Whether or not it&#8217;s accompanied by substance is another matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall I carry it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then please take the yukata. I&#8217;d like to give the sweets to Takasegawa-san&#8217;s parents with my own hands.&#8221;</p>



<p>After accepting one of the paper bags, Yuzuru lightly beckoned to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to the house. Please follow me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8230; I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru&#8217;s house was a short walk from the station.</p>



<p>As they reached the front of the gate, he stopped.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; here, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked up at the gate and had a dumbfounded expression on her face.</p>



<p>Her mouth was wide open.</p>



<p>If anything, Yuzuru, who knows the normal Arisa, thought she looked a bit &#8221; daft &#8220;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s just that &#8230;&#8230; it is so big.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have a big house too, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have such a high wall or a big gate.&#8221;</p>



<p>When they went through the outer gate, &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>There were multiple loud dog barks in the distance.</p>



<p>Arisa’s body shivered slightly in fear.</p>



<p>In the meantime, four dogs came running towards them.</p>



<p>They were wagging their tails as they rushed towards Yuzuru.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru commanded, and the four dogs stopped immediately.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sit.&#8221;</p>



<p>When he ordered them with a gesture, the four dogs sat down, although there was a time delay.</p>



<p>At first, Arisa was taken aback, but soon she showed a hint of admiration on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re well-behaved, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re guard dogs, so we let them run free in the yard.&#8221;</p>



<p>But so far they had never been of any use in Yuzuru&#8217;s life.</p>



<p>No burglar would want to enter a house where there was the occasional barking of a dog.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I touch them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure. Say hello to them a bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuzuru then beckoned to the four dogs, calling out their names as he did so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexander.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then one of them, a reddish-brown dog with a dignified face, walked up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, sit, hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexander put his feet on Yuzuru&#8217;s hands as ordered.</p>



<p>He patted his head lightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;This kid is the highest on the pecking order in that group. &#8230;&#8230; Let him smell you first, and then touch him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean he&#8217;s the leader? Is it &#8230;&#8230; Shiba Inu?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s an Akita Inu.&#8221; (<strong>TN: </strong><em>Dog breeds)</em></p>



<p>The first thing Arisa did was to extend her white hand to the Akita.</p>



<p>The Akita dog sniffed her lightly.</p>



<p>Then she gently stroked its neck and head.</p>



<p>Then she greeted the black-furred dog, the reddish-brown-furred dog, and the brown-furred dog with a black face and saggy skin.</p>



<p>One by one, Yuzuru told Arisa their names.</p>



<p>&#8220;Those are great names&#8230;&#8230;. Alexander, Pyrrhus, Hannibal, and Scipio. &#8230;&#8230; What are you going to fight against?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thieves, maybe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an overpowering force. &#8230;&#8230; The name is one thing, but the size?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Arisa looked at the four dogs.</p>



<p>Two of the dogs, including the Akita, were the size of normal large dogs, but the other two were even larger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexander is an Akita, and Pyrrhus is a &#8230;&#8230; German Shepherd, right?　And what breeds are Hannibal and Scipio &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>The dog named Hannibal is about eighty centimeters tall.</p>



<p>And Scipio is slightly taller than that.</p>



<p>Both of them seemed to have a face as big as two of Arisa’s.</p>



<p>No matter how docile they are, even Airisa&#8217;s face twitched a bit as she was pressured by the approach of a Mastiff of this size.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hannibal is a Spanish Mastiff and Scipio is an English Mastiff. Well, it&#8217;s not like all four of them have any real combat experience. We&#8217;ve never been robbed, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a life and death kind of thing. If you do your research, you won&#8217;t be entering.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though she said that Arisa’s expression was soft.</p>



<p>Her eyes were melting, and her mouth was slack.</p>



<p>She professes to be a cat person, but it seems that she also likes dogs.</p>



<p>Yosh, yosh&#8230; she pets the four heads.</p>



<p>“Well, Yukishiro. It&#8217;s about time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so. &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s not a good idea to take too long or to get your clothes dirty before a greeting &#8220;</p>



<p>When Yuzuru said this, Arisa stood up with a regretful expression on her face.</p>



<p>Ordering them to disperse, the four dogs ran off to somewhere in the garden.</p>



<p>After seeing the dogs off, Yuzuru opened the sliding door leading to the front door.</p>



<p>Then he shouted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve brought Yukishiro!&#8221;</p>



<p></p>



<p>After a while, three people dressed in kimonos appeared.</p>



<p>Father, Kazuya Takasegawa.</p>



<p>Mother, Sayori Takasegawa.</p>



<p>Sister, Ayumi Takasegawa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for coming, Arisa-san. My son has always been taken care of by you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while. Takasegawa-san &#8230;&#8230; Yuzuru-san has been rather helpful to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that Arisa politely greeted him.</p>



<p>Kazuya slowly squinted his eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, please come in at once. I&#8217;m sure two people are itching to talk to you&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kazuya said and lightly glanced behind him.</p>



<p>Sayuri and Ayumi were ready and waiting for her.</p>



<p>Yuzuru was the first to take off his geta and went up to the house.</p>



<p>Then he reached out his hand to Airisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>As Arisa went into the house, the two women came out.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Sayuri Takasegawa, Yuzuru&#8217;s mother. Yuzuru has always been taken care of by you, Arisa-san. &#8230;..You&#8217;re much prettier in person than you are in the photos.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am his sister, Ayumi Takasegawa. My brother has been indebted to you. You are really beautiful, aren&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s no wonder my brother is crazy about you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Arisa Yukishiro. Please take care of me.. &#8230;&#8230; Oh, um, &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arisa looked perplexed as the two of them were pressing in on her.</p>



<p>Yuzuru stepped forward and stood as if to protect Arisa.</p>



<p>&#8221; Yukishiro seems to be troubled. &#8230;&#8230; We can talk over a cup of tea, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Yuzuru beckoned lightly to Airisa.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you around.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. &#8230;&#8230; Please take care of me today&#8221;</p>



<p>Once again, Arisa bowed.</p>
