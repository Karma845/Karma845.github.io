<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Spydog</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>It was a princess room a girl would wish for. The bed was pink and the bed sheet was sky blue. The chair and the bookshelf was also pink.</p>

<p>In a pink room like that there was a girl who wore a sexy police woman’s outfit which was exposing her belly and she was patting a robot dog.</p>

<p>“It would be pointless to keep on sneaking into their base until we find a powerful enemy~. I kept it as a secret from the other two but I may have found something~.”</p>

<p>The robot dog narrowed its eyes.</p>

<p>“Spydog-chan. You need to enter their base and search what is inside it.”</p>

<p>The robot dog responded with a cry.</p>

<p>“Then you must go now.”</p>

<p>Then the robot dog activated its camouflage mode and it was nowhere to be seen. Few seconds later the noise of the door being shut was heard.</p>

<p>The girl then positioned herself in front of her laptop. The camera which had been installed on the robot dog was sending the vision to the laptop.</p>

<p>“Now then. Let’s see if this will go accordingly♪”</p>

<p>Aizenaha was taking a shower at the captain’s room. She was being washed by the hot water with the right temperature within the booth made from glasses.</p>

<p>(No.28…)</p>

<p>Aizenaha remembered the young face of that high school boy.</p>

<p>(It must have been a fluke when he hit the target with the numb-ball yesterday. They say that there are times when fortunes are bestowed to people to make a miracle happen. That must have happened to that boy yesterday by luck.)</p>

<p>Demonia PPO lacked in human resources. The combatants continued to be wounded and in order to compensate for that loss they would promote a service-staff. However, they were in a situation where they couldn’t be satisfied with the man power due to the combatants either being wounded or not being fit for being one. She had heard the scouts squads were searching for those with potentials. But she never expected them to recruit a high school boy.</p>

<p>However, that wouldn’t be enough to make Aizenaha feel pity for others. He must had a certain determination to join Demonia PPO. Since he had joined he would be required to fulfill his duty as a service-staff.</p>

<p>(Even so—.)</p>

<p>Aizenaha remembered the experience she had yesterday.</p>

<p>(The way that boy fondled my breast felt great. He realized I had an inverted nipples right away and started arousing me with his fingers. They say that the hands of human are different from Demonians. It’s not all of them but apparently there are those who has an exceptional hands. That boy must be one of them.)</p>

<p>Aizenaha thought she should have made him her breast-fondler. But he was so young. He might get too full of himself if he becomes a breast-fondler.</p>

<p>Aizenaha believed that a breast-fondler also must be a combatant at the same time. If it was for just groping then they could just summon them when they were needed.</p>

<p>Lately the Saint Agents had been intruding repeatedly. At times it was just one of them. Sometimes there were two of them. They were acting as if they were trying to estimate the man power of Demonia PPO.</p>

<p>(At the moment Belzeria-sama is observing them quietly. She is collecting data by sending others instead of going out herself.)</p>

<p>What was known at the moment was that there were three Agents. The names of the three Agents were Pink Police, Red Scholar, and Blue Gorgeous. They all carried a weapon and specialized in long-range attack.</p>

<p>They had started appearing since six months ago. There was just one of them in the beginning, then there were two, and now there were three. It was not known whether there would be a fourth.</p>

<p>(Belzeria-sama intends on taking the enemy off guard rather than heading out herself so we could attack the enemy at the best chance there is and eliminate much Saint Agents as we can. For that reason we need skilled dark knights as well as skilled combatants. Though the number of people the Demonia Planet would send us were limited. So we must find people here on Earth.)</p>

<p>Aizenaha turned the shower off and left the booth. She used the towel to wipe her beautiful breasts.</p>

<p>(It’s a bit past 3:30pm right now. It’s about time that boy would arrive. He’s scheduled to do labor work at the underground factory from 4 o’clock. Should I call him over when he is done?)</p>

<p>(But I feel a bit shy. I don’t want Balanka and others to jeer me for calling over such a young boy. Should I go and call him quietly…?)</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>



<p>It was around 3:30pm when Yoh arrived at the Breast Cloud Temple. He came here quickly from the Globaria academy with his bicycle.</p>

<p>The hidden passage to the base was inside the temple located deep within the mountains. The rule was to come here to act as if you were here to give prayers and clean the floor. Yoh went into the area where they kept the tools and approached the wall while he stood upside down. Then suddenly he was taken to the world at the other side—border transgression to the base.</p>

<p>When he descended to the underground with the camouflage elevator the door opened. He walked through the long corridor and went to the right passage of the T-intersection. When he was about to enter the locker room he noticed a combatant who was walking around with his mask in his hand. He also saw Yoh and made a sound.</p>

<p>The combatant was the fatty who kept on making complaints— Ton Tonno who was in the same class as him. He was holding a mask with a Z symbol on it in his hand.</p>

<p>“You…were a combatant?”</p>

<p>“So you realize it just now, grunt.”</p>

<p>Tonno acted bossy.</p>

<p>“I rank higher than you. So I will be using you like dirt from now on.”</p>

<p>Yoh ignored him and entered the locker room. He changed his clothes quickly and left the locker room. He put on the sign which read “Cleaning on progress” and entered the pool area. There was no sight of No.29 today as well. Her name hadn’t been ticked on the cleaning check either.</p>

<p>Yoh started mopping the pool side by himself again today. He was covered in sweats in no time.</p>
<p>“Yo. Looks like you are working hard today as well.”</p>

<p>Combatant Z, who was in fact Tonno, appeared to make fun of Yoh. He was holding onto an ice bar.</p>

<p>“Hey. The poolside got dirty.”</p>

<p>From the entrance to where Tonno stood there was a black foot prints. He came to the pool side without taking his shoes off. When Yoh cleaned the floor with the deck brush—</p>

<p>“Hey, it’s dirty over here too.”</p>

<p>He stood on the clean area with his shoes on again. Yoh used the deck brush to wipe the floor and there was a dull sound.</p>

<p>The ice bar had fallen.</p>

<p>“Oops. I dropped it.”</p>

<p>He put on a forceful smile and then stepped on the ice bar.</p>

<p>“If you don’t clean it properly then you would get in trouble~.”</p>

<p>He started laughing after he said that. Yoh ignored him and started using the deck brush to mop the floor. He then threw the ice bar into the bin.</p>

<p>When he realized it, Tonno was already gone. It seemed like he left because Yoh didn’t respond.</p>

<p>Yoh looked at his watch. There was still time till it is 4 o’clock. When he left the pool area while taking the sign board with him he went into the recreation room. He heard a flashy sound of a dart.</p>

<p>(Someone is here already?)</p>

<p>When Yoh checked the cleaning check sheet he saw a tick on it. No.29 must had cleaned it. Yoh put away the cleaning tools and rushed into the underground passage.</p>

<p>The underground factory was located away from the residential section. He went through the passage and passed through the residential area which had the rooms for each combatants. He walked through a swirly path which was prepared in case the Saint Agents were to intrude. He then reached the underground factory.</p>

<p>The bright LED lights lit the factory. There were four rows of workbenches. There were three combatants standing straight from the side of the workbenches who carried a bamboo sword in their hand. It seemed like Combatant X, Y, and Z (Tonno) were the supervisor here.</p>

<p>(Ugh. The worst supervisor I could ask for.)</p>

<p>Yoh and others sat down in the order of their number. The one standing to the right of Yoh was No.27 who had a big breast. To his left was No.29 who had an enormous breast.</p>

<p>When all of them sat Combatant X said with a loud voice that today they would be building a new product today.</p>

<p>It was an item called the restraint-ball. An item which would restraint a person’s hands if you throw the ball at them and it hits.</p>

<p>“Look here. And watch carefully!”</p>

<p>When Combatant X shouted Combatant Y was standing several meters away as if they were had been planning it. Combatant X threw the restraint-ball at Combatant Y. The moment the ball hit him Combatant Y had his hand restrained and was hanging from the ceiling. Wow… The people who witnessed this were in commotion.</p>

<p>“As all of you know the weakness of the Saint Agents are their breast. If you grope their breast hard enough when they are restrained like this then even you guys would be able to defeat them.”</p>

<p>For that reason they wanted the service-staffs to build them.</p>

<p>The combatants went back to their position and instead a screen came down front of the workbenches. Then there was a video on the screen which showed how to build the restraint-ball.</p>

<p>After 30 minutes of watching the video the service-staffs proceeded to build them. They looked at dozens of parts and they put it in order of the ones that would be used first. They then started to put them together.</p>

<p>The three combatants were walking between the four workbenches. Then Yoh realized that Combatant Z, Tonno, was standing diagonally away from No.29. It seemed like he was having fun staring at No.29’s breast from his angle.</p>

<p>Yoh made one quickly and put it inside the basket which had the word “completed” on it. Tonno snored and checked the completed item. He walked towards a doll and threw the ball at it. The restraint ball restrained the doll’s arms and hanged it from the ceiling soon as it hit it.</p>

<p>“Complete.”</p>

<p>He said it with a bored voice.</p>

<p>Yoh put the second ball inside the basket. He looked at No.29 when he completed the third ball. She was struggling at the last phase of building it. She struggled in the part where you had to put the cover of the restraint-ball together. The cover was made from two semi-sphere covers but it seemed like she wasn’t able to fit them together.</p>

<p>“Who is still here who hadn’t made a single ball yet!? Those who are taking long should know that they would be tasting our bamboo sword!”</p>

<p>Tonno approached them again. He started to look into each of the basket which had the word “completed” on it. On Yoh’s basket there was two tags with the word “checked”. There was nothing on No.29’s.</p>

<p>No.29 turned towards the combatants supervising them. She was a bit agitated.</p>

<p>“You still haven’t made one yet!”</p>

<p>There was a shout from behind them. There was a sound of the bamboo sword being swung followed by the cries of a female service-staffs. No.29’s body twitched.</p>

<p>“Who else hadn’t completed one yet?”</p>

<p>Combatant X was approaching them slowly. Next to Yoh was No.29 who was feeling agitated and was trying to put the covers by force.</p>

<p>(That’s wrong. If you do it like that then it will break.)</p>

<p>“Whose going to be the victim of my bamboo sword next? Or do you prefer to have your breast groped by me instead?”</p>

<p>Ton’s voice was getting closer. At this rate No.29 would get her breast groped by him. No.29 put the parts back on her workbench. She tried to put the cover together by putting her weight on it.</p>

<p>Yoh kept quiet and put his completed restraint-ball in front of her.</p>

<p>No.29 paused for a moment.</p>

<p>“Hurry.”</p>

<p>Yoh whispered to No.29 while facing forward.</p>

<p>“Put it inside the basket.”</p>

<p>Yoh snatched the incomplete restraint-ball from No.29’s bench. No.29 realized what he was intending so she put the restraint-ball that Yoh put in front of her into her basket in a rush. Tonno appeared just then. He grabbed the restraint-ball and threw it at the doll. The restraint-ball activated properly and it made the dill hang from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Complete.”</p>

<p>Tonno said it in a bored tone and moved to the bench next to Yoh. Next to Yoh was No.29 who made a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Yoh dissembled the restraint-ball he took from No.29.</p>

<p>After looking at it carefully he realized how bad it had been assembled. The wires and the folding parts were placed in strange locations. Because of that it took extra space and didn’t fit properly.</p>
<p>“I cleaned the pool already.”</p>

<p>Yoh said that as he dissembled it.</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>No.29 gave a dry response. No.29 proceeded to build the second restraint-ball. When Yoh looked at No.29 while disassembling his he saw how rough her procedures were.</p>

<p>“You should build it with more delicate touch.”</p>

<p>“It’s not your business.”</p>
<p>“You will make a mistake again. Watch me carefully.”</p>

<p>When Yoh disassembled all of the parts he started to build them from the beginning.</p>

<p>“This is what you do first.”</p>

<p>He build it from the first step as he said that. No.29 builds the first part just as Yoh showed.</p>

<p>“Next is this.”</p>

<p>No.29 obeyed him.</p>

<p>“Then you have to fold this wire like this.”</p>

<p>No.29 folded it randomly.</p>

<p>“Wrong. Like this.”</p>

<p>Yoh taught her how to put the wire in once again. Then he taught her the next step. Then the next step.</p>

<p>“There isn’t much space in the ball so you need to fold the wires properly or else you won’t be able to put the cover over it.”</p>

<p>He continued to build the ball as he said that.</p>

<p>At the final phase he put the two semi-sphere parts. This time No.29’s restraint-ball’s cover fitted properly.</p>

<p>There was a sound of a click. No.29 blinked her eyes. It seemed as though she found it weird how she was able to make it this time.</p>

<p>When she placed the ball inside the basket Combatant X came to her place and tested her restraint ball. The doll had its arms restrained and was hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Completed.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>It was around 8pm when they were released from the underground basement. Yoh’s stomach was making noises due to hunger. The combatants would be eating their dinner which had been made by the chefs in their room right about now. The service-staffs would be eating their homemade food at the waiting room.</p>

<p>(Ah, I forgot to bring my food.)</p>
<p>He didn’t even buy a quick food from the convenient store either. The dinner time at the funded-students dorm would be between 6pm to 8pm. Today he might have to endure hunger.</p>

<p>No.29 was walking ahead of Yoh. They were pairs but it didn’t mean they got along. Yoh joined a week ago. She also joined a week ago. She showed sign of hating the service-staffs duties. Being a service-staff meant that she has her own reason to be here.</p>

<p>Soon as they returned to the waiting room there was a sound of the buzzer.</p>

<p>“Balanka-sama wants a Colombia beans coffee. No.28 and No.29 needs to bring it. If others brings it then we will beat you to death.”</p>

<p>The call from the interphone ended violently. Yoh and No.29 who had arrived in the room before him looked at each other’s face.</p>

<p>It was normal to receive such orders. But a specific member really gets asked to do it.</p>

<p>And the person who ordered it was also the problem. Balanka— the dark knight who was making his advances on No.29 yesterday. That giant man had quite the thing for No.29.</p>

<p>(Or—is this his revenge against me?)</p>

<p>Yoh grinded the Colombia beans at the edge of the waiting area. He then blended the Colombia beans by a hand drip. This was quite common for him when his family had a shop.</p>

<p>His family ran a cafeteria where they hand dripped to blend the coffees. Yoh often did his homework behind the counters. Obviously he blended coffees as well. He wasn’t as good as his father but he enjoyed when he blended coffees very well.</p>

<p>(Though our business was doing well. I believed that charging one thousand yen for a genuine coffee using blue mountain beans was a wrong move. There was no way that there were many people living in the country side who knew what actual coffee should taste like. For those living in the country side they probably had preferred a coffee which would be cheap and taste just above average. For people like that a coffee which costs one thousand yen would be expensive. Since we were picky on what beans we were using the other coffees were expensive too. And due to dad’s morals there were no sub menu except for a cake. I guess that made the situation worse. A cafeteria where you can’t even have a meal… I guess that was the reason.)</p>

<p>“Becareful you two.”</p>

<p>Yoh’s senior said that to them.</p>

<p>Balanka was sitting on a black leathered sofa and he had two black haired beauty on his sides as he was gently fondling their breast. Near him was the fat Combatant Z— Tonno. It meant that Tonno belonged to Balanka-squad.</p>

<p>There was a Chinese tea set on the table. On the wall there was large paint of rose. Though it didn’t look good here. A bit away from the sofa was the dart board. And darts were located near it.</p>

<p>On the floor was a tiger’s skin. Each of the item were high valued items. But each of them gave a different kind of atmosphere so it made the room unnatural as a whole. You couldn’t call it an elegant room even if you tried to compliment it. It suited the owner of this room who had a rough attitude.</p>

<p>It seemed like the room for the squads had two rooms: the living room and the captain’s room. Soon as you opened the door it was a living room where there were a television, tables, and sofas. The place where the combatants that belonged to the squad relaxed in. The room on the other side of the other door was the captain’s room— a private room for the dark knight. Yoh didn’t know what was in the other room. But it couldn’t be the demon’s nest.</p>

<p>“No.28 here.”</p>

<p>“No.29 here.”</p>

<p>When they bowed their head.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you, No.29. You come here and make me drink my coffee.”</p>

<p>He asked for something insane. He was obviously looking at No.29 with a sexual desire.</p>

<p>“Please do it yourself.”</p>

<p>To No.29’s blunt words—</p>

<p>“And you call yourself a service-staff!”</p>
<p>Balanka stood up as he made loud noises.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you know service-staffs that act like a cunt isn’t able to complain even if I break their neck?”</p>

<p>“The neck you should be breaking is wrong. Why don’t you kill the Saint Agents?”</p>

<p>Balanka suddenly grabbed a dart and threw the art at them. It grazed Yoh’s ear and hit the door behind him.</p>

<p>(That was close…!)</p>

<p>No.29 lightly flicks her blonde hair with her finger.</p>

<p>“Can you beat the Saint Agents with that short temper of yours?”</p>

<p>“Shut up!”</p>

<p>Balanka shouted.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of taking care of you but I forget that! I will kill the both of you!”</p>

<p>(What!?)</p>

<p>Yoh looked at No.29.</p>

<p>No.29 looked at the opponent with a calm attitude like a royal or noble would. But Yoh couldn’t stand this. The one was acting arrogant was No.29. He could understand No.29 receiving punishment but he couldn’t stand it if both of them would be killed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything.”</p>

<p>When Yoh said that.</p>
<p>“Yesterday you said you had a problem with what I said.”</p>

<p>Yoh became quiet.</p>

<p>It seemed like he still remembered. He sure was the worst kind of boss you could ask for.</p>

<p>“I will hang both of you to death now.”</p>

<p>Balanka took a step forward. Yoh took a step back.</p>

<p>(I thought yesterday was the best day in my life. But everything was going to end today. I guess the whole boob groping thing yesterday was the final wish for him before his life ends.)</p>

<p>“Balanka-sama.”</p>

<p>Tonno whispered into his ears.</p>

<p>“Quiet. Don’t you even dare to stop me—”</p>

<p>“How about this? I believe for everything you need some kind of entertainment.”</p>

<p>Tonno said something to him. Balanka laughed with his nose.</p>

<p>“You sure are clever.”</p>

<p>“Belzeria-sama is quite picky at everything after all.”</p>

<p>Balanka smiled and ordered him to do it. Tonno grabbed the numb-balls and handed a ball each to Yoh and No.29. No.29 caught it beautifully but Yoh was about to drop it. It wasn’t a dummy ball but a real one. If he dropped it then the floor would be colored in rainbow color.</p>

<p>“Umm…this is?”</p>

<p>“Hit the dart target with that. One throw each. If both of you misses then I will hang both of you to death.”</p>

<p>“That’s insane!”</p>

<p>Yoh cried out.</p>

<p>Yoh had been missing all of the throws during the numb-ball practice. He couldn’t stand the fact that a single throw of the numb-ball would decide his fate.</p>

<p>“Then will you die now? I’m giving a chance to both of you who had acted rude to me.”</p>

<p>Balanka glared at them with murderous eyes.</p>

<p>(Ah.)</p>

<p>(It’s useless. Those eyes are saying that he won’t listen to anything. The same eyes as the people who had come to gather their debt. Tonno smiled as he laughed. But.)</p>

<p>“I won’t accept that order.”</p>

<p>No.29 responded back.</p>

<p>“Do you want die now then!!?”</p>

<p>Balanka stood up.</p>

<p>The two meter giant was so tall that his head would reach the ceiling. He wasn’t the size of a human. Every single muscle of his had buffed up and was rock solid. A dangerous body.</p>

<p>No.29 couldn’t withstand his intensity. Balanka’s eyes was filled with murderous intent.</p>

<p>“I don’t care either way. How about I kill the both of you by ripping your heads off from your torso? Or how about I pull out all your organs?”</p>

<p>No.29 bit her lips hard. She was feeling disgusted at such unfair orders.</p>

<p>“Then I just need to hit the target.”</p>

<p>No.29 glared back at him and took a step forward. She held the numb-ball tightly and looked straight at the target. The target was five meter away.</p>

<p>No.29 aimed for the target carefully and threw the numb-ball. The numb-ball made a curve and—</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>No.29 couldn’t help but scream. Yoh also made a sound.</p>

<p>The wall which was to the upper right of the dart board was painted in rainbow color. The color tainted the wall so much. No.29 didn’t miss a single throw yesterday. But the numb-ball No.29 threw missed to the upper right of the dart board.</p>

<p>“Look likes your death is drawing near.”</p>

<p>Balanka smiled and was enjoying this. No.29 became pale and begs him.</p>

<p>“Let me throw once more—”</p>

<p>“I said one throw each!”</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“I will kill you first!!”</p>

<p>“But killing someone for something like this isn’t something a leader would do.”</p>

<p>Balanka reached his arm to her.</p>

<p>(No.29 is going to be killed…!)</p>

<p>Yoh didn’t know why. He didn’t know how he was able to move so quickly. Yoh’s body moved in front of No.29 on its own.</p>

<p>“I will throw the ball next.”</p>
<p>Balanka’s hand stopped right in front of Yoh’s neck. If he hadn’t No.29 would definitely had her neck snapped and killed.</p>

<p>Balanka looked at Yoh.</p>

<p>Perhaps he found him cocky. Or perhaps he was checking his worth.</p>

<p>“If you miss then I will hang you first.”</p>

<p>Balanka sat once again. There was tension in the room.</p>

<p>(A danger left but another danger came. —No, it wasn’t different from before. Perhaps I might die together with No.29.)</p>

<p>(Why did I help No.29? Because I helped her before? Because she was my partner?)</p>

<p>He didn’t care either way.</p>

<p>What was left for Yoh right now was a single numb-ball. His life would depend on whether he misses or hits.</p>

<p>If it hits his life would continue. If it misses his life would end.</p>

<p>(Will I die?)</p>

<p>Yoh thought vaguely.</p>

<p>(Will the man called Yoh Nigorikawa die here? I knew I couldn’t advance to high school when dad had debts. But he was suddenly picked as a funded-student so he entered school and was introduced to a beautiful master. Did I have fortunate life over all? Or was it an unfortunate life? I don’t know.)</p>

<p>“Hurry and throw!”</p>

<p>Balanka raised his voice. It seemed like if he ignored him he would get killed before throwing it.</p>

<p>(Damn. Keep your mouth shut big guy.)</p>

<p>Yoh complained inside his head. His life depended on this after all.</p>

<p>Yoh held the numb-ball tightly and stepped forward. Tonno was putting on a smirk like usual. The moment Yoh saw his smirk he realized Tonno was the one who gave such ideas to Balanka.</p>

<p>(He must have told him to make us throw the numb-ball. He probably told him that I suck at throwing and would miss. And if both of us misses he would kill me but make No.29 beg for her life to touch her breast.)</p>

<p>(That guy was always good at thinking up of these kind of things. That was why he had that smirk.)</p>

<p>Next to Yoh was No.29 who had a very nervous look. She must think that he would miss.</p>

<p>(I might become a hero if I hit the target.)</p>

<p>But he started thinking unnecessary things.</p>

<p>(I also hit the target yesterday from 30 meters away. A mere 10 meters is nothing.)</p>

<p>Yoh made up his mind and threw the numb-ball. The ball a big curve and—</p>

<p>(W-Will I get this!?)</p>

<p>The moment he thought as such the ball suddenly descended. It lacked power.</p>

<p>(Crap~!”</p>

<p>The moment he froze the ball fell much before it reached the dart board.</p>

<p>(Gyaaaaah~~! I missed~~!!)</p>

<p>The word DEATH appeared in his mind.</p>

<p>(Death flag confirmed. Now both No.29 and myself will die.)</p>

<p>“What a pathetic bunch. Death penalty it is.”</p>

<p>Balanka stood up.</p>

<p>His giant body covered both their sights.</p>

<p>“Die, both of ya.”</p>

<p>His thick arm reached for Yoh.</p>

<p>(I’m going to die…!)</p>

<p>Yoh closed his eyes. But—for some reason he wasn’t strangled.</p>

<p>(Don’t tell me he’s planning to kill No.29 first?)</p>

<p>“Aah!”</p>
<p>Yoh opened his eyes at the combatant’s scream. Yoh saw Balanka opening his jaws wide. No.29 also gasped.</p>

<p>(What the…)</p>

<p>Yoh also looked that way and was speechless.</p>

<p>The numb-ball missed. The rainbow color was scattered there. But it tainted something no one suspected. —It painted something which was hiding there. Something which appeared like a dog appeared after being covered in rainbow paints.</p>

<p>“A spydog! It was on camouflage mode!!”</p>

<p>Before Balanka could act the spydog kicked open the door and ran.</p>

<p>“Chase it!!”</p>

<p>The combatants chased after it. So did Yoh and No.29. There were rainbow colored footprints within the passage of the secret base. The spydog’s footprints.</p>

<p>“You carry it as well!”</p>

<p>The combatant passed Yoh a numb-ball and chased after it. There was no sight of the spydog.</p>

<p>Yoh looked left and right as he carried the ball.</p>

<p>The moment he thought he heard a dog’s bark. What Yoh saw when he turned around was a front foot of the spydog.</p>

<p>The spydog was hiding nearby and came to attack Yoh.</p>

<p>The mask on Yoh’s face was torn. No.29 gasped a seeing Yoh’s face.</p>

<p>There was a flash.</p>

<p>“Dammit!”</p>

<p>Spydog turned around and ran. Yoh respinded quickly and threw the numb-ball. The ball went towards the spydog so fast like a lazor beam and—hit the spydog.</p>

<p>(I-It hit!?)</p>

<p>Parts threw from spydog and it landed on the floor. The combatants jumped on the spydog immediately.</p>

<p>Yoh approached the spydog which had been destroyed. The interior of the spydog was exposed and the exterior was damaged badly. It was like the terminator before it’s death (destruction).</p>

<p>“Well done, No.28!”</p>

<p>The combatant noticed Yoh and spoke to him.</p>

<p>“Did it scratch your face?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Ah, yes.”</p>

<p>“Get a new mask.”</p>

<p>The combatants pat Yoh on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“You are quite the guy. In a single hit. Maybe you should become a combatant?”</p>

<p>The combatant laughed.</p>

<p>“Hurry. Go and get a mask quickly. Your face is fully exposed.”</p>
<p>Yoh bowed towards them walked away.</p>

<p>He was still a bit excited. He was simply desperate. The spydog attacked him so Yoh was angry and threw the numb-ball by reflex which ended up hitting it.</p>

<p>“You…”</p>
<p>His eyes met with No.29’s. She had a very shocked face.</p>

<p>“I actually hit it.”</p>
<p>“Yoh Nigorikawa…”</p>

<p>Yoh froze.</p>

<p>(Did Tonno tell her?)</p>

<p>(No. I don’t think Tonno would reveal my identity to No.29)</p>

<p>“Why do you know me?”</p>

<p>“Because—”</p>

<p>She stopped after saying that much. Her blue-eyes were saying that she was trying to come up with some excuse. Yoh looked at her blue eyes and her blonde hair. And then her rocket-like breasts.</p>

<p>He then realized it.</p>

<p>He had seen the same thing several times in school already.</p>

<p>“Wait…Clarissa!?”</p>

<p>No.29 closed her lips and stared at Yoh.</p>

<p>“Are you?”</p>

<p>No.29 didn’t answer. Yoh felt like removing her butterfly glasses from her face.</p>

<p>“You are Clarissa, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Asking for someone’s identity is rude.”</p>

<p>No.29 ran to the waiting room as if she tried to ran away from Yoh. Yoh was convinced that it was her as he followed behind her. Her blue eyes and blonde hair. And her way of speech. And the biggest proof was her rocket-like breasts.</p>

<p>(But why is she here…?)</p>

<p>And there was a big breasted dark knight with glasses who was looking at the two of them in secret…</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>After receiving a light disinfection in the infirmary Yoh wore a new mask and returned to the underground passage. Balanka’s room was located near the leader exclusive entrance.</p>

<p>There were still several combatants and two dark knights at the location where the spydog was destroyed. It was Balanka and Aizenaha.</p>

<p>“Dammit! I will kill them!”</p>

<p>The one who talked big was Balanka.</p>

<p>When Yoh walked passed them Tonno looked at Yoh. He was wearing his goggles but he looked quite jealous.</p>

<p>Yoh walked through the underground passage and headed towards the waiting area. He could hear the commotion of his comrades getting louder.</p>

<p>When he entered the room.</p>

<p>“Oh! He’s back!”</p>

<p>“You did it, No.28!”</p>

<p>Yoh’s comrade jumped on Yoh as if he had did a homerun for his baseball team. They started patting Yoh’s head while screaming in joy.</p>
<p>“You are the quite the guy for someone so young!”</p>
<p>“You made an achievement. You will definitely get a reward.”</p>

<p>His comrades gave him heartwarming words.</p>

<p>“Here. You are the main host for today. Sit here.”</p>

<p>The most veteran of them all made Yoh sit on the best sofa. The female service-staff gave Yoh a tea right away.</p>

<p>“Keep it as a secret from the higher ups, okay? Though they should forgive you. You did take down the spydog with one hit after all. You will definitely get a big reward for this.”</p>

<p>They secretly gave Yoh a cookie which they usually give to the leaders. It had been a while since he last ate cookie.</p>

<p>Yoh looked around the room. There was no sight of No.29.</p>

<p>“Is No.28 here?”</p>

<p>The combatant showed up in the waiting area.</p>

<p>“Here is a reward.”</p>

<p>The combatant placed the reward in Yoh’s hand and left. The service-staffs became quiet. They looked at his reward together.</p>

<p>What was within Yoh’s palm was a pack of gum where four out of seven of them was missing.</p>

<p>“Are those guys fucking with us!?”</p>

<p>The veteran No.2 shouted.</p>

<p>“Just three gums for taking down a spydog!? Are they looking down on the service-staffs!?”</p>

<p>“Balanka, that stingy bastard! What do they think of us!!?”</p>

<p>Yoh’s comrade shouted in anger. It became a big commotion. Some of them left the waiting room. They must have went to Balanka to complain directly at him.</p>

<p>“Share this with everyone.”</p>

<p>Yoh left the gums on the table and left the room.</p>

<p>(I was truly disappointed. It was a custom for a leader to reward a service-staff who made an achievement. But what was given to me was a pack of his leftover gums… It’s not even worth the same as a toddler’s pocket money. I would have died if I didn’t find the spydog so I might have been lucky. But I feel so disappointed.)</p>

<p>The service-staff were ranked the lowest within the Demonia PPO. From the leaders eyes they probably were just a grunt.</p>

<p>Yoh looked at his watch. His duty for today was over.</p>

<p>(Clarissa didn’t reveal her identity at the end.)</p>

<p>He couldn’t find her in the waiting room.</p>

<p>(Perhaps she didn’t want me to ask her questions.)</p>

<p>When he headed towards the locker room he saw a girl with an enormous breast leaning on the wall. The breast under her maid costume was sticking forward like a rocket.</p>

<p>She was No.29 also known as Clarissa. She hid her face with a butterfly glasses but there was no mistake about it.</p>

<p>“Looked like you received a wonderful reward.”</p>

<p>“The veteran service-staffs were all mad.”</p>

<p>“That was a fluke, wasn’t it? The numb-ball you missed tainted the spydog by luck and the numb-ball you threw took down the spydog by luck.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I used all my luck.”</p>

<p>“If you reveal my secret then you won’t be able to go to the academy anymore.”</p>

<p>“So you are Clarissa.”</p>

<p>Clarissa became quiet. There was no need for a threat if it wasn’t her. Threating him meant that it was her.</p>

<p>“Watch out for Tonno.”</p>

<p>“Tonno?”</p>

<p>“Combatant Z. That guy is our classmate. You won’t know what he will do to you if he finds out. He would walk in the pool room with his shoes on or drop an ice-cream on purpose.”</p>

<p>“Is that what he did to you?”</p>

<p>Yoh smiled. Clarissa twitched her eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Are you supposed to smile about that?”</p>

<p>“I mean he acts so childish.”</p>
<p>Clarissa took a good look at Yoh. It looked like she was trying to read him.</p>

<p>“Why are you in a place like this being a service-staff?”</p>

<p>“Because they took over my debt.”</p>

<p>“Then there was no need for you to become a funded-student.”</p>

<p>“It was right after my dad disappeared.”</p>

<p>Clarissa became quiet.</p>

<p>“Why is a special-student being a service-staff?”</p>

<p>“I believe that is none of your business.”</p>

<p>“If you keep on opposing Balanka like that you will be killed the next time.”</p>
<p>“That barbaric man is the worst.”</p>

<p>“I also think he is the worst but he’s someone you should avoid. If you want to pick a fight then do it with someone with more proper.”</p>

<p>“You would be hated if you start lecturing a woman.”</p>

<p>“If I don’t lecture you then you will be killed. We will get killed the next time you anger him.”</p>

<p>Clarissa didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“Anyways, I’ll be leaving.”</p>

<p>When Yoh tried to walk past her—</p>

<p>“Wait.”</p>

<p>Clarissa stopped him. She stared at Yoh.</p>

<p>“Close your eyes.”</p>

<p>She suddenly gave him an order.</p>

<p>(Close my eyes? Wait, will she kiss me?)</p>

<p>He thought of something which was unlikely.</p>
<p>“Hurry.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“Just do it quickly. Are you not a funded-student?”</p>

<p>Yoh gave up and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>There was no such thing as a special-student or funded-student in the evil organization. But Yoh thought that the highborns must be picky at this sort of things. He didn’t know what she would give him but it didn’t seem like she would slap him.</p>

<p>When he thought as such.</p>

<p>He suddenly smelled a perfume. When he thought that her arm was around his back two wonderful rocket-like breast was touching his chest. Her soft body was touching his.</p>

<p>Yoh opened his eyes in shock.</p>

<p>Something unreal was happening. Clarissa hugged Yoh. Sharp cannons were poking Yoh’s chest.</p>

<p>(Woah…! H-Her boobs…!!)</p>

<p>He was about to dance in joy.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful sensation which made him feel like his body will melt. Two healthy breast was poking his chest so much as if it was proving its great existence. It was a mass with incredible elasticity and shape. He could clearly tell her two rocket-like breast was touching him.</p>

<p>(T-They feel so good…!)</p>

<p>It felt like his blood was all flowing to his head.</p>

<p>(What is her size?)</p>

<p>(I can’t tell because my heart is beating too fast. But I am sure it is enormous. It might be bigger than Rina Akimoto.)</p>

<p>“This is my gratitude to you for helping me with the restraint-bomb.”</p>

<p>She muttered and put more strength in her arms. Her breast which feels like it would explode was bouncing on Yoh’s chest. When she hugged him strongly her breast did the opposite by pushing back Yoh with the same force. It was an amazing breast force.</p>

<p>(I’m going to get a boner…)</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>After putting her breast on him for the last time Clarissa walked towards the women’s changing room.</p>
