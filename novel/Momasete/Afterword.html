<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, I&#8217;ve only been novelising games for which I&#8217;ve written the scenario, but this is finally my first original erotic novel in five years. It seems that the term [juvenile pornography] is used in the world, but I don&#8217;t like this terminology.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to men, the heart of Akiba-kei culture is the &#8216;bishojo&#8217; (beautiful girl). Or, to put it another way, Akiba-kei two-dimensional heroines. Bishojo&#8221; = &#8220;Akiba-kei two-dimensional heroines&#8221; are two-dimensional heroines who are romantic and sexual objects for adolescent males.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was in the early nineties that &#8216;bishojo&#8217; = &#8216;Akiba-kei two-dimensional heroines&#8217; became a genre in the world of fiction. Juvenile is a term that was used before entertainment with &#8216;bishojo&#8217; as the main product was established, in other words, before the birth of bishojo. There, the sexual phase of bishojo has been stripped away. It is an anachronistic term that is totally inappropriate for today&#8217;s world, where bishojo has become the axis of entertainment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my mind, erotic novels are more appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In English, it would be HENTAI NOVEL right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, let&#8217;s talk about the story behind the creation of this work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For several years, I had been thinking about whether I could write a pornography with the story of a righteous ally and an evil organisation. I thought that a confrontation between justice and evil would be very old-fashioned philosophically, but very appealing from a pornographic point of view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, around June 2011, I received an email from Editor K asking me if I had any good porno manuscripts  to which I replied that I had something like this. The original idea was lost, but then I spoke&#8230;&#8230;over the phone and this is what I came up with. What if we did a novel version of 『Kyonyuu Fantasy』, but set in the present day, with a justice vs. evil structure?　That was the start. At first, the heroines were code-named Busty Red, Busty Pink and Busty Blue, but the name was changed because the editors thought it didn&#8217;t fit the current era. I would like to thank the editors, Mr M and Mr K.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">TL: I FUKING KNEW IT. I recognise the similarities. If you guys don&#8217;t know..『Kyonyuu Fantasy』is an erotic game. In which, ALL THE HEROINE ARE BIG TITS!! And the MC has S+ luck and his hands are ‘special’. If you have played it..you must know how similar this story and Kyonyuu Fantasy is. The Mc’s luck,perversion and once again..all the heroines have big tits. </span></p>
