<h3>Chapter 9: False Imprisonment</h3>

p><span style="font-weight: 400">１</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the kitchen of the waiting area, Clarissa was brewing coffee. It was to be taken to the combatants of Aizenaha Corps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And of course, for Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s battle had been somewhat anticlimactic. After it was over, the combatants gathered around and were strangely buzzing. It was a strange atmosphere with Baranka rushing over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《What the hell is this!》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《It&#8217;s a trap, of course. Are you stupid?》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《You~~!》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa wondered what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She thought it was just the usual altercation,but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s in trouble!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three cups of coffee had just been poured into three people&#8217;s cups when Service Officer 12 jumped in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beta&#8217;s been set up! They&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s a betrayal!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">２</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the dark knights had gathered in the conference room. The chairmanship was occupied by Belzeria.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among them, Yoh stood. He had been summoned under suspicion of betrayal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On either side, two strong combatants are grabbing Yoh by the arms to prevent him from escaping. Scurrying cockroaches could be seen crawling in the corners of the room.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How did this happen?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn’t remember buying one at all. First of all, smartphones are too expensive for him to have. He can&#8217;t afford to pay 5,000 yen every month for a default communication bill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark knights looked at the text messages on the monitor. It was a communication with Yoh, left on the smartphone that White Glass had dropped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the smartphone, Yoh was registered as combatant Beta.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other party is White Glass.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《I hold Eisenach out of obligation. Now I have to embrace Infinia too.》</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《Pink Police intends to take advantage of the opportunity to set herself free》</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A disturbing email was left behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh never hold these women out of obligation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha was the first woman that Yoh had ever experienced. Whenever he has sex with her, he gets an erection as hard as a metal and ejaculates as hard as he can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the content of the email was the exact opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《Dear Combatant Beta. Today is my first sortie. You should stay out of today’s battle. Okay,Okay, I&#8217;ll ask Rose and Blue to go easy on Infinia so she doesn&#8217;t get demoted.》</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the day of Infinia&#8217;s success, Yoh received an text message, informing him that White Glass will take it easy on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Yoh doesn&#8217;t recall receiving any such communication. In the first place, Yoh doesn&#8217;t have a smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last text message suggested Yoh’s betrayal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《The Two agents are waiting for you. It means it&#8217;s perfectly all right for them to be your lover. Please hold them both as soon as possible.Your righteous work needs to be rewarded.》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark knights were buzzing. Occasionally, some of them turned towards Yoh.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Damn it&#8230;&#8230;What the hell are you suspecting me of&#8230;.!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh looked at the dark knight with the utmost irritation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could they not understand?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could he betray them?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh is content with his life as a combatant. Firstly, who would bother to register and send an email to Combatant Beta?</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is clear what the intentions are, they wanted to frame Yoh for betrayal. They want to get rid of him and reduce the strength of Aizenaha and Infinia. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So why can&#8217;t they see through such a simple trap?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to hear your views.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Execution!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka was the first to shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew he was going to make a mistake one day. Incidentally, he&#8217;s risen too quickly. I knew there was something going on. You guys thought so too, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looks around at them all.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Execution is the best way. If he&#8217;s dead, he won&#8217;t betray us any more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t let you decide to execute him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha bites it straight on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka looks at her in disgust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t you read the email too? It said that having sex with you was an obligation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a lie!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha turns red.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poor you. It can&#8217;t be helped if you&#8217;re being played by a younger man. And you&#8217;re still a Dark Knight, eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t get too upset because you&#8217;re losing a lover. If you cover for him too much, it&#8217;ll come back to haunt you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beta is innocent!　If he was trying to betray us, I would have been the first to know!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess you felt so good that you didn&#8217;t realise it. You’re a technician, you know. It seems you were getting fucked so hard you passed out, weren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha stood up and reached for the whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, are you going to do it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aizenaha” </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia grabbed Aizenaha&#8217;s arm to control her. It seems that the normally calm Aizenaha is apparently too invested in the situation and her blood is rising in her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll take care of the Pink Police. This is what happens when you leave it in the hands of humans. I&#8217;m going to torture the Pink Police. No one will complain!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka glared at Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Infinia who answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, isn’t it the failure Infinia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Failure is superfluous.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You shouldn&#8217;t cover for him. You&#8217;ll be the one who will be dragged down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia did not respond to Baranka’s humour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have my doubts about this. Would someone who seems to have been in cahoots with an agent take down a fellow agent?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why it was a smart move. Once he takes down Pink Police, we’ll know that he is on our side.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka smirks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the contrary, I think it’s ridiculous and you&#8217;re stupid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Beta is the inside man, why did he send in the Spydogs?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To make us think there&#8217;s no traitors amongst us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why divulge it today? Nobody knew about it, remember? They let their inside man beckon them to break into our base. If four people hit it, they can destroy our base but why didn&#8217;t they do that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s &#8230;..isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka clamped up once. Then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think an agent will call out to a guy who doesn&#8217;t know anything? White Glass and Beta know each other. His words on this smartphone or whatever it&#8217;s called are proof!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia looked coldly at Baranka, who was determined blaming Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re an idiot.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the shadow of the white glass—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when Infinia was about to call it a conspiracy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria interrupted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve discussed most of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Belzeria-sama,I’m not done yet!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Belzeria-sama! At least give him the chance to explain himself──”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is not needed”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria silenced Aizenaha and Infinia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no need to fight at each other if there is doubt. Suspend his status as a combatant and lock Beta up in a room reserved for slaves.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">３</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is too unreasonable&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh thought as he walked. Although his hands and feet are not restrained, he is treated like a prisoner in this situation. He wasn&#8217;t even given a chance to explain himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was shocked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia told him that Berzelia had said that he was the base&#8217;s treasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet──.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’m treated like a prisoner for just this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was disappointed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh expected the number two of the base and could through it but Belzeria couldn&#8217;t even see through the conspiracy of White Glass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is all too stupid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The service bureau members were out in the aisles. Former seniors are looking at him with concern. Clarissa is also there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh rummaged in his pockets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only one restraining ball remained.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Should I use this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It occurred to him but</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he uses it now, he&#8217;ll be even more suspicious. Currently, everyone knows he is on the side of the agent and if he got away..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh have no choice but to endure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh went down the stairs. He walked to the basement floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He went further down to the second basement floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A heavy feeling came over him. How could he be imprisoned in a room reserved for slaves? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">４</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am not convinced!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When all the dark knights left the room, Aizenaha screamed at Belzeria.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beta would never have betrayed us! You know how useful he&#8217;s been to the base! Even the other day, he took a zero-gravity bullet for his comrades and alerted everyone from above of the danger! Why can&#8217;t you understand that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria did not answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She remained silent and looked at the floor. A cockroach scurried around out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With all due respect, I think he&#8217;s innocent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia, the other remaining woman, adds on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was White Glass’s──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria quickly blocked Infinia&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He is imprisoned. He is forbidden to have any contact with you or to take part in any battles. He will be severely punished shortly. Prepare for execution.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Belzeria-sama!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha raises a plaintive cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, Belzeria-sama! Execution is not an option!　Please, please…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha chases after her with a voice that sounds like it is about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Berzelia did not answer. Infinia joined her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I beg of you,Belzeria-sama. I beg you, please withdraw your decision!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t withdraw.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she answered, Belzeria increased her speed. As if she is chasing something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were cockroaches on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cockroaches crawling on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria jumped lightly &#8211; and a banging, dull sound echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha and Infinia stopped in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People are pleading with her, and she is chasing cockroaches? They must have thought so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria rubbed her feet on the floor some more. Persistently stomping and crushing. Then she lifted her foot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cockroach was flattened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An ugly liquid spread out. There was something strange mixed in with that liquid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Electronic components.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Belzeria-sama──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria put her index finger to her mouth. Aizenaha and Infinia fell silent. They realised what Belzeria was after.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of them looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Belzeria-sama──, that was…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They really do love their spy robots, don&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what was the meeting about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Infinia&#8217;s words, Belzeria nodded. Aizenaha gasped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Belzeria-sama, did you do it on purpose…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let them think we&#8217;re going to execute Beta. There will definitely be movement from them..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Barranca──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">５</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina sighed as she entered the private waiting room as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other day it was a private pool, but today it was a room reserved for slaves. The only people allowed in were the slaves and the slave captor &#8211; Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh&#8217;s instruction was gym clothes with no bra. He probably wanted to pretend to be in PE class and touch her boobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s a bit late than usual] Rina thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He usually comes as soon as the battle is over but he doesn&#8217;t come very often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina wonders if Aizenaha is holding him captive.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if he doesn&#8217;t care about me any more…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head for having such thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t matter if Yoh doesn&#8217;t care about her anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if he stops, she will belong to another dark knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh&#8217;s words came back to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is supposed to hate him but she&#8217;ll miss him if he doesn&#8217;t come.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did he get angry because of what I said at school yesterday? Is he going to not come today?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door was open.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If he&#8217;s not coming, maybe I should leave&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a combatant who entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, Yoh was behind him. He was flanked by two combatants. What&#8217;s going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H, hey&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh smiled wryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not listening to you tod──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina was about to say it when she lost her words. A large shadow had appeared from behind Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!? Surprised…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of the dialogue, Yoh was thrown on the floor, his face hitting the ground with a dull thud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shadow chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka &#8211; the worst dark knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noaaaah&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina instinctively fled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is going to be raped and treated badly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina has never heard a good word about Baranka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s no use running away from me. You&#8217;re going to be raped by me today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Help! Nigorikawa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Involuntarily, Rina  called his last name for the first time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh&#8217;s hand moved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He probed his pockets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, don&#8217;t let him go free.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Baranka&#8217;s words, the lead combatant stomps on Yoh&#8217;s limbs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lukewarm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The combatant kicked him further in the side. Yoh moaned and held his stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fear ran through Rina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no one here to help her anymore. Not even Yoh would help her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina grabbed the cushions with a frenzy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three, four.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Throw them all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Baranka does not take any damage and approaches her with an obscene smile on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heheheh, it&#8217;s nice to have a woman who resists.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina retreats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She fled from one corner of the room to another. But Barranca was agile. Soon, he cornered Rina in a corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Help me~~~!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one will hear you. It&#8217;s the kind of room that it&#8217;s meant to be in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stretched out his burly, hairy arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina quickly fled to the right. But when she took three steps, Baranka blocked her way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Demon!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina tried to kick him but her leg was caught.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noooooooo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She struggled but was pushed against the sofa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, heh, heh, I heard of it. I heard you&#8217;re an idol. You have a better style than the rest of us. And above all, I like your big breasts.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nononononono!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina hit Baranka as hard as she could. After hitting it four times, both of her arms were grabbed by one hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at Yoh, but Yoh still remained on the floor/</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehehe. I&#8217;m going to show him. He can watch you getting fucked by me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka took off his trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A big penis appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina was shocked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s nearly thirty centimetres long.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If he put something like that in me, I&#8217;ll&#8230;&#8230;die&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina writhed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her hips and tried desperately to escape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was nothing she could do, as if she were being held down by a machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka tore her bloomers, panties and all. At that moment.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaa&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m going to be raped&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despair permeated his brain. Slowly the blood drained away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina is going to be raped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By this monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To a non-human being.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry, until now.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I will no longer be me&#8230;&#8230;.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to have given up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka opened Rina&#8217;s legs. The crack opens up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina finally gave up her resistance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What can resistance do? It will only give Baranka the pleasure of conquest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka puts one of her hand on his penis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A big smile appears on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a nice pussy you got there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He advances his hips. The tip comes close to the crack. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s when, unexpectedly &#8211; a cuss word was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can you make her cum with such a limp dick?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka peels his eyes away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked at the owner of the voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While being trampled by the combatants, Yoh is smiling wickedly at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The fuck you say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re deaf, you limp dick. You&#8217;ll be ejaculating in a second anyway. You&#8217;re a hundred years too young to fuck my idol.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka stood up with his penis exposed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s you! who wants to get yourself killed, you wooden cunt! Come at me, you little prick.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Baranka peeled his eyes out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An angry spirit filled the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You! I&#8217;m going to kill you&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, dance like a pig and stab like a pig?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, human! You&#8217;re a hundred years too old to be a combatant!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka flew through the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The huge body arcs and with the acceleration of gravity on its side, it swoops down at a high speed.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He&#8217;s going to die&#8230;&#8230;.!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning to his knees, Baranka descended on Yoh&#8217;s neck. Yō&#8217;s hand, which had been holding his stomach, shot out to the side of his body and threw something at Baranka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But her screams were overlaid by the sound of screaming and strange machinery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was lying face down on his stomach. Baranka, who should have scored a knee drop on his neck, was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He’s gone&#8230;&#8230;!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He  did not disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it! What the hell is this! Ow! Put me down, damn it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina looked up at the sound of a voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suspended on the ceiling was Baranka. A restraining ball &#8211; a weapon of the Demonia Salvation Planet. The restraining ball had suspended Baranka.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Could it be that Yoh was searching his pockets for the restraining ball? Was his arm flung out at his side to throw the restraining ball?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He threw a restraining ball at the descending Baranka. So, before it could hit him, Baranka was suspended from the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The combatant, startled, backed away from Yoh. Yoh slowly stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, beta, I&#8217;ll kill you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to kill you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then both of them shouted at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re dead! You colluded with the agents! You’re the traitor!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not a traitor!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you&#8217;re a coward!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka&#8217;s nostrils widened. He gritted his teeth in frustration and said</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me the girl!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Absolutely not!!! I won&#8217;t give Rina to anyone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yoh~~!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka went wild but he couldn’t move from his spot. On the contrary, he was screaming as his penis was pulled in the opposite direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina&#8217;s chest choked as she tried to answer. Emotions surged at once and she shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re going to help me, you should have helped me sooner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, idiot, idiot&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina hugged Yoh. As soon as she hugged him, she burst into tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s alright. Don&#8217;t be frightened anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh stroked her back. Rina pressed her body against him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina was scared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She really thought she was going to be raped. She thought she was going to die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Yo helped her&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He protected her. She recalled the incident with Butano. When he tried to secretly take a picture with his mobile phone, Yoh throw a ball in his way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even then &#8211; Yoh protected her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《You&#8217;re the worst kind of man, aren&#8217;t you? Just because you beat me&#8230;》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《If you don&#8217;t do it, you&#8217;ll belong to another dark knight.》”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaaa…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s how it was. Yoh had been trying to protect her all along.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina shook her head sideways at Yoh&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have something to tell you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pregnancy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yesterday, White Glass came to my house.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rina-chan&#8217;s house?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He asked me to tell the real name of Combatant Beta. I figured he was going to do something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh became quite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have been familiar to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, let&#8217;s get out of here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That won&#8217;t be necessary.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina and Yoh turned at the sudden sound of a female voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the head of the group was Belzeria. Rina had only met her once. The number two of the 081 Base. The base&#8217;s strongest dark knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind her are Aizenaha and Infinia. Both of them were carrying strange sprays. They run to the corner of the room and suddenly start spraying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No robots, Belzeria-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria nodded and looked up at Baranka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This, this..Belzeria-sama&#8230;..Beta, he suddenly rebelled and tried to let that woman escape…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka, who had been restrained to the ceiling, hurriedly made up an excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you saying that you were beaten back?　You&#8217;re a dark knight, you&#8217;re pathetic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria&#8217;s voice is cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I let my guard down…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you saying you let your guard down and exposed your cock?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You tried to take a prisoner for yourself and Beta fought back. You&#8217;re a disgrace to Demonia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria lightly taps the floor. At once, she soared to the ceiling where Baranka was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka was startled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My order was to lock Beta in the slave quarters. I did not tell you to rape the slaves either. You will learn with your body what happens if you disobey my orders.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, one of Belzeria&#8217;s hands disappeared. The next moment, a roar and a cloud of dust exploded into the room. It sounded like an explosion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka&#8217;s figure is obscured by a cloud of dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually when the smoke cleared. Baranka had plunged into the wall up to his waist and was motionless. With a swing of her arm, Belzeria had pinned the giant Baranka against the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No matter how monstrous you are, you&#8217;re useless. You must be prepared to never return to the main planet with a decent body”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">６</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above the residential area, the stars were shining.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh drove Rina home, even though she still had work to do. They cycled together in the moonlight. They hardly spoke to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When they parted, they only said goodnight to each other. At that time, she just wanted to escape to her own home and find safety, but when she turned on the lights in her room, she felt different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A photo of Yoh was floating in the fluorescent light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth, it was a picture she stuck up because she hated Yoh. She always thought she was going to beat this guy and while she practises ZUMBA, a few punches and kicks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But today, she didn&#8217;t feel any hate towards him. She felt as if he was waiting for her in her room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she looked out of the window, Yoh was gone. The only sound to be heard was the oily, metallic clatter of a rickety bicycle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina closed the window and turned to the photo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be time to stop putting them up for training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she was about to pull it off, Rina stopped.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s leave the photo on&#8230;&#8230;.Until next time I can get a proper photo&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">７</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only yesterday that Combatant Beta emailed White Glass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《Having risen through the ranks in the Demonia Salvation Planet, I found myself under suspicion. I was almost killed. I want you to shelter me. I no longer have any feelings for Demonia. I want to join the agents.》</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass also intercepted that Berzelia, the base&#8217;s number two, was contemplating execution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after that, the cockroach robot stopped contacting them. Perhaps it was mistakenly killed by another cockroach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No update has been received, but the contact was made the day after the execution sentence. Given Belzeria&#8217;s tone of voice, it is unlikely that the punishment will be withdrawn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When White Glassdeclared that he would meet with Combatant Beta, Rose Scola disagreed. She said it would be dangerous and should not be done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So are you coming with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola remained silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Personally, White Glass prefers Rose Scola but for her he is not suitable, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you get the smartphone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous posed the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think about uncertainties. That&#8217;s my rule.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if it&#8217;s a trap?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why I picked this spot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recalling his memories, White Glass looked up at the night sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A number of trailers run on the Metropolitan Expressway over the bank of the Arakawa River. The marker lamps on the sides make it look like a swarm of lights is running by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wind was strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His watch showed 10:20pm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one would come to the river bank of the Arakawa River at this time of day. Beyond the river  bank, the Ayase River, which flows adjacent to the Arakawa River, can be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Footsteps are approaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two people come running.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass put his hand on a pair of goggles that looked a lot like glasses. Two people come running &#8211; one in a black combat suit and one in a black maid&#8217;s outfit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the text message, Beta also wrote that he would be bringing a good friend of his from the service bureau and that he would like to be added to the group.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As per the declaration.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He emerges from behind a huge concrete pillar. This one, too, is not in human form, but as an agent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“White Glass?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beta?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other man nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A beta mark on his forehead &#8211; there was no mistaking it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me see your face.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you show it first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think justice can be shown?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beta put his hand on his mask. He seems to intend to comply meekly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Idiot. This is what your face is for.,,’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass placed his hand on his waist belt. He is going to take a picture of Beta&#8217;s face. Then, based on that, he&#8217;ll be able to identify.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mask was removed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass was stunned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What emerged was a man in Kumadori.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Kabuki make-up.]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why Kabuki?! How should I know what he looks like if he wears it!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, White Glass froze. And then the maid with the butterfly glasses next to him was waiting for this opportunity. A whip suddenly whipped and a powerful electric shock extended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time White Glass tried to react, it was too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was hit by the electric shock and flew through the air. He should have rolled towards the Arakawa River, but he flew into the neighbouring Ayase River.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the Ayase River is not a clean river.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said to have once been a habitat for fireflies, but the water quality has deteriorated to the extent that it was  recorded twice as the worst river in the 2000s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It rolled down the slope towards the Ayase River.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwwaaaaaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass tried to find a ground to land but fell with a vain and unpleasant thud. Dirty mud enveloped the pure white costume of the righteous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geeaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another electric shock flew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took a direct hit and this time jumped out of the Ayase River.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I’m going to be killed!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass panicked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of all people, to bring Aizenaha disguised as a maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As White Glass had been warned. Aizenaha and Combatant Beta had seen through that smartphone as a trap and decided to set up a revenge trap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass had also put a trap at the bank of the Arakawa River with this possibility in mind, but he didn&#8217;t think she would disguise herself as service members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha and Combatant Beta came across the bridge. They intend to finish him off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass tries to run away but his legs are numb.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If I get hit again, I&#8217;ll…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dull thud sounded and suddenly a smoke screen spread. A haze of smoke billows up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What the hell&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While wandering around in the smoke, the figures of Rose Scola and Blue Gorgeous jumped into view. They had come to rescue him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank God&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Come on, before you get caug──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were about to say [caught] but then they quickly moved away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They noticed the dirty mud on him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I did fall into the Ayase River a while ago.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Run away by yourself”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please help yourself”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They disappeared in a smoke screen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Da,damn it~!　We&#8217;re on the same side of justice, but you just left me to die!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he screamed, no help would come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass soared into the sky. He jumped over the Metropolitan Expressway and rose even higher into the sky. The combatant and maid could be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Go back and attack them?’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as White Glass was contemplating his option, a lighting ran into him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Geeh! Lightning attack?!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took another direct hit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaa!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a scream, White Glass went straight down into the Arakawa. River. At 10:32pm, a grand splash was made into the Arakawa River.</span></p>
