<h3>Chapter 3: The Holy Mother Church</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina sighed as she returned to the slave-only private room on the second basement floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt it all over again&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It’s so frustrating..What&#8217;s wrong with me giving him a handjob?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other party is her sworn enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is the man who has turned her from a friend of justice into a slave for evil. And at school, he&#8217;s only a low-ranking classmate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, he always makes her cum. She used to be the Pink Police, fighting against an evil organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was she who had infiltrated the spydog into the 081st base. At that time, she found out that Yoh was a service officer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t tell her fellow agents. But before she could tell them, she was defeated and enslaved. Because of the strange drugs she was given immediately after her captivity, she was unable to reveal this secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was humiliating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh is a person who is not compatible with her. She should be matched with someone of a higher standard. She can&#8217;t believe that she&#8217;s been made into a sex friend of someone who has no future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──the sex feels good. Even though she doesn&#8217;t like it, she always clings to it&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">２</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blonde haired service member, No. 29 entered the women&#8217;s toilet, which is reserved for lower ranks. She walked in, rocking her rocket bust and stopped in front of the mirror.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took off her butterfly glasses and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who appeared was Clarissa &#8211; a Westerner with a high nose and blue eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the International Institute of Glovaria, she is at the top of the hierarchy. But in the Demonia Salvation Planet, she is the lowest-ranking member of the service bureau. She is often summoned by combatants, shouted at and forced to have physical relations with dark knights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She used to be paired with Yoh as a fellow service member.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Yoh, who had joined the same service bureau, quickly took credit and was promoted to a combatant. As for her…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She feels depressed when she thinks about it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why did I join such an organisation, even if it was to help my father? If I had been able to realistically imagine such a miserable situation awaiting me, I wouldn&#8217;t have joined&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After putting her butterfly glasses back on, Clarissa left the bathroom.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, an ill-dressed fat man wearing a white wrestler&#8217;s mask and fully clothed in white tights was seen emerging from the men&#8217;s toilet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Male Service Officer 48──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is also a student at Glovaria International Institute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until two weeks ago, he was a combatant and used to bully Yoh but was demoted to a service bureau member after he sneaked a punch at Yoh. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This fat pig still hasn’t a clue that Clarissa is a Service Member No. 29.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What an odd coincidence. I just got here myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one had asked him to speak to her, but Butano spoke to her on his own.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa ignored him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re still aiming to be a combatant, aren&#8217;t you?　I, too have the same objective.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is saying things that make her laugh quite a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m still in the good graces of Baranka. If you want to be a fighter, I&#8217;ll talk to him. In return.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano walked up to her and put his face close to hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me rub those tits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of replying, Clarissa tried to give him a slap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her arm was stopped by Butano and immediately twisted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m an ex-combatant. I&#8217;m not going to be slapped easily by you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano pressed his body against Clarissa. She could feel that his belly was pressed tightly against her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The worst.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m being touched by this guy&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve got really big breasts. They&#8217;re like rockets. Just like Clarissa’s.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa became horrified.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Have I been exposed?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No.’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, I haven&#8217;t been found out yet. But if I were to say something unintelligent──’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo&#8230;&#8230;no, I mean Beta. You seem to be going well with Beta, are you letting him touch you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano’s field arms extended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to twist around but I couldn&#8217;t move my arm. My arm starts to hurt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then his hand went around in front of my chest.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This cheeky bastard&#8230;..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a scream was heard.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not Clarissa&#8217;s voice. It wasn&#8217;t her own breasts that were grabbed, either. Someone had snuck up behind Butano, grabbed his head and threw him to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell are you doing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano shouted, and froze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two ogre-like horns protrude from her red hair. Wearing a black rider&#8217;s suit, similar to that of that squad, covers her uneven body. The flame emblem on her chest is valiant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Infinia, a dark knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hurry up and get into the waiting area.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A low voice commanded Clarissa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano was the first to move. He saw that he was at a disadvantage and tried to run into the waiting area.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, his footsteps stopped since Infinia had gone around in front of the waiting room door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is Infinia’s w</span><span style="font-weight: 400">eapon. Her speed allows her to approach the enemy and bring them into combat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A scream went up. Infinia&#8217;s kick had launched and Butano was slammed into the wall and was buried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How long are you going to feel like a combatant, you little shit!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The demon girl glares at Butano with a hatred voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something about me that you should know. I hate people who bullies other service members. If you try anything funny again, I&#8217;ll have you become like a mural again! Remember that!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spitting, Infinia walked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn that&#8230;&#8230; Oni woman&#8230;&#8230;what&#8217;s with the mural &#8230;&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano complains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He twisted his body, groaned and tried to get out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He can&#8217;t get out. His arms and legs are completely buried in the wall. It&#8217;s like he&#8217;s become a mural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se, seriously&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano became impatient.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He turns to Clarissa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have to help me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he struggles, a cockroach creeps out and start to crawl. With its antennae twitching, it approached Butano’s feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You idiot, don&#8217;t come, go away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano spat out.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cockroach stopped in its tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its antennae move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once there, the cockroach made a detouring gesture and suddenly went straight for Butano’s feet. It stops just before it hits the shoe and twitches its antennae again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go away, you idiot! If you come here, I&#8217;ll kill you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as he shouted, the cockroach ran up Butano&#8217;s legs at once. His screams echoed through the underground passage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">３</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Holy Mother Church &#8211; that was the name of the church.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It stands quietly amongst a forest of buildings. It is 11 storeys high. The church is located on the eighth floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">God created the world in six days and set the last day as a day of rest. What about the floors beyond that &#8211; from the eighth floor upwards &#8211; is it pretending to be God&#8217;s dwelling place?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the eighth floor was a cross and an altar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of it, two shadows descended. They were Saint Agents, the allies of justice against the Demonia Salvation Planet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s still hard for the two of us to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola sighed. Her shoulders are a little scorched, perhaps from Aizenaha&#8217;s shockwave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s nothing we can do about that woman wearing glasses. She never was that strong”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“yeah. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous agrees.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/11.png" alt="" width="526" height="746" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But we got what we came for. The spy robot seems to have successfully infiltrated.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the spy robot this time? A dog?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous stammered at Rose Scola&#8217;s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s something much&#8230;&#8230;smaller.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Can it film the footage?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola asks innocently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s just&#8230;..audio&#8230;&#8230;but it can get into all sorts of places&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Blue Gorgeous is sweating a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So when are you going to collect them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first group will be in tomorrow&#8230;—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">４</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Black sofas faced each other in the anteroom. Her subordinates were unmasked and mumbling. Through them, Infinia entered her own private room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black-and-white sofa with a panda painted on it awaited her. The walls also had pandas painted on them. As she sat down on the panda sofa, Infinia brushed her hair back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She still couldn&#8217;t believe that Aizenaha had released that shockwave. She was smart but she should not have been a knight who excelled in military prowess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of power alone, the destructive power of that shockwave is among the top three even at the base.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without thinking, there was only one answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the breast massager–combatant Beta&#8217;s fault.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three weeks ago, the boy was a bottom-of-the-barrel service officer. Then, the boy was discovered by Aizenaha and became a combatant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, Infinia underestimated him. She thought that he was selected because of his physical compatibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Do I have to find  a breast massager for myself?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia asked herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t have a breast-massager.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t want a man she doesn&#8217;t like to touch her breasts. She knows that her subordinates are admiring her breasts and she would not let anyone touch them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Infinia is in a situation where danger is looming on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her squadron has not been able to show good performance recently. Two weeks ago, they were hit by zero-gravity bombs and lost in an appalling manner. She is sure that the reputation of the base&#8217;s combat commander, Berzelia, has gone down as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has to do something about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she suffers another abject defeat, she may be demoted. </span></p>
