<h3>Chapter 4: Demotion</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the sound of the ringing bell, Yoh stretched his arm out from the duvet and grabbed the alarm clock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“5.45 am. Time to get up…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday was a good day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He got to suck a lot of Aizenaha&#8217;s boobs and taste Rina&#8217;s boobs. He even came as hard as he could with her titjob.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But today is his day off from work in Demonia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking off his pyjamas and neatly folding the duvet, Yoh left Room 101. He was met by a first-year student called Nitani in room 102 next door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both greeted each other briefly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Yoh, his parents went bankrupt and he was unable to go on to higher education to pay off his debts and he was saved by his current master. He is a dull-cheeked, shadowy man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You came home in the middle of the night the other day, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nitani said in a low voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The three-year seniors are saying that you’re making a problem. They say you’ve been out and about…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s quite a selfish thing to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good to be like that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you that I am working part-time at a construction site.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh lied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the canteen, they came across the second-year students. Yoh bowed his head. As they took their seats, the third-year students came in just before six o&#8217;clock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whereas the faces of the first-year students are generally gloomy, the third-year students are a little more innocent. They are probably more open to their own circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Curry and rice is brought in. Everyone joins hands and chants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you to all the special students, for another delicious meal today.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the words of thanks, it was breakfast time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them silently put their spoons in their mouths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not a very good, delicious curry. The rice is also of the lowest standard. They had a couple of bowls of cold rice but it was inedible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a little more than ten minutes, Yoh and the others took the tray and headed to the kitchen. Washing dishes is a first-year student&#8217;s job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing his morning work in silence, he made onigiri (rice balls). This is the lunchbox that serves as lunch. It is the job of the first-year students to make onigiri for the second and third-year students, including their own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After packing the onigiri into Tupperware, Yoh went back to his room. He puts his gym clothes in his handbag and puts on his uniform, which looks like a work uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s time to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He walked out the front door and jumped on his rickety bicycle. A total of eighteen of them were going to school in a group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, it&#8217;s creepy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He thinks it&#8217;s gross but he can&#8217;t help it. That&#8217;s the way it is for the monastic students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They arrived at Glovaria International Institute at 7.15 am. Yoh left his classmates in the corridor and entered the first-year bronze class classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was, of course, unoccupied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He started mopping, followed by wiping down all three seats, one seat and Clarissa&#8217;s desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh looked at his watch.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it time to pick her up?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He erased the blackboard and opened the door, only to be met by a girl who walked in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Rina Akimoto.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The breasts of her sailor uniform were vigorously protruding and the hem covering her stomach was floating up. Even in her uniform, she has a great volume of breast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Move aside.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina said in a cold voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you squeeze me, I&#8217;ll move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh say something nasty on purpose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, there were no other students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are the worst kind of man, aren&#8217;t you? Just because you beat me──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don&#8217;t do it, you&#8217;ll become the property of another Dark Knight.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re lying..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, you don&#8217;t have to believe me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina stared at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can&#8217;t you just give me a hug?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The idol sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She put her arms around Yoh’s back. A wonderful swelling touched Yoh&#8217;s chest. A youthful H-cup mountain pierce Yoh&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh couldn&#8217;t resist and hugged Rina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, if they see you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina raises her sweet, slightly nasal voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rina-chan&#8217;s boobs feel so good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pervert, I really hate you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I like you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hate you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh hugged Rina even tighter and shook her body. The wonderful breast tension tickled his breastplate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaan….people are really coming.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh let go of Rina. Then she rushed to the seat of the honours student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">２</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While attending the class, Rina looked at Yoh diagonally behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is dozing off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, he was on night duty. He was probably at the Demonia base until morning. She left at 11pm…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she think about Yoh, she feel depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wonders how long this will continue. She can&#8217;t believe that she hugs him not only at the base but also at school. </span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it sure felt a bit nice to have her breasts rubbed by Yoh. If it had been at the Demonia base, would he have begged for it again&#8230;..?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina shook her head.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s not think about that guy.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she wondered if her former friends would come again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola and Blue Gorgeous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn’t know their real names or who they are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably not much older than herself. They must attend school the same way as herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina looked around the class.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa was different. Neither of them had blonde hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither was Kyoichiro Shirai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were the same honours student and special student. She wears blue glasses and looks prideful. But there are no male members of the agency.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina stopped to look at St Lumina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quiet-looking girl with medium hair. But she has great breasts. They are as big as her own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Rina recalls, she came from the same junior high school as Yoh.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She does often look at Yoh, does she like him? A man like that?’</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s on the side of justice&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her breasts seem fit but the brave Rose Scola, who shoots zero-gravity bullets, cannot be St Lumina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina noticed that, Butano, who had a face like a pig, was secretly pointing his mobile phone at her. Probably he is filming a video.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This guy..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Butano raised his voice. His mobile phone was flying due to an object that suddenly swung from the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the teacher turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa..nothing..”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano hurriedly picked up his mobile phone. A ball was lying near him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A ball? The ball flew from behind. That means ──.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina looked at Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was doing a gut-pose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nigorikawa!! Was it you..!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh blurts out.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did he throw that&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For what?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It can’t be&#8230;..is it for me?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That boy is not that kind of man. He just wants my body for free.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ball flew from behind me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoichiro Shirai testified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano shouts at Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nigorikawa, did you throw that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I threw it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Clarissa&#8217;s words, both Butano and the teacher flinched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah&#8230;.., no, no way&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it my fault? I threw it because you’re trying to voyeur my classmate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Butano turns bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the teacher shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stand in the corridor!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Butano walked out of the classroom, Yoh turned to Clarissa and she winked at him.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That was a lie&#8230;&#8230;.!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina had a hunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, indeed it was Yoh who threw the ball.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">３</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At 7pm, two girls who are on the side of justice had appeared in a car park next to the sprawling grounds of the Milky Cloud Temple. They were Rose Scola and Blue Gorgeous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They say our friends will be here soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it a woman?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know. But I think it&#8217;s someone with glasses.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola nods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s been tough since the Pink Police got captured, so thanks to that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We don&#8217;t have to kill demoniacs today, do we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re here to retrieve the robot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Blue Gorgeous replies with a clear smile. Suddenly, Rose Scola peeked in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s a spy robot? Could it be a rat&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous sweated again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it? Is it something smaller?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It, it&#8217;s an insect.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Insects&#8230;&#8230;as in butterflies?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ants?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cockroaches&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Co,cockroaches&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola is speechless. She had not imagined the answer at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8230;&#8230;because this is the least conspicuous and &#8230;.. I don&#8217;t want it to look too much like a friend of justice, but butterflies make it look suspicious&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous fidgets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous is right, but a cockroach-shaped robot is too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;re going to retrieve it by ha,hand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye,Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola remained silent then continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are we going to infiltrate the base?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need. I will call in with the remote control. So please create a diversion”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;m going to go all out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Rose Scola opened the pouch attached to her waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also want to try out the gravity rounds. Those evil ones, they all think they&#8217;re zero-gravity rounds, so they might be in for a surprise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">４</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the captain&#8217;s office, Infinia was at loss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who should she choose as a breast-massager among her men? No one really stands out. But should she just go out like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to have one of her men rub her breasts? However, if she designates someone, they might take the initiative and touch&#8230;..her breasts again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At all costs, Infinia wanted to get results. Today, the Berzelia-sama is also participating in the base defence. She doesn&#8217;t want to show her anything but a disgraceful appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two Saint Agents appeared in compartment D4. Intercept through a false B gate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the woman&#8217;s announcement, Infinia ran out of the captain&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s go, boys!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They leave the antechamber and run through the underground corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The partner Infinia is teaming up with today is the Baranka Corps. She doesn&#8217;t like them very much but it&#8217;s rather convenient. If she is up against Aizenaha Corps, she can&#8217;t show how good her corps are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They went out through the false B gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pitch-dark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But darkness does not matter to the Demonian aliens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Baranka Corps was nowhere to be seen near the gate. It seems that they chased after the enemy first. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They are as selfish as ever.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia and the others also started to move.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The Baranka Corps would have been headed for D4. So it’s D3 for us.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following a sudden noise, a girl in a naughty costume with visible underboobs jumps out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia  threw a restraining ball at her with a hand launcher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the girl rolls on the ground and runs away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She jumped straight into the woods beside her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t let her get away!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia runs head first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia&#8217;s weapon of choice is speed. In an instant, she dives into the woods and catches the back of Rose Scola.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ve got her!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she suddenly flew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia  was hit by a cannonball from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Another zero-gravity shell!’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She remembered that Combatant Beta had caught it the day before.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ll catch it too.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She caught it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, her knees had fallen off.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wha──!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly..her feet were dug into the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her whole body felt heavy.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wha,what the hell is this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, it doesn&#8217;t explode properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola said and fired a second shot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time it exploded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the men fell to the ground. Infinia stuck her buttocks out and crawled to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s as if gravity is falling on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another one!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another shell is fired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gghh&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia writhes in agony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body feels like it is going to break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another footsteps are approaching. It was Blue Gorgeous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everything going well?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. It seems to be going well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous has her bow and arrow ready.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is bad’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia tries to escape, but her body is too heavy to do anything. The《Bondage Arrow》 was fired, and the entire Infinia corps was captured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola and Blue Gorgeous joined hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We did it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We really did it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of the allies of justice smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those Gravity rounds, they work wonderfully.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the best result we&#8217;ve gotten. Let&#8217;s get out of here before another squadron arrives.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right this way, then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another shells is being refilled and Rose Scola fires in rapid succession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Infinia&#8217;s body became lighter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If it gets lighter, it&#8217;s ours──’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she was about to jump, she was hit again by a second shell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body floated in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time she was too light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two agents target her body and Infinia leaps into the air. She goes over the height of the tall tree.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don’t tell me, we’re going to jump over the property as it is! Then, I’m going to be a POW&#8230;&#8230;!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a ball hit Infinia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of her hands were lifted upwards and she was entangled in a tree nearby and restrained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone had thrown the restraining ball at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oraa, agent~!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the Baranka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two or three boomerangs strike in quick succession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two agents retreat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They shoot gravity bombs while retreating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They collide with the boomerangs in mid-air. The two agents scatter to the left and right. It is possible they are trying to surround the Baranka Corps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Don&#8217;t get sandwiched! Go after Rose Scola!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barranca Squad Combatant X throws a boomerang. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Rose Scola heads for the fence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From D4 area to D5 area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it, don&#8217;t let her get away! Strip her!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A《Bondage Arrow》flew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka agilely leaps and dodges. But while he did so, the two agents who had fled into the D5 area jumped out of the fence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you going to escape?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Rose Scola pointed a shell at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the shelling fire,the visibility suddenly dropped to zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a smoke screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Combatants X and Y threw their boomerangs, only to return without any success. When the smoke screen cleared, the agents were gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Damn it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka is frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Footsteps approached from behind Infinia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just untie me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking it was a subordinate, Infinia called out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want me to untie you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman&#8217;s voice made her tremble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her huge, watermelon-sized breasts, which were about the size of a 4L, were covered by a crimson party dress with a long hem. It was fastened with a single button on the chest. Huge wings like pterodactyls extended from her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the real vampire &#8211; Belzeria, the director of the 081st Base Combat Directorate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">5</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia stood alone in the Director-General&#8217;s office, head bowed, in front of a huge desk. Sitting in the president&#8217;s chair in front of the black-painted desk is the base&#8217;s number two, Belzeria.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the most disgraceful result I&#8217;ve seen since I came here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slumped at the harsh words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She can&#8217;t even breathe a word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I promoted you to Dark Knight because you were so good, but it seems you haven&#8217;t lived up to my expectations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me another chance…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Berzelia glared at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed. Maybe I should demote you, then give you the second chance you speak of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Belzeria-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve made our decision.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Belzeria’s cold eyes look at Infinia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t have a breast-massager like Aizenaha ! With a good breast-massager, I am confident that I can be of service to Belzeria-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia spoke the topic out of the blue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Belzeria&#8217;s reaction was cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Having confidence is fine. All I want is results.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will show you the results, I promise! So give me one more chance, just one more!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia put her forehead on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could feel Belzeria looking at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is also a stern gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t a gentle gaze like the one she directed at Aizenaha.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it useless&#8230;&#8230;.? Will I be demoted&#8230;..?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Infinia was about to give up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope you have a clear idea on what you&#8217;re doing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve told my men.…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia lied. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no way forward. But if she doesn&#8217;t say this, she will be demoted now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a short pause of silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infinia was too scared to look up.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Have she found out that I&#8217;m lying&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine. But you only get one chance.”</span></p>
