<h3>Chapter 8: Trap</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the red vehicle stopped at an early morning junction, pedestrians looked at it curiously. It is not surprising, Clarissa thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are only 33 Ferrari Enzo&#8217;s in Japan. And her own body is just as rare and luxurious as this car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, she doesn&#8217;t have the same urges as yesterday. The ingredients of the Demonia candy seem to have left her body.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I wonder if that guy has already arrived at school’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa recalled the boy named Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She never thought she would have to let a monastic student touch her high-class body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it a humiliation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be humiliating to say the least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she also felt glad it was him. Who else would she have preferred to have milked her breasts but him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides &#8211; it felt good more than anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until he squeezed her, her breasts were itching to burst. It was much like an itchy sensation needed to be scratched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of the itch, scratching it would make it worse but the tingling in her chest was different.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tasted legal pleasure to the fullest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She climaxed from being squeezed and she climaxed from being sucked. When she got home and looked at her shorts, they were soaking wet.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If Yoh had forced himself upon me, would I have the strength to refuse&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, yesterday was yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shouldn&#8217;t get her hopes up that Yoh might be able to suck her chest again today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa almost giggled at the thought. She remembers  the same thing happened as a reward after he saved her from Baranka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A Ferrari was passing through the main gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It continued into the porch and slowed down rapidly. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Yoh opens the butterfly door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She handed her bag to Yoh and got out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is Yoh&#8217;s job to close the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She walked in the door and sat down on a chair. She throws out both of her legs. Yoh knelt down and helped Clarissa put on her own shoes and jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she started walking down the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh follows behind with her bag and Clarissa slows down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me tell you something so you don&#8217;t get the wrong idea. If you think you can do the same thing as yesterday again, you&#8217;re mistaken.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do I look like a misunderstood kind of guy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa probably thinks since he has Aizenaha and the Pink Police, Yoh is not worried about such things. Which is why he is calm about it. Also, there is a rumour that Infinia has also decided to co-own Yoh as a breast massager.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s kind of frustrating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa wanted him to obsess about yesterday. If he obsesses about it, it means that things were great between them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was better than Aizenaha, wasn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she deliberately said it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was amazing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you want to suck my breast again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa thought he would reply with a joke but Yoh has honestly expressed his intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s a little happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was better than Aizenaha.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I bigger?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yours bigger.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is the shape better?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your shape is different. Aizenaha&#8217;s is very pointy but Clarissa&#8217;s is rocket-like and provocative.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa is happy to hear it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll you suck it when I feel like it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you feel like it, I&#8217;ll suck you anytime.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cheeky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the cheekier the better. It&#8217;s boring if Yoh’s response was meek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">２</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did I really suck Clarissa&#8217;s boobs&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While listening to the fourth period lesson, Yoh remembered the incident yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lewd rocket-shaped breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spurting breast milk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa cumming…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh knows it was real but he never knew that he, a monastic student, would suck the boobs of a special student&#8230;he still can&#8217;t believe it happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What surprised him the most was that Clarissa said she would let him suck again if she felt like it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is she teasing me?’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is it a joke?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Will Clarissa really let me suck again?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, even if she is joking, there&#8217;s Rina-chan…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh opened his mobile phone. He is supposed to call her again today.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What clothes shall I have her wear&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bell rings for the end of fourth period and students begin to open their lunch boxes as the teacher leaves. The ones who were relaxed were the male students who had finished their lunchboxes early in the third period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the seat in front of Yoh, Kyoichiro Shirai has started eating his lunch. Every lunchtime, he feels miserable. At the smell of the nice fragrance, Yoh folds up his desk and runs out of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where are you going?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a woman&#8217;s voice chased after him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It seems that someone is calling someone else. It can&#8217;t be me.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nigorikawa Yoh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh stopped dead in his tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few metres away, Clarissa was standing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, don&#8217;t you want your lunch?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“yea,I&#8217;m just going to eat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you forgotten our promise?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Rosewells&#8217; staff came running in. Boy-style men carried French course meals.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Does she want me to help her?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Yoh returns to the classroom, his desk is spread out as it was. In addition, there was something strange on the desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a lunch box.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is Clarissa using his desk as a side table to eat?</span></p>

<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sit down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was ordered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t tell me she is going to ask me to feed her with chopsticks?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Yoh waits for her next command.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing? Eat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clarissa moved her face closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You promised.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh&#8217;s eyes widened as wide as he could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, they negotiated yesterday. But Yoh didn&#8217;t expect it to honoured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don&#8217;t want it, I&#8217;ll let you take it home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure you want me to eat it? Won&#8217;t I get a bill later?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not a petty person,Yoh.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, it&#8217;s true&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was astonished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of lunch had Clarissa prepared for Yoh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He opened the lid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lunch box had two tiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the top tier was a large piece of beef. It was a tender-looking sirloin steak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more &#8211; it was steaming hot.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No way, freshly cooked?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second tier was rice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh took a bite of the sirloin steak with chopsticks in his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was so soft it almost melted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a different level of tenderness from cheap meat. On top of that, it was so sweet! It was hard to believe it was meat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Omi beef, they say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: It is wagyu beef, don&#8217;t be confused. But ‘Omi’ is a name of a province thus specifically telling where the meat came from. Omi beef,Kobe beef and Matsusaka beef are top meat brands]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh tossed the sirloin steak into his mouth, absorbedly listening to Clarissa&#8217;s commentary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s warm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh never thought he&#8217;d get to eat such a feast in the middle of the day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s true that Clarissa promised to make a lunch box, but Yoh didn&#8217;t expect her to prepare such a high quality lunch box.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh is  a monastic student but at this moment, he is the winner. The only person in this classroom eating a better lunch than him is Clarissa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Satisfied?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh nodded enthusiastically, his mouth full of sirloin steak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I can power through today&#8217;s battle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">３</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rina sighed as she arrived at the Milk Cloud Temple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, too, Yoh is calling her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He will tease her breasts as he likes again. And Rina is sure that she will feel delighted again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But somewhere in the back of her mind, she is expecting it, because it really felt so good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she walked deeper into the temple, Rina recalled yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The agent, White Glass, looked familiar. She remembered hearing his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was not a very likeable person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she is not ready to tell it to Yoh. She is still, in her heart, on the side of justice. She is not a member of evil.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Those Agents, are they going to do something today?’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe they intend to.’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How will Rose Scola and Blue Gorgeous move?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">４</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barankasnorted when he saw combatant β enter the Aizenaha squad&#8217;s waiting room. Also, after dealing with that spectacle bastard, he will no doubt go to a private room reserved for slaves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, he probably intends to enjoy Pink Police&#8217;s body a lot.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Damn it&#8230;&#8230;he is having fun again&#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka gets angry so easily when he thinks of that man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Combatant Beta interfered with his relationship with No.29. In addition, he took possession of the pink police he was after. Not only that, he does not even try to obtain it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, he is also popular with Aizenaha and Infinia. He is enjoying the spring of his life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka love to fuck Pink Police at any cost, but only combatant Beta can enter the exclusive private room. The door is fingerprint-authenticated.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I must absolutely disqualify him &#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he glared at the closed door, an emergency buzzer sounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">５</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three agents were seen in the grounds of the Milky Cloud Temple</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Gorgeous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And White Glass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two female agents looked reluctant. Only White Glass looked refreshing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t really feel like doing this sort of thing very often, but &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fighting isn&#8217;t just about being fair. If you&#8217;re going to be fair, why send in spy robots?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rose Scola is silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Battles aren&#8217;t always pure. There&#8217;s always dirt during fighting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass insisted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no counter-argument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rose and I will create a joint diversion. Blue, please put this in the hands of the other combatants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, he handed over his smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">６</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh thought Aizenaha would be angry with him but she just continue to hugged Yoh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you cum more when you’re with Infinia, I won&#8217;t forgive you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pressed her breasts against him and whispered cutely. But before she could rub her breasts as usual, the agents had stormed in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just outside the entrance to False Gate B, the Baranka Corps was unusually gathered. The Aizenaha and Baranka Corps are not a good match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, no one can get along well with the Baranka Corps. Yoh heard that some troops want to be repatriated to the home planet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been waiting for you today”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s normal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha replies coldly while Baranka gives her a nasty look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, Mr.popular bastard. Have you been sucking on Aizenaha’s mama boobs today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha swung her whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka&#8217;s men jumped but Baranka didn&#8217;t budge an inch. He&#8217;s a loathsome person but he&#8217;s got guts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re attacking the wrong guy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve got the wrong target for your sarcasm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka sniffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s going to be difficult to work together today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Follow me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka said, leading his corps into the woods at night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Follow the Baranka corps.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Aizenaha&#8217;s command, You and Aizenaha’s corps started to move. The enemy will surely pincer Baranka and his men &#8211; that&#8217;s what Aizenaha predicted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh also confirmed that a new enemy had appeared the day before yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will they appear again?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They have powerful tools. The only weapons that the Demonia Salvation Planet has are the Numb Ball and the Restraint Ball. Both of the ball is to restrain and numbs the opponent who is hit directly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be nice if they developed more reliable weapons but the Demonia pride themselves on having no weapons other than those they can throw at the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh proceeded through the forest, spreading out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">None of the Baranka corps were in sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, an explosion occurred ahead. A blinding light shines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look out behind you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the sound of Aizenaha&#8217;s voice, Yoh looked to his left and right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thin sound was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He quickly bent down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An arrow pierced the trunk. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Blue Gorgeous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cold wind suddenly blew from directly above Yoh while he grabbed the restraining ball and turned around.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why is it from above?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking up, Yoh froze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A white cloak blocking the night sky &#8211; a new enemy, the White Glass, was flying ten metres above his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Combatant Beta!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh did not answer and threw the restraining ball.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was easily evaded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As we discussed earlier, here they come! Come on, Beta, come here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh tilted his head.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What is this man saying?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come down!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, you’re one of us now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass swooped down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He rushed forward, blasting a blizzard towards the Yoh. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh threw a second restraining ball, but missed again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While holding the third ball, White Glass was closing in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black shadow ran in front of Yoh. Shockwaves fly. Aizenaha swung her whip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White Glass flees into the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do not get in the way! Combatant Beta is one of us!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The agent&#8217;s shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am not one of you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh shouted back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha swung her whip again but the shockwave did not hit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beta, this is the end! That&#8217;s enough playacting! Get out of here! I have a present for them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blizzard suddenly blows. Yoh vision goes into whiteout.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Seriously&#8230;..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh covered his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he covered it, he couldn&#8217;t stand it and rolled over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the blizzard finally stopped, the tree trunks and leaves had turned white.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The agents!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha shouts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Combatant A,B,C looks around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the captain&#8217;s orders, three of them scattered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They eventually returned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re not here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re not here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh was out of breath.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What did he come to do? He seemed to think I was someone else. Who was he spying on?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three shadows emerged from the woods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were the Baranka corps that had been ahead of them. The biggest shadow in the middle is the Baranka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, well, well, it seems we have a traitor in our midst.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka looked at Yoh with derision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You talk too much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha retorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A traitor is a traitor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t accuse him without evidence.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Talk to me again when you see this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Baranka threw down a smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at his text messages.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aizenaha picks it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yoh looked in from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《Dear Combatant Beta. Today is my first sortie. You should stay out of today’s battle. Okay,Okay, I&#8217;ll ask Rose and Blue to go easy on Infinia so she doesn&#8217;t get demoted.》</span></p>
