<h3>Bonus Chapter &#8211; Our First River Romp</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right, let’s go fishing today.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a certain day, in the cave he made his home, Reito suddenly had this idea. His partner, Ullr, looked at him, curious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a reason behind this sudden desire to fish: living surrounded by nature, Reito recalled that he used to fish fairly often in his past life, so he wanted to try doing it in this world too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I need tools to fish though&#8230;a pole and hooks too&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was thinking about what to do, when Ullr barked with energy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? You want to catch fish too? That’s fine, but&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTU5OTM3MDgyMDYiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was perplexed, as he had no idea how the wolf Ullr could catch fish.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of checking out the location first, Reito and the eager Ullr left the cave and headed to a nearby river.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ — blub blub…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t swim!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several minutes later, Reito saved Ullr from drowning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr had jumped straight into the river, with full confidence — only to sink like a rock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed, then came up with an idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you can’t swim, say so first! Geez, you sure are a handful&#8230;okay, I’ll teach you to swim, so let’s go in the river together. Let’s start with the breaststroke.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Dog paddle? You absolute fool!! You’re not a dog, you’re a wolf!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woo…of&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr was intimidated by Reito’s stern glare. Overwhelmed, he started obediently practicing the breaststroke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haf, haf…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, no, no!! You won’t be able to go forward if you move your legs like that!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No complaints!! If you can reach the opposite shore, I’ll cook any meat you want tonight!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WOOF!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good!! Yes, like that!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito swam next to Ullr, like a strict yet passionate trainer, instructing him as he did.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed impossible at first, but little by little Ullr was getting the hang of swimming breaststroke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Ullr managed to swim 10 metres and reach the opposite shore. Reito embraced him and cheered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You did it, Ullr!! You can swim!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito congratulated his partner’s success.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their initial goal of fishing completely forgotten, they returned to their cave dwelling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr briskly hopped back on land and started walking. Reito stood up too to catch up with him, but— </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Owowowow!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy suddenly yelped in pain. Surprised, Ullr turned back and saw Reito on the ground, holding his legs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr ran back to Reito. He had started heavy exercise — Ullr’s swimming training — without warming up, so his legs paid the price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, a grimace of pain on his face, spoke to Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How could I forget it&#8230;in order to learn to swim, there is one thing more important than anything else&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before swimming&#8230;always do your warm-up&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof….”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s bark sounded like a dejected sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, they had to wait for Reito’s legs to become usable again before they could return to the cave.</span></p>
