<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years have passed since Reito was reborn in the new world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, he woke up early and practiced the sword in the rear garden. He swung the wooden sword Aria made for him, focused with his whole body and mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shah!! Haah! Waah! Kweh!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That last yell was pretty silly, young master&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wafful!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now you’re just asking for sweets!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah&#8230;Aria&#8230;is it time for breakfast…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. How long have you been swinging that sword…? You’re dripping with sweat&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had taken off his shirt before starting swinging practice, so Aria brought him a towel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His body was still immature, but because of the daily practice, it was well built for his age. His swings also had much better form than the beginning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last six months, Reito had acquired the Swordsmanship skill. It simply boosted the speed of his swings. Likewise, he also learned a new Battle Art.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To finish his training, he swung his sword down through the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had raised the wooden sword over his head and brought it swooping down, in a blow faster than the norm.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-30831392' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-30831392' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Battle Art normally used with axes: Reito had learned it after imitating Aria’s motions when she chopped wood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria, with a sigh, handed Reito a bucket of water.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re such a strange boy, young master. You have a magic-type job, but you learned a Battle Art for sword users&#8230;I’ve never seen anyone like that before.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wah&#8230;it’s cold!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes, let’s wash away the sweat now&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria wiped Reito’s sweat. He entrusted his body to her and looked at the wooden sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All he learned through the practice swings was just “Swordsmanship” and “Helmet Splitter”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To learn other skills and Battle Arts, he had to actually fight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one would ever seriously train a 6-year-old boy though. Reito tried asking Aria, but she never accepted his requests to be his sparring partner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried once again to win her over.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You really can’t fight with a sword, Aria?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a magic user, I told you&#8230;even if I could, I would never teach you anyway, young master. I finished wiping you, let’s go to the dining hall.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;aah, my soul hungers for battle&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you talk like a berserker now&#8230;let’s go already.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distance between Reito and Aria had grown wider for a time, but they were now back to normal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While following her to the dining hall, Reito looked at the wooden sword, her present.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTEwNjE4Mjc4NTUiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had made it sharper with Shape Change and improved its endurance with Matter Reinforcement, so for a wooden sword, it was very practical and easy to use.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effects created with alchemy skills faded over time, of course, but when he used them he could even chop through wood with the sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Matter Reinforcement is what let me learn Helmet Splitter too, now that I think about it.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his way to breakfast, Reito was lost in thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Until now, I just had to follow Airis’ advice, but learning new skills has become harder and harder. I should ask her if there’s something I can do&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they arrived in the dining hall, everyone else had already finished breakfast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After breakfast, Reito returned to his room and immediately started communication with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Aiemooon!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What part of me looks like a cat robot from the future, Reibita-kun?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexpectedly, Airis humored Reito’s joking way of calling her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You even know these things from my world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, I am the manager of the interdimensional space, after all. Gathering information and knowledge from your world is all too simple.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really&#8230;so do you know how my parents are doing too?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito asked the first question that came up in his mind, but Airis’ reply was nothing but serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;do you really want to know?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『No&#8230;never mind. I have a new family in this world, after all.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis probably realized how Reito truly felt, so she changed the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『By the way, you’re working very hard on your sword swings. Is it going well?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, I learned skills, but just two&#8230;I feel kind of stuck, to be honest.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;I see. Without someone to practice against, it’s not easy, is it&#8230;oh yes! Why don’t you try learning different skills then?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I had the same idea, actually. What skills do you think I should learn?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ tone became sort of playful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s time to practice magic, don’t you think? Truthfully, it is still early, but I think you could be able to manage it now.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Magic!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-awaited words filled Reito with joy, to the point most of his restraint flew out of the window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Magic!! Teach me magic, now!! Or else I won’t talk to you anymore!!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hey!! Did your mind become a baby’s too!? Calm down…! You’re the one that will be in trouble if we don’t talk anymore!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s true&#8230;sorry, I got too excited.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis waited for Reito to settle down, then explained in detail about the magic he should try to acquire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Your main job, Support Magician, is specialized in magic spells that provide support to your allies — exactly as the name says. Its exclusive skills are three: “Muscle Boost”, “Magic Boost” and “Recovery Boost”.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see, I see&#8230;what exactly do they do?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『First, Muscle Boost. This spell increases the target’s physical prowess. Its effects depend on the proficiency level: if you master it, this spell can improve physical abilities up to five times, even!』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-96341645' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-96341645' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Wow!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning that the skill was much more powerful than expected, Reito grew even more excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis, however, promptly shut down his rising fever.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『After the spell wears off, however, the body will pay the price for being pushed past its limits&#8230;causing most people to collapse on the spot.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Next, Magic Boost. This spell improves the power of offensive magic. If you master it, the target’s spells will be five times more powerful than normal!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Whoa, amazing!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Naturally, they will also use five times as much magic power.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Wha….』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, both Muscle Boost and Magic Boost came at a considerable price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was utterly dejected, but Airis’ explanation continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Lastly, Recovery Boost. This spell improves the target’s natural recovery abilities. It takes more time than standard healing magic, but can definitely heal the target.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;this one doesn’t have any disadvantages?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The recovery speed is a bit slow, but that’s about it.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery Boost did not seem to have a harsh cost like the two spells before it. Its effects weren’t very special either, though…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis then said she would reveal a very useful piece of information to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The major characteristic of the Support Magician job is its magic power capacity, which is one of the highest among all jobs. In video game terms, imagine a job that has a massive amount of MP, but barely any useful spells.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh&#8230;I&#8230;see&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ merciless evaluation had Reito feel rather conflicted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t the only negative trait of the Support Magician job, however.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Its greatest demerit, however, is the inability to learn Blast Magic.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Blast Magic? Like shooting with a gun or a cannon?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, in simple terms, you shoot magic power like a laser beam&#8230;which is also called Magic Cannon.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So basically, you can shoot magic beams from your hands&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, exactly. Blast Magic has high offensive power: even the low-grade spells that apprentices can learn are capable of defeating about 10 Goblins at once. The high offensive power, however, means that its magic power consumption is high too. It can’t be used in rapid succession, and the number of times it can be used in a day is also pretty limited.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, this high-powered Blast Magic was not unavailable to the Support Magician job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timidly, Reito asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Can the Support Magician learn any offensive magic, in the end…?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, it can, but&#8230;other than Support Magic, it only has access to basic grade magic spells, which all not magic-oriented jobs can learn too.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Basic grade magic&#8230;it definitely doesn’t seem strong&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, it’s also called lifestyle magic, after all. It’s not impossible to use it in battle, but&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Airis’ explanation ended, Reito was completely down in the dumps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He finally understood why the Support Magician was considered a hopeless job, though. He pulled himself together and reorganized Airis’ explanation.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-90036202' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-90036202' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So, the Support Magician only has not very efficient Support Magic and can’t use Blast Magic, one of the greatest weapons of Magician jobs. The basic grade magic it can learn has very limited offensive abilities.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s right. But there is a way to limit the burden of Support Magic on the body, though.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh? Really!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What do you think that could be?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden question threw Reito for a loop. He started thinking and quickly realized that Recovery Magic, the only one of the three without clear disadvantages, had to be the key.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Maybe, with Recovery Magic…?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Correct. By using magic that boosts the target’s natural recovery abilities, it is possible to lessen the burden on its body to the minimum.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Recovery Boost could lessen the damage caused by Muscle Boost to the target’s body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito assimilated the explanation and a new question popped up in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm? Then, depending on how you use it, Support Magic can be pretty useful too, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That might be true. Even so, Support Magicians, unable to use Blast Magic, is still considered a hopeless job. In this world, Magicians are highly regarded as an offensive type of job, even more than Swordsmen or Warriors. Blast Magic is the most efficient way to deal with monsters, after all.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Airis’ words, the Support Magician was not clearly inferior to other jobs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was convinced of it and swore to himself to master his job’s true potential.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the communication with Airis, Reito went to the rear garden.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, without further ado&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some light stretching, Reito tried casting the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Muscle Boost!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s body glowed in a white light, which faded after an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t feel like anything changed&#8230;did it really work?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsure of the actual effects of the spell, Reito tried using the Leap skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He jumped forward, and—&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here goes&#8230;whoooa!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— ended up jumping much farther than expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His momentum was so great that he missed his landing and stumbled, but managed not to fall. Reito turned around, to look at the distance he jumped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, the Leap skill allowed him to jump four meters at most. After activating Muscle Boost, he had jumped at least six meters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I just jumped a little&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then opened the status window and checked Muscle Boost’s proficiency.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The menu displayed the skill’s proficiency level as “1”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Airis said that the skill will be five times as effective if proficiency is maxed out&#8230;at level 1, I guess it’s a 150% boost?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-28751942' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-28751942' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito reached this conclusion, a jolt of pain suddenly struck his muscles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pain was so strong that he couldn’t stand anymore: he looked at his legs and found them shaking visibly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then hurriedly cast Recovery Boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-Recovery Boost…!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spell caused his body to glow white once, just like when he activated Muscle Boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little by little, he felt the pain leave his body. His legs stopped trembling and, after about 30 seconds, he could move again freely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew, it’s finally gone&#8230;it’s too slow to be used as healing magic though&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis explained that Recovery Boost healed the body by boosting its natural recovery abilities. Reito’s proficiency level was still low, so he could only heal light injuries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had also added that it could heal minor damage, but not missing limbs or any such grave wounds.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People with Healing Magician jobs can send their magic power inside the target’s body and restore even missing limbs apparently&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was disappointed by the minimal effects of Recovery Boost, but shook the feeling away and switched to the next experiment: the last Support Magic spell, Magic Boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here goes&#8230;Magic Boost!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried casting the spell on himself&#8230;but unlike before, there was no white glow this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, he recalled something Airis told him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh wait&#8230;Magic Boost doesn’t work on the caster’s own body…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis had indeed explained that, while Muscle Boost and Recovery Boost could be cast on the user’s own body, Magic Boost influenced magic power, so it was not to be used on magic itself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought of asking Aria to use magic on him and to attempt Magic Boost on it but quickly discarded the idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, how am I supposed to explain that I learned magic out of the blue…? Aria won’t show me her magic, anyway&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria did not use her magic anymore in front of Reito, since their game in the garden, maybe to prevent Reito from showing more interest in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling stuck, Reito looked down at his feet&#8230;and the flower patch, as well as the medicinal herbs growing in it, caught his eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It influences magic power&#8230;wait, there is a medicinal herb that restores magic power, right&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito remembered Aria telling him about that strange kind of herb with such effects when they worked together on the patch. It had unique blue star-shaped petals and was aptly called “Magic Power Herb”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Aria, the plant itself contained a small quantity of magic power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it really does have magic power, Magic Boost should work&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito pointed his palm at the Magic Power Herb.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid any potential trouble, he picked one of the herbs he had grown himself, the frailest looking one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Magic Boost.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one instant, the herb glowed white.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next instant, its withering petals became a luscious, deeper blue, brimming with color and vitality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it worked! Now I can practice Magic Boost too!!”</span></p>
