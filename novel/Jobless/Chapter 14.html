<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years had passed since Reito escaped from the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now fourteen years old, Reito was still living in the forest with Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had moved from the cave behind the waterfall to a new dwelling: after the Blood Bear incident, they moved to a cave that did not risk being attacked by monsters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, shall we go hunting?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these four years, Reito had grown visibly: he was now 150 cm tall. He cut his hair evenly at shoulder length. His features became sharper, but he took after his mother, giving his looks a touch of gentle handsomeness. On the other hand, the harsh life in the forest allowed his muscles to develop to a considerable extent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not the only one to grow, however: Ullr’s body had grown bigger and larger too &#8211; he was about the size of a small horse now. Reito could even ride on him when they traveled through the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hopped on his partner’s back and Ullr dashed off immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re as fast as the wind, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito scanned the forest for prey as they ran across it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, they were looking for adult Poark specimens, called Great Poark. They were approximately twice the size of normal Poarks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They would find one soon enough: the Great Poark spotted the duo too and snarled at them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROEEEENK!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s one!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grooowl!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Poark did not waste time and charged them. Ullr leaped into the air, Reito still on his back, jumping over the monster and landing behind it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oenk!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good! Stand back, Ullr!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito jumped down from Ullr’s back, stepped closer to the Great Poark and clenched his fist. He then activated the Craft Skill Heavy Strike.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OeenkAWGHR!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fist landed on the Great Poark’s body, protected by thick fur and fat, sending the massive boar-like beast flying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito smiled to himself, then created an Iceclad broadsword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Leap he could catch up with the Great Poark in a second: before the monster could land, Reito had already swung his sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROEEEENKKK!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadsword cut through the Great Poark, cleaving it in half. Reito dispelled the Iceclad Sword and called Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can have half, buddy.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-28928903' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-28928903' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked cheerfully and started feasting on the monster’s body. Next to him, Reito dissected the Great Poark, deftly collecting any useful parts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to have meat stew tonight&#8230;hey, what’s that?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the dissection, Reito found a red gem inside the monster’s body. He took it in his hands and noticed it was warm to the touch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious, Reito opted to ask Airis about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis&#8230;no, sorry, Airland.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You said my name right! No need for corrections!! Am I right!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly added the usual joke, which Airis promptly reacted to. Reito ignored her protests and proceeded to the main topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Who cares about that, tell me about this thing instead.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Will you ever change…? Anyway&#8230;that’s a Magic Stone.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, Magis Stones were gems imbued with magic power of a certain element: Magicians used them to reinforce their magic. There were not many places where Magic Stones could be found: for example, fire Magic Stones were found in volcanoes, while water Magic Stones could be found in the sea or a lake.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So why was there one inside a Poark’s body?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s not such a rare event, actually. Most monsters like Magic Stones very much after all.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They eat them!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They don’t actually eat the stones, but absorb the magic power in them. Large monsters consume Magic Stones to boost their physical abilities.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After learning of such curious monster habits, Reito thought of closing the communication, but Airis hurriedly stopped him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ah, please wait! Don’t close just yet, I have good news!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Good news?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Reito asked back and Airis continued, a giddy tone in her voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The bounty on your head was finally retracted. The kingdom apparently decided that you must have died.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A considerable amount of time had passed, so it probably wasn’t strange for the kingdom to reach this conclusion. Reito could now finally visit human settlements without fear of being found.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cheered, then a thought crossed his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ah&#8230;now that I think about it, I don’t have any money&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『When you arrive to a town, you can just sell the monster materials or wild herbs you have gathered until now. You have learned the Concoction skill too, so you could make some healing potions, for example.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Medicine, huh&#8230;I see.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito nodded, convinced, then Airis gave him some more advice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You can take Ullr with you too. If you make him wear a collar, you can make him pass for your pet dog.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Seriously!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was worried that leaving the Abyssal Forest would have meant separating from Ullr, so he was ecstatic to learn that wasn’t the case.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thus returned to his base and started making preparations to visit a human settlement, for the first time in years.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTU1MzQ3MDE0NDYiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One week has passed since Airis announced the good news to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His preparations complete, Reito was riding on Ullr through the Abyssal Forest. Once they were out, they found a vast grassland spreading before them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, moved by this new scenery, followed Airis’ instructions and headed to the nearest human dwelling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, let’s go!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, there was a small village near the grassland. It had been attacked by Goblins a few days prior, however, so no one lived there anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, Reito and Ullr arrived at the abandoned village. The buildings were ravaged and human corpses were strewn along the streets, just as Airis had said.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So this is the place&#8230;it really was destroyed. People were killed and just left here like this&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito proceeded through the village, walking among the countless corpses scattered everywhere. The dead bodies were already decomposing, filling the air with an awful stench. The duo eventually arrived at a large residence, probably the village elder’s home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stand watch, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito left Ullr in front of the main entrance and went inside the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first objective was to obtain clothes from the abandoned village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had brought clothes with him when he left the residence, four years before, but now that he had grown they wouldn’t fit anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, he used the Tech Skill “Sewing” to make do somehow, but they were well past their limits. Reito thus needed to visit a human settlement to find proper clothes, and decided to do so in the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After searching the drawers, Reito found clothes that probably belonged to the elder’s son.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Found them! The size&#8230;seems fine. They look just like the clothes I’ve been wearing until now too.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took everything useful and put it into his Storage Magic subspace. His current level was 40, so his Storage Magic’s weight limit was over 2000 kg.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After collecting clothes and changing, Reito then searched the house for valuables.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residents had all been killed, leaving no one to claim ownership of what was inside. Reito felt guilty about his actions, but collected what he could all the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, Reito was about to collect the kitchen ware, when he heard human voices from outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!! There’s a monster over there!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Isn’t that a White Wolf!? Why is there a rare monster in a place like this…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who cares!! We can make a killing with that thing’s hide!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WOOF!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hurried outside and found three armed people facing Ullr: a boy and a girl about his age and a large, relatively balding middle-aged man.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr howled loudly, ready to fight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait!! Calm down, Ullr!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stepped in front of Ullr, causing confusion among the trio.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? Who the hell are you!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A survivor!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Someone survived that? For real!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito turned towards the group, as Ullr rubbed its snout against him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good boy, good boy&#8230;that must have been scary.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gently rubbed Ullr’s head, much to the three’s surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what!? That guy tamed the White Wolf…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way you can tame a monster…!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe my eyes&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three newcomers were apparently adventurers: they each wore the bronze adventurers’ badge on their chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, thinking of getting away before things turned troublesome, called Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked in agreement. Before they could leave, however, the boy from the group spoke to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, wait! Are you from this village?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I just happened to pass by. I wanted to make sure if there really weren’t any survivors.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;by the way, is that wolf your Covenant?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cove&#8230;what?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cocked his head to the side, then mentally called Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hello~?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I don’t even have a name anymore now? Anyway&#8230;Covenants are monsters tamed via Covenant Magic, a technique used by those with the Monster Tamer job. Support Magicians like you cannot learn Covenant Magic, though.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see, thank you.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thanked Airis and cut the communication. He then turned towards the group again and answered their question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He is not a covenant, but like family to me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Family? That wolf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is that supposed to mean? How can you tame a monster without magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio tried approaching Ullr, causing him to react warily.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrooowl!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Easy, easy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine….”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-82007334' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-82007334' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito easily calmed Ullr’s tempers. The three adventurers were thus convinced that the White Wolf was indeed tamed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re off, then.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started walking away, but the boy stopped him again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait a second!! You’re not that White Wolf’s master, are you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you, there’s nothing like that between us.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s reply caused a shift in the trio’s attitude: they quickly moved to surround him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehehe&#8230;in that case, we can deal with you here and take that wolf for ourselves, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“White Wolf materials are really rare, you see? Too bad for you, but it’s coming with us.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three adventurers, slowly but surely, closed in on Reito and Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, mentally sighing at the hopeless situation, was about to take the bow from his back, when the middle-aged balding man of the group jeered at him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Judging from that busted up bow, you don’t even have enough money to buy a weapon, huh? I’ve never even seen someone using a weapon they made themselves!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Surrender now, and we’ll spare your life.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehe&#8230;not that you look like you could put up much of a fight.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three adventurers came closer, their ill intentions painted on their faces. Reito and Ullr were now standing back to back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a classic development&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Reito whispered to himself, then called Airis to know his opponents’ fighting level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, these people look like adventurers, but can I win against them?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Those three are not adventurers, but thieves pretending to be. As you are now, you can defeat them easily.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Thieves? Really?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A family of thieves, yes. The badges they wear are stolen. The father is a wanted criminal, so you could receive a reward if you brought him to the kingdom’s army.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;good.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with Airis, let go of his bow and put up his fists.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three thieves were puzzled by his sudden change in strategy, but they would soon learn what Reito meant by it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Basic Grade&#8230;whoa!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what the hell!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito instantly created more than 30 Fireballs all around himself, which he shot at the thieves’ feet: the resulting explosions sent all three of them flying away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito waved away the cloud of dust and smoke, then looked at the three aggressors. The boy and girl fainted, probably because of the impact of the explosion, but the father was still conscious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pulled himself back on his feet and spoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwah&#8230;d-damn it&#8230;you were a Magician!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, you’re tough, huh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was honestly impressed. The man was about to take the knife he carried at his waist, but Ullr charged before he could.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr leaped in the air, then precisely landed with his front paws on the man’s face. The father was knocked out immediately, foaming at the mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr returned to Reito’s side and received a head pat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good job, Ullr.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These people&#8230;were really nothing special.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still in disbelief at defeating a wanted criminal so easily, Reito tied the three with rope he found among their belongings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then wondered how he could transport them, and decided to ask Airis for advice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ai-Lin?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, Airis did not ignore Reito’s running gag.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『To be honest, I don’t mind that Chinese-sounding name, but my name is Airis. What is it?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『How far is the nearest city?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I wouldn’t call it a city, but there is a fairly large town to the north. If you’re wondering how to carry the thieves, there’s an ox-drawn carriage in the outskirts of the village. You could fit for Ullr to pull, what do you think?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Make a wolf-drawn carriage, huh&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito left the thieves and went to check the place where Airis said he could find the carriage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole village had been ravaged, but the carriage was unscathed — it probably failed to attract the Goblins’ interest. The same could not be said for the ox, however: only bones remained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So this is the carriage. Looks like it might be heavy, do you think you can pull it?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr was more than confident.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately used Shape Change to fit the carriage for Ullr to pull, then returned where he left the thieves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was about to load the three on the carriage, when he noticed a large group of white horses approaching from the village entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on now?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s Observing Eye revealed that young women clad in armor were riding on the horses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as they arrived at Reito’s location, the band of white horses surrounded it. They numbered over 50. Reito and Ullr warily watched how they were going to act: one of the young women got down from her horse and approached them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do not move a muscle!! What were you doing here? Why are those people tied up?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young woman who started questioning Reito had black hair and auburn skin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differently from the others, she did not wear armor, but only carried a sword on her back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her black hair reached down to her waist; her features still showed a hint of childishness, while her eyes burned bright red like rubies. The rest of her body seemed much more mature than her youthful face: her chest was well developed, her abdomen and legs as toned as an athlete.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-53019571' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-53019571' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young woman glared at Reito sharply.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Answer already!! Know that based on your words, we might be forced to apprehend you!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hesitates and all the mounted women draw their weapons. Reito called Airis in order to come up with a way out of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Miss Airis?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, I’m a miss now? In all seriousness, no more name jokes from now on, okay? Anyway&#8230;they are Valkyrja, one of the knight orders of the Baltros kingdom. The woman who spoke to you is the first princess of the kingdom — in other words, the first daughter of the previous king. And your cousin.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『My cousin!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t help but react loudly to the unexpected news.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Her name is Nao, so she is usually referred to as “Princess Nao”. A princess general, so to speak.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, Reito’s newfound cousin, seemed to be 16 or 17 years old.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had heard about the previous king’s daughters from Airis, soon after he was reborn in this world, but never expected to meet one in a place like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised that she could lead a band of knights at her age, Reito asked Airis another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Then, why is a daughter of the previous king in this village?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I told you that this village was attacked by Goblins, yes? This village, however, was protected by a Barrier Stone and Decay Stone. It would be normally impossible for monsters to approach it, let alone attack it, but as you can see, it happened. They have come to inspect the village. You are not very far from the royal capital, you see.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really&#8230;oh right, she asked me what I was doing, what do you think I should say?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I believe you should honestly say you captured the thieves. But also pretend that you are one of the village’s survivors.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Got it. Should I say my real name? I was a wanted criminal until recently, after all&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s not a problem. Your wanted poster showed your portrait and crime, but not your name. Your existence is treated as a secret in this kingdom, so the daughters of the previous king do not know about you. At the very least, they could not realize your true identity with just your name.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The only information they posted to catch me was my face…? Anyway, I’m not a wanted criminal anymore, so I can just tell the truth now, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s right. There are few actual survivors, if at all, so one should be able to find out even if you pretend to be a villager. If you need anything else, please call anytime.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Got it.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with Airis and time started flowing again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned towards Nao and answered her questions without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m&#8230;from this village. My name is Reito.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reito&#8230;you are one of the survivors?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. A few days ago, when the Goblins attacked the village, I managed to run away somehow&#8230;but I had nowhere else to go, so I came back.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;what about these three individuals?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao pointed at the tied up thieves. Reito replied calmly, without losing his cool.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are thieves. They tried to steal from the village, so I captured them.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing Reito’s explanation, Nao thought silently for a while. The other knights too whispered among themselves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, seemingly convinced, then turned towards Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You said you are a villager, but what about this wolf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s like family to me, we were practically raised together. He doesn’t attack people.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Reito’s words, Ullr did not miss the opportunity to whine as meekly as he could.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-is that so&#8230;it is quite large, though&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao seemed slightly perplexed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito called Ullr closer and rubbed his head, showing how he was used to human contact. Witnessing how the White Wolf happily buried his face in the boy’s chest, the knights put down their weapons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, however, still looked at Reito with suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You said you are from this village, yes? How did you survive until today?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;I wandered the grasslands.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The grasslands? You did not encounter any monsters there?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did, but he chased them away every time.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked proudly. White Wolves were much more powerful than average monsters: it was true that grassland monsters could not be a match for him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, looking at Ullr, asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That White Wolf could have chased away the Goblins too, could it not? Did you run away by yourself?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s words trailed off. He immediately took Airis’ offer and contacted her for advice: as soon as he called her name, she replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please say that you raised Ullr in a cave near the village. If you say that you kept him outside the village, so that the other villagers wouldn’t be scared, it should work.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thanked Airis, closed the communication and explained as he was told.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a cave near this village, that’s where I kept him. We lived together in the village when he was small, but when he got bigger some adults were scared of him, so&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the knights approached Nao and whispered in her ear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, there are indeed several caves in the forest near this village. It’s possible that&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;next question, then. If you truly were born in this village, you should know the name of the elder. Say it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately contacted Airis for the answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The village elder’s name is Rowle.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the lightning-quick communication, Reito answered the question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;is that true?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao asked one of her knights for confirmation. She took out a piece of parchment, read it and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s suspicions did not seem to be fully cleared yet, however: she pointed to the tied up thieves and asked Reito another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you capture these three? Did you use the wolf?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-95485772' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-95485772' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I defeated them with magic.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Magic? You’re a magician?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, yes&#8230;just a Support Magician, though.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito answered honestly, but Nao reacted indignantly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Support Magician!? Are you trying to make a fool out of me!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t understand why Nao would get so angry: as it turns out, she couldn’t believe that a “hopeless” job holder could catch a group of thieves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am going to ask one more time. How did you capture these thieves? Did you use the wolf? Or are there any other survivors?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like I said, I used magic&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enough lies!! Support Magicians cannot use offensive magic!! Or perhaps your sub job lets you use it!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, my sub job is Alchemist.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-you damned fool!! They’re both hopeless jobs!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s anger built up even more, but Reito continued speaking the truth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew very well that in this world his two jobs were considered “hopeless”, but he had never seen anyone react so harshly, with the exception of his father.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s indignation prompted the other knights to draw their weapons again and surround Reito and Ullr. The latter reacted by baring his fangs and growling, but Reito calmed him down and turned again towards Nao.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Support Magicians too can use magic. I may not be able to use Blast Magic, but I can still use basic grade magic.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so&#8230;and how is lifestyle magic useful at all in this situation?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lifestyle magic can be used offensively, actually. If I prove it, will you believe me?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;why not. Prove it, then.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao nodded quietly, then motioned at the other knights to lower their weapons. She then quickly ordered them to clear enough space for Reito to use magic easily.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito made sure he had enough space, then extended his palm forward and prepared to activate magic&#8230;but first, he contacted Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, how much magic should I show to make them believe me?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『How many times must I tell you that my name is&#8230;oh, you said it right. Don’t use anything too flashy, or they’ll ask you why you didn’t use it to protect the village.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Got it.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication, then materialized 10 Fireballs around himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So many&#8230;all at the same time!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe it&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valkyrja knights were in disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Nao, however, simply frowned. She was surprised that Reito could summon so many Fireballs at once, but she didn’t think it was enough to defeat the three thieves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong? If that’s all you can do— ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here I go.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when Nao opened her mouth, Reito pointed his palm downwards. The Fireballs floating in midair rained down: when they hit the ground, they caused it to explode, as if there were landmines buried underground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and the knights reacted with even more surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fireballs were relatively weak by themselves, but if they struck at the same time they could cause considerable damage. Reito had trained the proficiency level of his basic grade magic to the maximum, so his “lifestyle” spells were very different from the average person’s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights were sincerely impressed by the power of Reito’s Fireballs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-incredible&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What power&#8230;it’s comparable to Blast Magic.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the knights whispered something to Nao.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, this man’s words might be true&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh&#8230;I know that already!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao interrupted the knight, turned towards Reito and apologized.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen, I&#8230;I must apologize. I can see now that it would not be difficult for you to capture thieves like them&#8230;I am sorry for doubting you.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, well&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was perplexed by Nao’s sudden sincere apology.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glanced at the thieves, then gave orders to a knight, who brought her a small satchel. She then gave the satchel to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These thieves are wanted criminals. This is the reward, 30 silver coins.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, thank you very much.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hurriedly took the satchel: he looked inside and found a large amount of silver coins.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One silver coin corresponded to 10,000 yen: in other words, Nao had just given him 300,000 yen. (TL Note: 10,000 yen is roughly 100 USD, 300,000 yen a little less than 3000 USD)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao then spoke again to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe you are from this village. In that case, however, I wish for you to assist our inspection. Can you tell us in detail what exactly happened here?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;yes, okay.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ voice popped in Reito’s head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I believe it is my turn, yes? Make sure you listen to their questions well.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao started asking detailed questions about what happened to the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not know anything, of course: he continued pretending to be a villager, communicating with Airis to answer Nao’s interrogation.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, through Airis, answered Nao’s questions about the events that transpired in the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, what happened was as follows:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days before, a pack of Goblins attacked the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were not average Goblins, however: they neutralized the Barrier Stone and Decay Stone the village was protected by, then invaded it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two Magic Stones were the same mysterious protective charms that protected the residence Reito grew up in: normally, monsters could not even get close to them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decay Stones emitted a powerful stench that monsters loathed, while Barrier Stones created invisible walls that repelled monsters’ attacks. Each stone, however, had a weakness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the monsters could protect themselves from the stench, they could get closer to Decay Stones: Barrier Stones were also activated at will, so if there was no one standing guard, the barrier would not be activated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins that attacked the village acted as if they knew everything about these weak points.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wrapped pieces of cloth around their faces to shield themselves from the Decay Stone’s stench, then used bow and arrows to shoot down the soldiers standing guard in the turrets. The sentinels were thus killed before they could activate the Barrier Stone, leaving the village unprotected against the Goblins’ invasion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins were all armed just like humans apparently. Some of them even wore armor stolen from adventurers or soldiers of the royal army.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village was taken over in no time: most of the villagers who fled to the grasslands were attacked and killed by other monsters. A few barely managed to find shelter in other villages, but most of them were gravely wounded and died soon after.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking over the village, the Goblins collected everything they deemed useful and left immediately, leaving only the corpses of the villagers behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao listened to Reito, her arms crossed, but she didn’t seem convinced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I can’t believe my ears. How could mere Goblins accomplish something like that…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the knights proposed her hypothesis about the events.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, if I may, the village was riddled with human corpses. Since Goblins dislike human flesh, it would not be strange for that to happen: if other types of monsters had invaded the village, they would have either eaten the corpses or left no trace of them.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and the other Valkyrja knights all had troubled expressions on their faces.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-50061143' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-50061143' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem was not the credibility of Reito’s words, but the possibility that Goblins could exhibit intellect so similar to humans.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao looked Reito in the eyes and asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did the weapons and armor used by the Goblins have any particular characteristics? Even the smallest detail is fine, please tell me all you can remember.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Characteristics&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had not actually seen the Goblins, so he fell deep in thought. He mentally called Airis to receive her advice again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please say that you don’t know about the equipment, but some of the Goblins had extremely large bodies, on the level of Orcs.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thanked Airis for her quick wit and related to Nao what he was told.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember that some of the Goblins were as big as Orcs, but not much else&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goblins as big as Orcs&#8230;could those have been Goblin Knights? They tend to lead the pack, so their presence would explain the Goblins’ organization&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goblin Knights?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cocked his head to the side. Then, once again Airis’ voice echoed in his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Goblin Knights are advanced Goblins, an evolved form, so to speak. Such monsters are generally called Evolved.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought to himself that it had become much faster to communicate with Airis than before, then decided to ask Nao the reason why she came to the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;lady princess, may I ask why you are here?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No need to address me like that. We came here after receiving a report of the Goblins’ attack, that’s all. Normally, the local guards would have been dispatched, but I was concerned by the fact that there are reports of other villages and towns suffering because of Goblins I thus decided to come to inspect the village in person.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More importantly, what are you going to do? If you have nowhere to go, we could provide you shelter.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, no&#8230;I’m thinking of going to live in another town with him. I don’t have a home or family anymore, so&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTIyODY5OTc2ODQiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-is that so&#8230;I apologize for asking something like that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, feeling awkward, looked away from Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito actually planned to travel in order to cross outside the kingdom’s borders, but since it would be strange for a normal villager to say they were going to leave on a journey, he thought up an excuse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, unaware of Reito’s real circumstances, changed the subject.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, the magic you showed us was fairly impressive. Why don’t you become an adventurer?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An adventurer?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the knights frowned at the word.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, if I may be so bold&#8230;a hopeless job holder would not survive long in that profession.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had always been interested in the adventurer trade, so he couldn’t help but become a little excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at him, Nao took out a piece of parchment, wrote something on it, and gave it to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll give you this.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something to prove your identity. Now that your village is no more, there is nothing to prove who you are. I imagine there is no one that could vouch for you either, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the parchment: it showed Nao’s name and an emblem portraying a crossed sword and shield — probably a royal seal. It also bore a statement that Nao, first princess of the Baltros kingdom, vouched for Reito’s identity..</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gratefully accepted the proof of identity. Just then, a knight approached Nao.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, the inspection is complete. Let us return to the capital.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right&#8230;you come too. We will escort you to the nearest town.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, thank you very much.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Someone let him ride on their horse!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, that’s fine, I can ride on him.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito climbed on the back of the energetic Ullr. Nao was surprised, but kept her composure and gave the order to depart. According to her, the nearest town was a few hours away on a horse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, riding behind the Valkyrja knights, observed them on the way to the nearest town.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that all knights were women, but looking more closely he realized that they were all very young, ranging from their teens to twenties, and all had beautiful refined features.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious to know the reason, Reito approached the shortest knight of the group, who was riding at the tail end.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, excuse me, may I ask you a question?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wauh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short knight, with a dog-like yelp, turned towards Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dog ears grew on her head; while the armor made it hard to see, she appeared to have a tail too. Reito quickly understood that she belonged to the Beast race.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, why are there no men among the knights?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, you’re talking to me!! That’s because the princess doesn’t like men!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…? She doesn’t…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled his conversation with Nao. She was harsh at first, but in the end, she even made a proof of identity for him. Reito found it strange that such a person disliked all men.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a black-haired knight that heard their conversation slowed down her horse to match Reito’s speed and joined in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have never seen the princess act so kindly to a man. She is the type of person who values those with talent, however, so she might have taken a liking to you.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, really?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wauun!! Your magic was awesome! I want to learn how to do that too!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-95697172' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-95697172' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone can do that, with some practice&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fireball was basic grade magic, after all: if they practiced consistently, anyone could do what Reito did. Very few people, however, ever believed in the possibilities of basic grade magic to the point of maxing out its proficiency. Because of that, the actual offensive power that basic grade magic could attain was not generally known.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then asked the two knights another thing he was curious about.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;I can understand that there are no male knights since the princess dislikes men, but why are you all so young?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because we can use magic as well as weapons. The magic power of Magicians peaks in their teens or twenties: after they turn 30 years old — though there are exceptions — magic power decreases year by year. That is why there are only young knights in our order.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t use magic, but I’m confident in my sword skills and applied&#8230;and they accepted me!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito nodded, convinced by their explanations. The next moment, the cry of a monster was heard from the front.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kreeeeeeh….”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-monster!! A monster appeared!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights’ agitated voices reached Reito’s ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked in their direction and saw a large worm-like monster in the distance, probably over 2 meters tall. He was taken aback but did not fail to contact Airis for help.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, what in the world is that?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is called a Sandwurm. Normally, it is no threat to humans and is even well-loved by farmers, as it provides nutrition to the soil. It should not attack unless provoked.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see, then we’re not in danger&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Most women find it disgusting to look at, though. Some even faint after seeing one. Also, if you don’t kill it in a particular way, Sandwurm corpses secrete pheromones that attract their brethren in large quantities. Take care, okay~?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;eh?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ last words sounded very ominous, but communication was cut off before Reito could say anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time started flowing again and Reito looked in front. The knights, sword in hand, were preparing to do battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used his Far Sight Tech Skill and saw Nao, her complexion sickly and pale. She had drawn her sword too, but it was shaking visibly: she looked like she could faint at any moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C-c-calm down..! Do not lose composure&#8230;a warrior of the kingdom never loses composure…!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess!? Please do not push yourself too hard!! We know you have a phobia of monsters!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights supported the wobbling Nao. Reito was surprised by how shaken she was, so the black-haired knight riding close to him explained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the princess was still a child, she was attacked by a monster and suffered a grave wound. Since then, every time she faces a monster, no matter how weak and puny, she becomes unable to fight, just like that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh!? Why did she come to inspect a Goblin attack, then!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t help but react — but the commotion ahead was growing louder and louder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, calm down, please!! We can easily dispatch a monster like this by ourselves&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights tried chasing away the Sandwurm, to let Nao regain her composure, but the monster approached them without the slightest fear or hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kreeeh……!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, all reason gone, started swinging her sword wildly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waaahhhhh!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-princess!? No, you mustn’t!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights frantically tried to stop Nao, to no avail: their captain wouldn’t stop wildly swinging her sword. It ended up exciting the Sandwurm, which came closer and closer to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Nao’s white steed lost control too, threatening to make her fall off the saddle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess!! You filthy beast…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the knights, furious about the perceived Sandwurm threat, rushed in to strike it down. Reito, who had been watching from a distance, yelled at her to stop.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, don’t do that! If you kill it, it’ll release pheromones and more will come!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knight ignored Reito’s words, however, and cut down the monster. At the same time, the Sandwurm spat out a yellow liquid from its mouth.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-21067022' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-21067022' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSczJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI2MTA1NjkzNDA2Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kreeeeeeehhh!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waaah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-is this stomach acid!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the Sandwurm’s yellow spit landed, the soil started fuming and melting. The ranks of the Valkyrja members, shocked and upset, fell into disorder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized they likely did not know of the Sandwurm’s habits and decided he had to ask Airis for advice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, what should I do?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Sigh&#8230;okay. Sandwurms will calm down once they eat their favorite food, monster remains.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Thank you.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication, then accessed his Storage Magic: it was a bit of a pity, but he took out some Great Poark meat on the bone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, on Ullr, rode closer to the Sandwurm, waving the meat around.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!! Look here!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what are you doing!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s dangerous, stay away!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Reito suddenly run towards the monster, the knights raised their voices to stop him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kreeereeeh…..!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandwurm noticed the meat in Reito’s hands and slowly approached him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, while contemplating the view of the gigantic worm creeping towards him — which seemed right out of a horror movie — handed it the meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grroooowl….!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, calm down, buddy&#8230;you’ll get yours later.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr growled at the approaching Sandwurm, but Reito calmed him down. The Sandwurm realized they were not hostile and slowly extended its head towards the meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kreeeeh.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandwurm took small bites out of the meat at first, then swallowed it whole. Once apparently full, it started gleefully rolling around in front of Reito and Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little while before, Nao had come closer to Reito: looking at the merrily squirming Sandwurm, she asked him a question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is&#8230;everything okay?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, no problem. Sandwurms are harmless to humans.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried touching the Sandwurm’s body, but the latter did not show any particular reactions: soon enough, it burrowed underground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valkyrja knights breathed a sigh of relief, but then the Sandwurm poked its head out again and spat out some minerals</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kreereeh!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster then took off for good. The minerals it had left were gemstones shining bright green.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh? Is that a thank you gift for the meat? Hey, could this be&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito thought he had seen that gem before, somewhere&#8230;Nao reacted with surprise too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;that’s a Barrier Stone crystal!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito picked up the gemstone left by the Sandwurm. It was coated in stomach acid, but it was still a precious Barrier Stone crystal. Thinking he was going to wash it afterward, he put in his Storage Magic subspace for the time being.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights were standing there, not knowing what to say, then Nao bowed to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, well&#8230;I must apologize for acting so shamefully just now. If possible&#8230;please keep what you saw to yourself.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s fine by me, but&#8230;are you really okay?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-59256168' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-59256168' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I&#8230;I always end up like that when I see a monster since a long time ago&#8230;especially disgusting-looking ones, I really can’t stand them. Oh, what am I even saying&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao had not completely regained her composure just yet, so she ended up talking more than she wished to.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found it strange herself to reveal her weakness so easily to someone she had met that day for the first time: at the same time, she curiously felt that Reito was not a mere stranger to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito also felt something akin to familial affection towards Nao. He couldn’t tell her about his real identity but meeting someone related to him felt moving nonetheless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the two felt this peculiar familiarity, one of the knights spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, I believe we should ride on ahead.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. To think we would find a Sandwurm, though&#8230;do they often appear in these parts?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was caught unprepared by Nao’s question, but Airis quickly came to the rescue.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That Sandwurm was kept by farmers from “your” village, Reito. It appears to have adapted to the wild though.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito related Airis’ explanation to Nao, without creating suspicion. The group then departed again towards the nearest town.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few hours later, Reito was learning the current state of the kingdom from Nao and the other Valkyrjas.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Nao had each got down from their steeds and talked while walking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was eager to become friends with the first family he met after his parents, while Nao too was interested in him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then asked her a question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess Nao, do you have a Swordsman job?”</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20755" src="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" srcset="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito-204x300.jpg 204w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito-660x969.jpg 660w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito-66x96.jpg 66w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NaoAndReito.jpg 1009w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, my jobs are Knight and Martial Artists. Don’t say I’m a musclehead, or I’m cutting you down right here.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll never say something like that! Are Knights different from Swordsmen?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, normally the Knight job is considered to be the superior version of the Swordsman job. That does not mean, however, that all Knights are superior to Swordsmen. Even if both use the sword, there are things they are better or worse at.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;since Valkyrja is a knight order, all members have the Knight job too?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the other members of the group, but Nao shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if we are a knight order, there is no rule for the members to have the Knight job. It is possible to learn how to use a sword even without that job, after all. Greater effort becomes necessary, however.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes! I know that well&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito replied emphatically, and Nao looked at him, wide-eyed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;you do?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao was puzzled by Reito’s statement, as it implied that he trained with the sword too. Since the town came into view, however, she did not press the matter further.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked in the distance, using Observing Eye and Far Sight, and saw a building surrounded by a brick wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was finally going to visit a town, for the very first time in his new life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito whispered to himself, but Nao heard him and explained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s Adventure City. Most if not all adventurers who wish to leave their mark in history come to this town to make a name for themselves. As I said before, if you’re interested why not become an adventurer?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, as a hopeless job holder, it may be a harsh world to live in, but I feel that you have what it takes to become a first-rate adventurer. No, I expect that you will.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao smiled at Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That instant, Reito decided to become an adventurer. Eventually, he would accomplish achievements no smaller than any other adventurer in the history of the world— </span></p>
