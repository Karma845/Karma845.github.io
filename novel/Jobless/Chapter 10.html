<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that night, Reito started sneaking out of the residence regularly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could do so only at night, so his exploration range was limited, but he continued hunting monsters every night. Through this new lifestyle, he encountered all sorts of creatures.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Horned Rabbits: rabbit-like monsters with a single horn sprouting from their foreheads. They were weak physically, but extremely quick, so they made for good chasing practice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day too, Reito was training in the forest, chasing Horned Rabbits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Koyuuuun!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m catching you, buddy! Even if your cry is that cute!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horned Rabbits had very small bodies, making it very hard to track them. Reito was now trying to catch his prey without using Leap or other skills, but only with his actual physical abilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was now close enough to reach the rabbit beast, so he stretched his hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a little more&#8230;wah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Koyuun!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that exact moment, he stumbled on a rock and crashed, face flat against a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito grimaced, thinking he had lost the Horned Rabbit&#8230;but then saw something moving near his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked down and realized he was holding the Horned Rabbit in his arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Koyuuuuun…!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did it!! Agh! Ouch&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half overjoyed, half in pain, Reito then saw a status window appear before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Swift Legs” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, surprised by the unexpected skill acquisition, checked its description. It raised the user’s movement speed apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smiling, Reito talked to the Horned Rabbit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks, buddy. But I’m not letting you go.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Koyuun!?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-54911052' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-54911052' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito materialized the ice blade and used it to sever the little creature’s head from its neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at the horn growing on the monster’s head and recalled Airis’ advice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『If you grind Horned Rabbit horns to dust, you can use them as an ingredient for invigorating medicine. It can be quite valuable, so I advise you to collect it if you find one in the wild.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito extracted the horn, activated Storage Magic, and put it in the subspace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then took out his cooking utensils and prepared to start a fire. It was dangerous to light fires in the forest, but there was a skill he wanted to learn at all costs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito skinned the Horned Rabbit and drained its blood. Seeing his hands move so deftly despite not having any knowledge about skinning animals, he couldn’t help but laugh wryly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Dismantle skill is sure useful at times like these&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried starting the fire, then realized something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, right&#8230;I could just heat it up with magic.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water and fire created via magic normally disappeared quickly, but not if the user cast them continuously. Being a Support Magician, Reito had a considerable quantity of magic power, so he decided to create Fireballs under the pot, as sources of heat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He poured oil inside the heating pot, then the meat of the Horned Rabbit he skinned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like this, Airis?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The fire seems to be a bit weak, you have to make more or it won’t work.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thus continued cooking, while following Airis’ instructions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little while later, a very pleasant smell rose from the pot. The meat was apparently ready, so Reito put it on a plate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks pretty good&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horned Rabbit meat was very delicious, making it a popular source of nutrition among adventurers. Reito, excited, took the first bite.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had simply cooked the meat, but it was very juicy and delicious. Thrilled, Reito quickly wolfed it all down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So good!! But&#8230;I didn’t learn the Cooking skill.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s real objective was to learn the Cooking skill: he had not succeeded this time but learned a bit of how to cook meat at least, so he thought it was enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing his meal, Reito looked at the bones remaining on the plate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guess I should get rid of them.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was about to use Fireball to burn the bone to ashes when he felt a presence behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned around and found a massive monster, a bipedal creature with a boar-like face.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTc0MDUzNzUxNDIiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOOOOOOHR!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An Orc!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster looked just like an Orc, a familiar presence in many games in Reito’s former world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bulging Orc’s nose was twitching violently. It had been attracted by the smell of Horned Rabbit’s meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the bones on Reito’s plate, The Orc roared even louder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOOOAAAHR!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orc suddenly lunged, so Reito activated Leap to jump backward. The movement, however, caused him to drop the Horned Rabbit bones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orc picked up the bones and flicked them in its mouth, crushing them under its fangs. The monster, licking its lips in anticipation, then looked at Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grooonk!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crap, I have no choice.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated magic, a Fireball on his left hand, an Iceclad Sword on his right, and faced the Orc. If its jaws were powerful enough to crunch Horned Rabbit bones like that, they could easily tear human flesh to shreds. Reito knew he had to be very careful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief standstill, Reito took the first move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He quickly chanted a spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flame Lance!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rooork!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orc crossed its arms to protect its body from the flaming lance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beast’s upper body, however, was engulfed in flames nevertheless. For a moment, Reito thought victory was his, but then the Orc waved its arms and put out the fire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was taken aback, but the Orc did not lose time and quickly approached him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOOOORRK!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster tried to grab Reito, so he used Leap to move out of the way. The Orc fell forward because of its momentum, so Reito used his Iceclad Sword to pierce the monster from behind when it made contact with the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaahh!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ROORRK!?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood sprayed from the monster’s back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the back, however, Reito could not target the beast’s heart with precision. The Orc became furious and flung Reito off in its rampage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waaahh!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ROORK!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was thrown off the monster’s back and crashed against a tree trunk. If he hadn’t learned the Resilience and Break Fall skills, he probably would have been fatally wounded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito groaned in pain, the Orc stood up, the ice blade still stuck in its back, and tried to crush Reito’s body under its weight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOOOOAARRK!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh!! Earth Block!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly activated the basic grade magic spell Earth Block, to scoop out the ground at the Orc’s feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the monster’s legs was caught in the hole, causing it to stumble and fall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gruuah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito materialized another blade of ice and threw it at the monster’s head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Groo&#8230;orrk&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword pierced the Orc’s head and the monster gradually stopped moving completely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, breathing heavily, rejoiced for his victory.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah&#8230;I did it…!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He slowly got up and thought about the battle. How could the Orc resist the Flame Lance so easily?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to find an answer to this mystery, Reito approached the monster’s remains. Strangely enough, there was no sign of burns on its body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then called Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airun?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I’ll have you know I am becoming quite displeased with your refusal to address me properly. What is it?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I used fire magic on the Orc, but it didn’t even flinch and wasn’t burned even a little. Why?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, Orc fur is very resistant to fire magic. You should skin it and take the fur with you, don’t you think? It will protect you from most flames and can also function as armor. It is rather weak against lightning, so be careful. Oh, one more thing, Orc meat is poisonous, so you better watch out. Cooking it without the skill can be very dangerous.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s poisonous&#8230;but edible? It’s kind of surprising.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Of course it’s edible. It’s a favorite of all carnivorous monsters as the taste is really good. It’s very fatty though, so I wouldn’t recommend it to a lady.』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-53514166' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-53514166' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yeah, I didn’t ask about all that.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with a slightly cold tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then used the Dismantle skill to skin the Orc but gave up on other monster parts. Its fangs and claws were very dirty, its teeth riddled with cavities. In the end, he took only the fur and returned to the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his way back, Reito reviewed his battle against the Orc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I used Earth Block for the first time, but it worked better than expected. It was shocking to see Flame Lance brushed off like that, though&#8230;I guess I need more firepower.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled what Airis told him about the monsters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orcs were definitely more powerful than Goblins. Airis, however, said that Orcs were not especially dangerous for any small group of adventurers to defeat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were surely many monsters out there more powerful than the ones in the forest: as he was right now, it might be impossible for Reito to survive by himself in the forest. With this realization, he spoke his new resolve out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to make my magic stronger. But to do that, is raising proficiency level the only way?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito opened the status menu and checked the proficiency level of his basic grade magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>[Battle Arts]</b></p><p><b>Fireball&nbsp; </b> <b> [Proficiency Level 3]</b></p><p><b>Ice Block</b> <b> [Proficiency Level 4]</b></p><p><b>Wind Pressure [Proficiency Level 3]</b></p><p><b>Earth Block&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Proficiency Level 2]</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ice Block, which he used regularly, had the highest proficiency level. Earth Block, on the other hand, was still level 2: it was the spell he had the least chances to use, after all. He practiced all spells every day, however, so there wasn’t much difference in frequency. The reason why Earth Block had the lowest proficiency was that he had a poor affinity with the Earth element, or so Reito thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then started thinking about how to use magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, I shouldn’t think of just increasing firepower, but also have more ways to attack&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hemming and hawing, Reito created a Fireball from his palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was now capable of creating Fireballs over one meter in size, but he might inadvertently cause a forest fire, so he kept the size smaller.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder if there’s a way to increase offensive power without increasing the size&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried changing the Fireball to various shapes while mumbling to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, an idea flashed in his head: why not try using Magic Boost?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to the medicinal herbs, I could raise its proficiency to the max, but I never actually used it&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried activating Magic Boost on the Fireball.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The color of the flame globe changed, from orange to a bright red.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, the color changed?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the Fireball more closely and felt a warmth on his palm, which he never felt before: unable to resist it any longer, he made the Fireball float in midair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch! What the…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was surprised but continued to observe the Fireball. He concluded that its firepower had to be higher than before and tried using it to create Flame Lance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, activate Wind Pressure&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Reito was activating the spell, a silhouette appeared from a nearby tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRRROWL!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately turned towards the source of the growl.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There he found a sort of half-human, half-wolf creature. It had a wolf’s head and a body covered in fur, but it stood on two legs like a human. The monster stared at Reito, drool trickling from the edge of its mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Kobold: like the Orc, this monster too often appeared in fantasy works on Earth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t as huge as an Orc, but clearly bigger than the average Goblin. The fangs peeking from behind its lips seemed as sharp as blades.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried to get away, but the monster attacked him faster than he could escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kobold opened its jaws wide and tried biting Reito, but the boy managed to dodge. The monster’s mouth slammed shut, producing a sound of clashing metal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After missing the first attack, the Kobold relentlessly continued trying to bite Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAH!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crap!! Iceclad Sword..!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated his Iceclad Sword, but the Kobold’s fangs easily shattered it. His weapon destroyed, Reito activated several Fireballs to shoot the monster with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eat this!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graah…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fireball barrage struck the Kobold’s body, which started burning. Just like the Orc did, however, a swing from the monster’s arms wiped away the flames.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-45805606' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-45805606' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crap, what can I do…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito fervently looked at his surroundings and found the Fireball he had previously powered up with Magic Boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“See if you can handle this!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was quickly running out of options: he tried throwing the bright red Fireball at the Kobold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAA—!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant the Fireball struck, bright red flames spread as if exploding, enveloping the Kobold’s entire body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster quickly became charred black and dropped to the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whisper escaped Reito’s lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-wow….!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fireball was much more powerful than normal ones. Reito thus learned that basic grade magic spells could be boosted to have higher offensive power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s that strong even without fusing it with Wind Pressure&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, thoroughly impressed, gazed at the Kobold’s motionless body.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, excited by the discovery of the possibilities of using Magic Boost to reinforce basic grade magic spells, decided to sneak out to the forest during the day to practice magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, he practiced with the sword during the day. That day he was eager to practice magic, so he lied to the servants about being sick and pleaded not to let anyone inside his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he was alone, he headed to the forest. Thanks to the Tech Skill Stealth, it was easy for him to go out of the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then entered the forest and eventually found a beautiful spring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy wiped his sweat and whispered to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;I should be far enough now.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spring was in a place Reito had recently discovered, where a tall tree also grew. The spring’s water was crystal clear: you could see even from afar that a great quantity of fish swam in it. Some of the fish looked far from normal&#8230;but Reito chose not to think about it and focused on his magic training.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball, plus Magic Boost!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the day before, Reito created a Fireball from his palm, made it float in midair, and reinforced it with Magic Boost. After the Fireball changed to a bright red color, he activated Wind Pressure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind Pressure!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the wind spell fused with the Fireball, what appeared was not a flaming lance like before, but a rounder, swollen bullet-like object. The flame bullet moved away from Reito’s hand with great momentum, which built faster and faster until it crashed against a boulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact caused a loud booming sound and shattered the boulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results greatly exceeded Reito’s expectations: cold sweat broke out on the boy’s forehead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was amazing&#8230;oh, a new Craft Skill!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A status window appeared before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Flame Bullet” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately checked the skill’s details.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flame Bullet was stronger than Flame Lance but consumed a lot more magic power too. It could probably damage even Orcs and other enemies resistant to fire though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried using Magic Boost on other spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is fun…! Okay, let’s try boosting Wind Pressure now. First activate Magic Boost, then&#8230;Wind Pressure!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated Magic Boost with his right hand and Wind Pressure with his left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, Wind Pressure would create a palm-sized whirlpool, which blew a gust of wind comparable to a fan&#8230;but the combination with Magic Boost created a crescent-shaped blade of wind instead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito released the wind blade, which cut through the spring’s water surface.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, that was surprising&#8230;this is pretty awesome too.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Wind Blade” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was once again surprised, as Wind Pressure was boosted beyond his expectations, and the status window appeared again before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the skill description, the crescent-shaped wind blade could cut to shreds anything it touched. Reito thus became able to create swords not only with ice but also wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Wind Pressure, he tried boosting Ice Block.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder what’s going to happen this time. Maybe the shape will change, or….Ice Block!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he did with Wind Pressure, Reito activated Magic Boost with his right hand, then Ice Boost with his left.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-98071439' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-98071439' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shiny blue ice object formed on his palm. The color was the only visible difference, but Reito felt it was colder than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball becomes hotter, so Ice Block gets colder, I guess&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried poking the ice. The surface was so cold, however, that he instinctively recoiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, it’s freezing!! I can’t handle this directly&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito frowned and made the ice disappear. A boosted Ice Block was much colder than a normal one: touching it could make his hands freeze too, so it was probably impossible to use it for Iceclad Sword. It could be used as a direct offensive, though…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that I think about it, I didn’t learn a Craft Skill after using Magic Boost on Ice Block&#8230;oh well. The last one is Earth Block.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried boosting the last of the basic grade magic spells he knew. He pressed his palm on the ground and activated Earth Block, then Magic Boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito expected to be able to manipulate a greater mass of soil, or for it to work faster&#8230;but yet again, the results exceeded his expectations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something feels funny…whoa!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt something was off with his hands and looked at them: his palms were imbued with crimson magic power and his fingers were sinking inside the hard soil. He hurriedly took them out, leaving prints on the ground. The magic power on his palms, however, was still there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What‘s going on here?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puzzled by the strange phenomenon, Reito glanced at the large tree next to the spring. On a whim, he tried touching the trunk.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not exerting power at all, his fingertips penetrated the tree bark. When he took them out, clear prints appeared on the surface.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could it be that&#8230;it’s affecting gravity around my fingers…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito himself thought it was a far-fetched theory, but it was the truth. Boosting Earth Block made it possible to control gravity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito clenched his fist and punched the tree with all his might.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaah!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fist passed through the tree trunk, leaving a hole in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, what’s this power!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t help but shout, surprised. No matter how much he trained or leveled up, a child’s fist shouldn’t be able to punch a hole in a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status window appeared before Reito’s eyes, announcing the acquisition of a new skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Battle Art “Fist Strike” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fist Strike? So with that punch, I learned a striking Battle Art&#8230;like this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito dispelled the magic power from his hands and tried punching the tree trunk again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No hole formed this time however. Without the boosted Earth Block, it wasn’t possible to produce as much power as before, apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, let’s try boosting Earth Block to the max and&#8230;Fist Strike!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito infused his fists with the crimson magic power again and punched the air. The next moment, maybe thanks to the boosted Earth Block, the status window appeared again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Heavy Strike” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overjoyed after learning another skill, Reito decided to practice a bit longer with his two new skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heavy Strike!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment he pronounced the skill’s name, Reito’s fist surged with the crimson magic power and he thrust it forward, creating a small shockwave. Reito then clenched his fist again and tried the other skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fist Strike!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fist imbued with gravity magic shot forward. The speed and offensive power of Reito’s Fist Strike was already on par with a martial artist: Reito had no way of knowing this, however, so he continued to train.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shaah! Haah! No, I can do better&#8230;like this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito subconsciously planted his feet on the ground, rotated his sole, ankle, knee, thigh joints, torso, chest, shoulder, elbow, and arm — in that order — and thrust his fist with great momentum: the resulting shockwave was massive, strong enough to cause ripples on the spring’s water surface.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, breathing heavily, felt that something clicked, like never before. Once again, the status window appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Bullet Strike” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!! Agh, ouch, ouch!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito jumped up, excited about learning another Craft Skill, but a jolt of pain ran through his body, forcing him to groan in pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hurriedly activated Recovery Boost to heal his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the pain wore off, so Reito sighed in relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;I guess I have to train my body some more. I learned many skills today, though&#8230;even Martial Artist ones&#8230;wait&#8230;I’m a&#8230;Support Magician, right…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized he learned many skills unbecoming of a magic user and cocked his head. It didn’t feel right, but he decided to go back to the residence for the time being.</span></p>
