<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Days of intensive magic training thus started for Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He activated both Muscle Boost and Recovery Boost during his daily sword swings, and when he took care of the herbs he used Magic Boost. This was all part of Reito’s daily training.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, he could only use magic 10 times a day, but after just one month, that number had climbed as high as 30 times.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the special training, however, another issue surfaced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Power Herbs tended by Reito grew at a much higher speed than the others. Aria started suspecting something was going on, so he was forced to practice Magic Boost on something other than the herbs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After testing various things, he settled on the apple tree growing in the garden. He was surprised that Magic Boost worked on what seemed like any other tree, but he practiced casting Magic Boost on the tree while pretending to nap under it, so he could continue his training without anyone noticing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if he practiced every day, the proficiency level of Support Magic increased at a very slow pace, which was another reason why Support Magician was considered a hopeless job. Reito had more than enough time on his hands, however, so he could practice to his heart’s content every day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such days of fervent training passed one after the other: eventually, Reito reached his 7th birthday.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Reito, it meant that he now had a new duty: studying.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young master! It’s time to study! We have to do writing practice today!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was playing in his room, when a very eager Aria came in, carrying a small pile of textbooks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at Aria and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you I can write already! Come on, there are other things I want to study! Like magic!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No can do, young master!! The basics are the most important thing! Even if your handwriting is better than mine, I will not allow it!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But why!? &#8230;you’ve got personal reasons, don’t you..?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Translation skill, Reito did not need to learn how to read or write. Aria did not know that, however, so she made him practice both every day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was also another reason why Aria was so passionate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito’s studies started and she wrote him a character sample to practice with, not only could he already write, but his handwriting was better than hers. Aria was so shocked that she started practicing to improve her own calligraphy, disguising it as reading and writing practice for Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was a teenager when he was reborn in this world, so his knowledge naturally surpassed a child’s level. He had also learned all sorts of things about this world from Airis, so he had little need to study. He could not exactly say that, however, so he ended up having to do as Aria said.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, after reading and writing practice a history lesson would follow. Airis had told Reito about this world’s history, but he used Aria’s lessons to confirm and complement his knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen well, young master. There are six races in this world: Humans, Elves, Beasts, Giants, Demons, and Dwarves. Do you know the differences between these races?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Humans are the most numerous race and have high intellect. Elves have especially long life spans and have powerful magic. Beasts have both human and animal-like traits. Giants have massive, sturdy bodies. Demons can have various appearances and abilities, but their intellect is on par with humans. Lastly, the Dwarves have an aggressive temperament, but many of them are skilled craftsmen. They can make special weapons like Holy Swords and Magic Swords&#8230;right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito answered without any doubt or hesitation, leaving Aria wide-eyed in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C-correct&#8230;amazing, young master! It felt like you were reading from a textbook&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it’s nothing&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just repeated word for word what Airis taught me, after all.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-28997704' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-28997704' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byIKICAgICBkYXRhLWZ1bGwtd2lkdGgtcmVzcG9uc2l2ZT0idHJ1ZSI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt a bit guilty for tricking Aria, then looked at one of the books she brought, which detailed the kingdom’s history.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kingdom of Bartros had a history of circa 300 years: it was the largest country in the world and was ruled by Humans. The other races that governed countries were only the Beasts, the Giants, and the Dwarves: Elves and Demons did not found their own state.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito knew that there were violent conflicts among the six races in the past, but he learned from the textbook that one of the past Bartros kings brought an end to such wars and made the six races sign a treaty.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said it to Aria and she leaned forward, excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The blood of a legendary king runs in your veins, young master! You must remember not to bring shame to such a legacy!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if the ancestors were legends, it doesn’t mean the descendants are too. Besides, I’m not even allowed to consider myself a member of the royal family&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah&#8230;I’m sorry&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria realized her blunder and hurriedly apologized, then her expression clouded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not care about not being allowed to say he was a royal or about his father’s lack of love: he was more worried about the fact that his words made Aria sad.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to change the topic, he asked her a question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, Aria, can you use basic grade magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basic grade magic? Do you mean lifestyle magic? Yes, of course. I’m not very good at magic other than Spirit Magic, though&#8230;wait? How do you know about basic grade magic, young master…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly made up an excuse to sway Aria’s suspicion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I just read a picture book where the main character used it! Can you please show it to me? I really want to see what kind of magic it actually is&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, I have the feeling there’s something you’re not telling me here&#8230;oh, fine, it’s not dangerous anyway. Lifestyle magic is something you can use without the risk of causing trouble.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria usually refused to show Reito any kind of magic, but basic grade magic was apparently an exception, thanks to not being dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria lightly rotated her shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, let’s take a little break from studying, I’ll show you basic grade magic. Watch well&#8230;if you have enough affinity, you might be able to use it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Affinity&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let me explain in easy terms. You see, magic is&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria’s explanation could be summarized as follows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, magic could be mainly categorized into seven elements: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Lightning, Holy, and Dark. Affinity to the seven elements was more or less decided by one’s race and job: Humans were proficient in Fire magic, Elves in Wind magic, and so forth. Water magic was a specialty of the creatures called “Merfolk”, while Dwarves excelled in Earth magic. Very few individuals, of any race, specialized in Lightning magic, while many Beasts had a great affinity with Holy magic. Lastly, those with the Necromancer job often favored Dark magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than the seven basic elements, there were also higher grade ones, such as the Storm and Flame element, but individuals capable of using them were extremely rare.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria, being an Elf, had a high affinity with the Wind element, but it did not mean she could not use other elements: in fact, she knew Water and Earth elemental spells too. Elves, however, had a notoriously bad affinity with the Fire element, and she was no exception: she could not use any Fire spells. Only Dark Elves, a subspecies of the Elven race, could use Fire elemental spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basic grade magic, also called lifestyle magic, consists in spells with low offensive power. If you practice using them you can raise their proficiency level, but I have never heard of anyone actually using it as offensive magic in battle.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really&#8230;so, what kind of magic is it?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t expect too much&#8230;allow me to show you, then! Final attack, Wind Pressure!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria raised her right hand and chanted a spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the wind started whirling on her palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTU4OTQyMzMwNjIiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was showier than Reito expected, so he couldn’t help but react loudly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria thrust her palm forward and the wind swirling on her hand shot towards Reito.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20536" src="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" srcset="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid-204x300.jpg 204w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid-660x969.jpg 660w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid-66x96.jpg 66w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/AriaMaid.jpg 1009w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt the wind on his face and instinctively braced for impact — but the mildly strong gust simply swept past him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cocked his head to the side, perplexed, as Aria turned off the wind and wiped the sweat off her forehead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;this uses up magic power, so that’s all for now.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s it!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reacted with loud surprise, but Aria replied calmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you to keep your expectations low! Honestly&#8230;anyway, this is basic grade magic.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could not hide his disappointment: it was much more underwhelming than he anticipated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria’s wind pressure basic grade magic had very low offensive power&#8230;if it had any at all. There was no way to use it in battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other basic grade magic spells are even more pitiful, you know. Do you want to see them all the same?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, just in case&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will show you the water spell next, then&#8230;Ice Block!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria clasped her palms together and focused: a baseball-sized sphere of ice formed from her hands, spreading cold air in the surroundings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s excitement grew, but Aria suddenly released her hands and staggered a bit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah&#8230;I just can’t pull it off&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? What do you mean?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria held her hands in apology.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry, young master, that seems to be my limit. I did my best, but I cannot handle elements other than Wind well&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, someone good at using those elements can make it look more impressive, right? How does that spell really turn out?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s question contained a glimmer of hope, which was flatly dashed by Aria’s answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? It makes ice, that’s it. Well, objects created through magic vanish quickly, so it won’t last long though.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the point in making it…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can cool your body on a hot day. If you use magic for that, though, you’d start sweating even more&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no point then. What about Earth magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please wait a moment&#8230;oh yes, let’s use that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria pointed at a plant vase in the corner of the room. She brought it closer and pointed her palm at the soil inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Watch well, young master. Earth Block!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria chanted another spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast with her enthusiastic incantation, however, the plant vase was apparently unfazed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;nothing happened…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh no, you must look closer!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria excitedly pointed at the soil inside the vase.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you see? The soil increased a little here!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lame!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, triggered by the utter insignificance of the spell’s scale, couldn’t help but react harshly. Aria was a bit shaken by his momentum but explained more in detail about Earth Block.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s more useful than Ice Block, though. You can use it to send nutrients to the soil, so it can help create an environment where plants grow more.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it’s really surprisingly useful!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s also one of the reasons why basic grade magic is called lifestyle magic. If you raise the proficiency level, you can manipulate soil with it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria paused for a moment, then seemed to recall something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that I think about it, we never checked your elemental affinities, did we, young master? It’s too expensive to do it with an Appraisal Tome, so I’ll use a simple method. Can you try doing what I just did?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did you just do? You mean basic grade magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria nodded to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Humans are generally good at Fire magic, but sometimes they also have Wind affinity. Please try to activate the Wind Pressure spell I did first.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito imitated the way Aria held her hands and chanted the spell’s name.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Wind Pressure!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That very instant, a whirlpool of wind, far larger than the one Aria produced, rose from Reito’s palms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was surprised to successfully activate the spell so easily, but recalled Aria’s motions and pushed his palm forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whirlpool then unleashed a powerful gust of wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hurriedly waved his hands to cancel the wind, but all books and papers in the room were scattered everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey!? What was that power? How can it be stronger than my Wind Pressure…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria was naturally surprised: on the other hand, Reito was completely taken aback.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was shocking&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status window appeared before Reito’s eyes.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-97678787' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-97678787' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Battle Art “Wind Pressure” acquired.&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, I learned it just like that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito checked his status and realized that he had also learned Ice Block and Earth Block, even if he just watched Aria use them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was thus revealed that Reito had an affinity to three magic elements.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria, wide-eyed, finally managed to open her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway&#8230;it’s unbelievable&#8230;to be able to cast basic grade magic with such power&#8230;young master, could it be that you’re a genius?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it was just a fluke&#8230;anyway, I wonder if I can learn other basic grade magic spells too. Is there anyone else who can use basic grade magic in the residence?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, the mistress can use Fire magic&#8230;but it’s more dangerous than other elements, so I don’t know if she will agree to teach you.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see. Okay, I’ll ask mom!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately scampered out of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, young master! What about studying&#8230;gwah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria hurriedly chased after Reito, but her feet were caught in the textbooks strewn on the floor, sending her face flat on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took advantage of the opportunity to activate Muscle Boost and Recovery Boost, then used Leap to move quickly through the corridor. In the blink of an eye, he arrived at his mother Aira’s room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Reito. Did you run away from the textbooks? Hehe.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito suddenly barged into the room and Aira smiled at him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She often hid Reito when he was on the run from the servants, so she thought he had escaped Aria’s lesson and sought shelter in her room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately approached the main topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mother, can you use the Fire spell of basic grade magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basic grade magic? Yes, of course I can, but&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you please show it to me?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aira was a bit confused by Reito’s sudden strange request but thought he had to have his reasons and nodded. She pointed her palm upwards and chanted the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Fireball.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flaming sphere appeared on Aira’s palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then manipulated it, making it fly all around the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at Aira’s control of the spell, then tried imitating her. He pointed his palm upwards, as she did, and chanted the spell’s name.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The globe of fire formed on his palm, all too easily.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, you can use it too!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aira was impressed by Reito successfully casting the spell on his first try, but quickly noticed the abnormality of his Fireball.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its size was about two times larger than Aira’s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried moving the Fireball. Slowly but surely, it started floating around him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, it’s pretty hard to make it move&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes&#8230;that’s right&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aira looked at Reito manipulated the Fireball with utter shock.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had taken her about one month of practice before she could control the Fireball at will. Reito, however, had learned how to cast the spell and control it — all in one day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was too focused on practicing the spell to notice his mother’s reaction. After a little while, he could already control the Fireball perfectly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a bit more exercise, Reito reduced the size of the Fireball and put it out by clasping his hands together. He then looked at Aira with a bright smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This spell seems really convenient. You can use it for cooking and other things&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-right&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I should go now. Thank you very much, mother!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Aira could say anything, Reito ran out of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now alone in her room, Aira was still dumbfounded. She was moved by learning that her son possessed a natural talent for magic, of course.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such a joy grew within her, however, she recalled his particular situation and her expression stiffened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be able to control magic so well at his age&#8230;if only he wasn’t born a Support Magician, he could have become king&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was already too far for his mother’s laments to reach his ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he had heard her words, he would surely be hurt — as even his own mother pitied him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving his mother’s room, Reito did not return to his room to study with Aria but decided to go practice magic by himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he did it in the rear garden or other open spaces he would be found in no time, so he decided to go on the roof.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After drawing this conclusion, Reito immediately went to the garret and climbed the ladder onto the roof. He looked around to make sure no one could see him, then started chanting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball&#8230;yeah, I can use this easily already&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created a fireball on his fingertip and made sure he could manipulate it at will. He couldn’t move it as quickly as Aira did, but felt that he would become able to control it nimbly with more practice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, a new idea flashed in his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder if you can create two Fireballs at once?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He tried focusing on this concept and a Fireball appeared in each of his hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made the Fireballs float in midair before him, then tried creating more: there were now a total of four.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-20483282' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-20483282' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSczJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI2MTA1NjkzNDA2Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all went rather smoothly until now, but no matter how much he concentrated, he couldn’t create a fifth Fireball.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, so my limit is four. But if I raise the proficiency level, I bet I can make more.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put out the four Fireballs for the time being.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then started practicing the other magic spells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I used Wind Pressure already, so let’s try Ice Block and Earth Block, since I only learned them. Earth Block doesn’t look like it could be useful in battle&#8230;no, wait. I could dig pitfalls or use the earth to block enemy attacks. That could be pretty useful.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito wanted to try Earth Block first but then realized that there was no soil to be found on the roof. He felt kind of disappointed at himself, then switched to the Ice Block spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice Block!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He focused magic power on his palm and a block of ice appeared on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ice Block Aria created was more or less the size of a baseball, but Reito’s was easily double its size.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then tried manipulating it, as he did with Fireball.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t work as well, however. Compared to fire, ice was much more difficult to move freely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can move it somehow, but it’s pretty hard to control&#8230;it doesn’t work like Fireball, huh. Why does Water magic create ice, anyway?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided to call on Airis to answer his questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She promptly responded and started explaining.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Only merfolk can create water via Water magic: if any other species uses it, they can only create cold air or blocks of ice. That’s why you can’t create water either, Reito.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;by the way, can you become immortal if you eat a mermaid’s flesh?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Absolutely not. You’re confusing them with myths from your world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s doubt was dispelled, so he thanked Airis and cut the communication.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then continued practicing the control of ice created through the Ice Block spell. There was not much improvement, however: he couldn’t control ice as well as fire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to Fireball, he needed more concentration and used up more magic power when casting Ice Block. He couldn’t make multiple blocks either. He might become more skilled if the proficiency level rose, but at the moment it would be difficult to use it offensively.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In any case, I’ve got to practice a lot more.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Reito whispered to himself, then realized something peculiar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, yeah, when I fell from the roof, Aria used Wind magic to save me, right? So maybe Wind Pressure can soften the impact of landing&#8230;okay, let’s try!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked down at the ground and jumped off the roof, with eager momentum. If his mother or Aria saw him, they would surely lose their minds.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before he crashed on the ground, Reito activated Wind Pressure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind Pressure! Whoops!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong wind spun on his palm. He used it as a cushion, successfully erasing the momentum of his fall, and landed without a scratch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It worked! I can use this whenever I need to go down from high places. Okay then, since I could jump down here, I might as well practice Earth Block.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then headed towards the flower patch in the rear garden, while paying attention not to let Aria find him. As soon as he arrived at his destination, he touched the soil in the flower patch and chanted the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really hope this magic isn’t only to cultivate the fields&#8230;Earth Block!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ripple traveled over the soil, with Reito’s hand as the center. The ground had swelled, responding to his chant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, awesome&#8230;but it sure is exhausting too!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Earth magic spell consumed much more magic power than other basic grade magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, a pained grimace on his face, tried to keep the spell active, but could only endure for a few more seconds before giving up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah&#8230;hah&#8230;I thought it would be useful to cultivate the field with magic, but it’s easier to do it manually&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earth Block’s sole usage seemed to be giving nutrition to the soil. Reito reached this conclusion and decided not to try using it in battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he restored the patch to its former state, he recalled something Aria told him once.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;oh yeah, elemental magic has affinities, right…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Fire magic was canceled by Water magic — elements had a good or bad affinity with each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought that combining together elements that did not have bad affinity could maybe create more powerful magic, so he immediately put it to the test.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He created a Fireball from his palm and made it float in place, then activated Wind Pressure with the other palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Point Wind Pressure at the Fireball and&#8230;whoa!?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Wind Pressure formed, the spiraling wind was sucked in by Fireball.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fireball changed to a lance-like shape and flew off. The flaming lance proceeded straight at incredible speed, then vanished after a flight of about five meters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what was that…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trembling Reito saw the usual status window appear before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Flame Lance” acquired.&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately checked the details: the Craft Skills list now showed a new offensive spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>[Craft Skills]</b></p><p><b>Flame Lance — Fire/Wind compound magic spell</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill’s description stated it was a compound magic spell — a term Reito never heard before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if you combine different magic elements, you get compound spells&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought about the Flame Lance he had created.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The range wasn’t very long, but it definitely had more offensive power than a normal Fireball. Awesome&#8230;there’s nothing ‘lifestyle’ about this magic, anyway. You can definitely use it in battle!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning that lifestyle magic could be combined in battle-oriented spells, Reito became a bit excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same moment, his head suddenly jolted with pain, forcing him on one knee.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-53268445' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-53268445' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-wha…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s body staggered and wobbled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could hear Aria’s voice calling him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here you are, young mas&#8230;ter!? What happened!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria noticed Reito was not acting normally and ran up to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He tried telling her he was all right, but his voice wouldn’t come out. Soon enough, he lost consciousness.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few hours later, when Reito woke up again, he was lying on his bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A water pail and a towel were placed on the table next to the bed. Reito, thinking that Aria probably carried him here, tried to sit up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His head, however, was struck by another flash of dull pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch&#8230;head hurts&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito pressed his temples and grimaced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to understand what happened to him, he opened communication with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Aisman』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, I am a primitive human being frozen in ice now&#8230;do you really want to see me angry?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito let Airis’ comment go without reacting and asked her about what happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Of course not, ma’am&#8230;more importantly, can you tell me what happened to me?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, yes. The reason why you collapsed is simple: you used too much magic power. You’ve had headaches before after using magic, didn’t you?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yeah, I think I did&#8230;but I never lost consciousness before.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito practiced magic every day after learning his first Support magic spells, in order to raise their proficiency level, and had indeed experienced light headaches.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ explanation continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You were so excited after learning basic grade magic that you didn’t notice how much magic power you consumed, I suppose. So you used it to the limit and lost consciousness. Even if basic grade magic doesn’t consume much magic power, you shouldn’t push yourself so hard.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;yeah, I did lots of experimenting&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito seemed to regret his mistakes, so Airis continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『But I was impressed that you could make a compound spell with basic grade magic. If you raise its proficiency level, you might even be able to make it as powerful as a Blast magic spell.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really!? Great, I have to practice a lot!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please use compound spells sparingly, though. You are still immature&#8230;I mean, your body hasn’t grown enough yet. In any case, compound spells consume a great quantity of magic power. It is very dangerous to use them frequently while you are still growing.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So I have to wait until I get bigger?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis paused for a moment after Reito’s complaints, then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;if you have to practice no matter what, you should expand your magic power capacity first. If you fight monsters and level up, your magic power will increase&#8230;but there’s a quicker method. You have SP, don’t you?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『SP? Oh, you mean this?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito opened his status window: the characters “SP” were displayed on it in a large font.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to it, the number 1 was displayed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『SP stands for Skill Points. You can use them to learn new skills or raise the proficiency of skills you have already acquired. You can only gain SP by leveling up, by the way. Once you’ve used them, they never come back, but be very careful.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ooh&#8230;eh? Why didn’t you tell me about something so convenient until now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis answered Reito’s question with a mischievous tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『If you knew that you learn skills with SP, you would have stopped making efforts to learn them, wouldn’t you? If you stop trying to learn skills the usual way, thinking that you can just use SP, then it’s all over, you know?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay, I get your point&#8230;so why tell me about it now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I simply judged it appropriate to tell you at this point. Moreover, there is a skill I think you should learn now, to help your future growth. Unfortunately, there are abilities that you cannot learn, no matter how much effort you pour into it.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis had something in mind, apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thus decided to use his SP to learn a new skill. He thought about using his SP and the status window showed a “List of Learnable Skills”. The screen showed a long list of skills Reito hadn’t learned yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Whoa, there’s so many&#8230;which one should I learn?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The Unique Skill called “Magic Power Recovery Speed Up”. As the name says, this skill lets you recover magic power faster, so it is perfect for your current situation.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Wow, this “Oriental Fang” Battle Art seems cool&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Sir Reito? Are you listening? That skill is only for Beasts, you can’t learn it anyway.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Tch&#8230;okay then, this is it, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half pouting, Reito mentally expressed the desire to learn Magic Power Recovery Speed Up. His SP was consumed and the skill was acquired.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic Power Recovery Speed Up was Reito’s first Unique Skill. The skills in this category were always active, so once they were acquired their bonuses were always present.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis spoke up again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『This skill will lessen the burden on your body when you use magic. When you level up you will gain more SP and will be able to learn new skills, so please let me know.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay. Thanks for everything.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’re very welcome. Well then, my tea time is approaching, so if you will excuse me&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis then closed the communication.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time started moving again and Reito realized his headache was completely gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill he just learned apparently activated immediately, refilling his magic power quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This skill is really something&#8230;but I guess I’m going to be training all day from now on&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito lay back down on his bed, thinking of ways to reduce studying time in order to train.</span></p>
