<h3>Chapter 12</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years had passed since Reito started living in the cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He raised Ullr as a hunting dog to hunt down monsters in the forest every day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, Reito and Ullr’s target was a Poark, a boar-like monster with meat even more delicious than Horned Rabbits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr had grown in size, but the Poark was still almost twice as large as him. Even so, the White Wolf chased its prey without fear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOOAR!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OHEEERRK!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Poark fled desperately, its cry vaguely resembling an Orc’s.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poarks had massive bodies, but their disposition was rather meek. On the other hand, they were even more powerful than Orcs: they could even take down large trees when they charged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chaser, Ullr, however, was even stronger. He ran as fast as a bullet and attacked with sharp fangs and claws.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grawr!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hoeerk!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s claws slashed the poor beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was observing the situation from atop a tree branch. He carefully aimed at the Poark, bow and arrow in hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;there!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HOGAAARRRK!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrow struck the Poark, exactly between the eyes. The monster’s massive body collapsed and quickly stopped moving.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito jumped down from the tree and Ullr immediately ran up to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good job, Ullr.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Praised by his master, Ullr happily wagged its tail left and right.</span></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20675" src="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" srcset="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr-204x300.jpg 204w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr-660x969.jpg 660w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr-66x96.jpg 66w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ReitoAndUllr.jpg 1009w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gave Ullr a pleasant rub.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been living in the forest for a long time, but had not gone to the human settlements outside of the forest yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason was that Airis told him he should not go.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, Reito’s wanted poster had been distributed in all the nearby villages and towns. The kingdom had classified him as a criminal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news of his escape from the residence had reached the capital, naturally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king, fearing Reito’s escape across the border, apparently sent his wanted poster to all cities and towns within its territory.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His crime was treason: a large bounty now hung on his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No child could ever survive in that forest, normally, but evidently the king thought otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was thus forced to live in the forest, unable to even visit human dwellings. Two years had passed, but the state of alert around him had not changed in the slightest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito called Ullr, while butchering the Poark.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll have Poark hot pot tonight. Honestly, the Cooking skill sure is convenient!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-95188124' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-95188124' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living in the forest, Reito eventually acquired the long-awaited Cooking skill.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to it, not only did he become good at cooking, but he also became able to prepare simple seasonings with wild herbs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last two years, Reito also became skilled with bow and arrow. He had made both out of wood, while he used Shape Change on metal he brought from the residence to make the arrowheads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He learned many other useful skills too, such as Concoction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was still working on the Poark, when the noise of distant thunder reached his ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh&#8230;sounds like it’s going to rain. Better finish quickly.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stand guard, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr nodded to Reito and started patrolling the surroundings. Thanks to him, Reito could focus on the monster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was done, Reito took the parts he couldn’t use as materials or ingredients and covered them in soil.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Done. I’ll leave this here for other monsters.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr did not seem to agree with Reito’s plan, however.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t complain, it’s not good to be greedy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gently scolded Ullr, who promptly obeyed. Living together in the forest, they came to understand each other better and better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the hunt, Reito went back to his “home”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo’s return to the cave behind the waterfall was uneventful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gave some smoked Horned Rabbit meat to Ullr, while he had grilled fish and soup made with vegetables and Orc meat. The vegetables in this world were fairly similar to the ones on Earth, but the main sources of meat were monsters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito savored the soup, but thinking about his past world’s food made him sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If only I had some miso, I could make it into soup&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew it was an absurd desire, but couldn’t help but long for it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stopped eating for a moment and turned towards Ullr. The white wolf had finished eating and lied down to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took a blanket and put it over Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good boy&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito patted Ullr’s head, careful not to wake him up, then returned to his meal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that precise moment, however, Reito’s Detect Presence picked up something. Someone was approaching the entrance of the cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, as silently as possible, picked up the bow and arrow laid against the wall. He activated Soundless Walk and moved towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked outside the cave — and found a Goblin. It was carrying fruit, for some reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghee!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTI1MDM1NTEwNTQiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recognized the Goblin and his expression softened. He put down the bow and arrow and approached the monster, without any fear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin offered the fruit to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghee!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today we have Rico and Min fruit&#8230;okay, here’s your raw Orc meat.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeh!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took the fruit from the Goblin and gave it raw meat in exchange. The Goblin took it and left, humming gleefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and the Goblin formed such a “relationship” roughly one year before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, while exploring the forest, Reito spotted a Goblin being attacked by an Orc.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had no interest in saving monsters, but more Orc meat was always welcome, so he took down the pig-like beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus as a result, he saved the Goblin’s life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin ran off after that, but appeared again while Reito and Ullr were out hunting the next day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster, carrying as much fruit as its arms could hold, offered it all to Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Does it want me to have it?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was puzzled for a moment, but felt no hostility from the Goblin, so he decided to take the fruit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, the Goblin would appear before Reito every now and then, always bringing fruit. Eventually, Reito stopped just accepting the offering and started giving leftover monster meat in exchange.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that I think about it, I don’t see any Goblins other than that guy around here&#8230;I wonder what’s going on?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito spoke his thoughts out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some thought, he recalled the circumstances in which he first encountered the Goblin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, could it be that it strayed from the pack for some reason? So it started living in this area by itself&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reached this conclusion because the Goblin’s offerings never included monster meat. It always brought fruits and herbs for Reito, maybe to have monster meat in exchange, since it couldn’t hunt monsters on its own.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, Reito started worrying about the Goblin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After I leave this place&#8230;will that guy be fine on its own&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, you were up?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr had come next to Reito, without him realizing it. He looked at the Goblin gleefully prance away, its arms filled with monster meat. The boy and the White Wolf watched the monster until it disappeared from their sight.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days later…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr were going back to the cave after the usual hunting, but the cave seemed different than usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fruit was scattered around the entrance. The furniture, tools, and food storage had been ravaged too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was so surprised that he dropped the monster game on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happened!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grooowl…”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to the shocked Reito, Ullr was baring his fangs, as if in excitement, then started sniffing around the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito picked up the fruit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure we ate all the fruit we had before leaving&#8230;so this is new stuff! That Goblin brought it here? It definitely doesn’t look like this was done by people, it has to be monsters’ doing&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was trying to make sense of the situation, when Ullr barked to draw his attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;you found the smell of the monster which made a mess of the cave!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr nodded to Reito’s question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Wolf started following the monster’s tracks, its nose on the ground. Reito quickly made the necessary preparations and followed his hound.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr exited the cave and headed into the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This way?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr started running at full speed, following the smell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated his Swift Legs skill and used the Physical Boost support magic too, so he could keep up with Ullr’s speed without problems.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graawr!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happened?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr stopped abruptly and growled in front of a large tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked in the direction of the tree and saw a large bear-like creature with red fur, about 3 metres tall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAAAARRR!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, it’s huge!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Groooowl….”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing the dark red bear-like beast, Reito and Ullr retreated a few steps.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Observing Eye Tech Skill and realized that the monster’s fur was not normally that color.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the dark red was caused by blood. The surroundings were indeed filled with its stench.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blood red bear yawned loudly, then glared at Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy clicked his tongue and quickly opened communication with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis apparently expected Reito to call, as she answered promptly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is a Blood Bear, commonly called just “Red Bear”, a level 3 monster.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Level?

For monsters, it defines their danger level, and goes from 1 to 5.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis paused for a moment, then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Goblins, which can be defeated by the average person, are level 1. Monsters like Orcs, a common prey of beginner adventurers, are level 2. Monsters that only expert adventurers can consistently defeat are level 3. Those which only the handful of S rank adventurers can face are level 4. Lastly, dragons and other mythical monsters are level 5. It is said that a whole army is needed to exterminate one of those monsters.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito timidly asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So this monster is&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, a level 3. As such, it is super strong. Definitely a tough opponent for you now, Reito. If you don’t strike first, you will be killed.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『For real? This is bad.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed after hearing Airis’ assessment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He closed the communication and time started flowing again. Reito immediately armed himself with his bow and shot an arrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWARR!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrow flew straight towards the Blood Bear’s head, exactly as Reito aimed, but the monster stopped it with its fangs and crushed it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then switched to the next offensive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He created ice swords with both hands and made the blades vibrate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proficiency level of Reito’s Ice Block was already maxed out at 5: the ice’s hardness was much greater than before, and the number of blocks he could create at the same time increased too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created a gigantic block of ice in midair, then activated the Craft Skill he learned when he maxed out the proficiency of Ice Block.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice Blade Bullet!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blade of ice shot towards the bear monster, as fast as a gunshot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword pierced its thick skin and stabbed its flesh, propelling the monster backwards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaaaagh….!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severely wounded, the Blood Bear fell to its knees.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then gave an order to Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good! Ullr, bite!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr immediately followed orders and jumped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It spun its body in midair, lunging for the bear monster’s neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s razor sharp fangs sank into the Blood Bear’s flesh, spraying blood everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHHH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did it!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awooooo!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blood Bear, its figure now more than ever befitting its name, collapsed on the ground. Reito and Ullr cheered, but the next instant realized something unusual was going on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRRAAAAHH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roar of the supposedly defeated Blood Bear echoed throughout the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt that the trees near him were shaking: he turned around and found another Blood Bear. It was even larger than the one they just defeated, easily over 5 meters in size.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what!? There’s another one!?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive Blood Bear knocked down the surrounding trees and stood tall. Its imposing bulk froze Reito and Ullr in their tracks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newcomer glanced at its brethren, sprawled motionless on the ground, and roared furiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAAAARRRRR!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is really bad!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr detected the danger and jumped backwards: at the same time, the Blood Bear slammed its claws on the ground, causing a tremor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito saw fragments of the soil fly everywhere and was blown away himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What insane power!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn’t help but be shocked by the sheer strength of a single attack by the monster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr jumped on a tree branch, then charged towards the monster’s neck. It tried ripping its flesh like before, but its fangs could not penetrate the Blood Bear’s thick skin this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The massive beast glared at Ullr, then swatted him away, sending the White Wolf flying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yiiip!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr! Damn you…Ice Blade Bullet!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRUAAAHHHH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created another large blade of ice and shot it at the monster, but the beast’s claws repelled it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal magic couldn’t damage it, apparently. Reito thus decided to use a composite spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball&#8230;into Flame Lance!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaah…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito launched a Flame Lance from his palm, piercing the bear monster’s arm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His magic had grown to a point that he could even burn a fire-resistant Orc to cinders. The giant Blood Bear, however, simply swung its arms to wipe out the flames.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster then roared its irritation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAHH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito jumped backwards to dodge the Blood Bear’s swing, then continued to evade its following attacks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whops — tch — crap — that — was — close!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graah…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bear monster seemed to be confused by Reito’s evasion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Reito was growing tense. He could dodge the Blood Bear’s attacks thanks to the Martial Artist Tech Skill “Evasion”. If he hadn’t learned it, he would surely be dead already.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took advantage of the pause in the Blood Bear’s offensive and pointed his palm at the ground, to activate Earth Block.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earth Block!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-77955539' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-77955539' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant bear monster’s hind legs sank into the soil, knocking it down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then activated another Craft Skill he learned when he maxed out the proficiency of Fire basic grade magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great Fireball!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Fireball ten times larger than the regular one formed from his palm. Reito immediately slammed it on the Blood Bear’s back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment it made contact with the monster, the Fireball turned into a flame pillar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRUAAAHHHH!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blood Bear, its back scorched by flames, wailed in pain. Reito’s offensive continued, to deliver the final blow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fireball&#8230;into Wind Blade!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He created another Fireball with his left palm, then activated Magic Boost and, at the same time, the boosted Wind Pressure spell — Wind Blade with his right palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crescent blade of wind was thus absorbed by the Fireball, turning into a blade of flames, which Reito unleashed on the monster’s face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAAAHHH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, feeling his attack struck loud and clear, rejoiced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blood Bear thrashed about, but its lower body was still stuck in the ground, so its claws could not reach Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Reito was sure of his victory, another roar shook the air from behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned around and found yet another Blood Bear, gripping fish with both paws.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly activated the Observing Eye skill and found out that this bear was the mother of the first one he killed. The bear Reito just set ablaze was the father, apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Blood Bear was smaller in size than the others, but for Reito it was still massive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother bear, realizing Reito had attacked her family, charged at him furiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAHH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So fast!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito barely managed to avoid the attack thanks to Evasion, but the mother bear’s offensive was relentless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster knocked down one of the nearby trees and used the trunk in a sweeping attack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly activated Leap, jumping from branch to branch to avoid the mother bear’s attacks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meanwhile, the Blood bear scorched by flames stood back up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaaahhhh….”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two Blood Bears’ rumbling roars echoed through the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized the situation had become really desperate and contacted Airis to look for ways to survive the crisis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, quite the pinch, isn’t it. I cannot see your future, so be very careful. Anyway, about the two Blood Bears&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I used too much magic today already, but I can’t let this fight go on much longer&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Composite magic consumes a lot of magic power, after all. Why don’t you try the sword skills you’re so good at then?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Will a sword work against huge monsters like those?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ reply to Reito’s question sounded like a riddle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Not a normal sword, of course. So use one that is not normal.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;okay.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed internally at Airis’ reply and closed the communication. Time started flowing again and Reito jumped down on the ground, facing the two Blood Bears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrraaahhh&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two monsters, wary of Reito, kept their distance. Reito used the opportunity to approach the collapsed Ullr and cast the Support magic spell Recovery Boost on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can do it, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woo&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Recovery Boost Ullr regained consciousness and slowly stood back up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, the impact when he was tossed by the bear monster only made him faint: he did not have any serious wounds.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr was still eager to fight: he bared his fangs at the Blood Bears and growled menacingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrrrrrowl!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then ordered him to create a diversion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Calm down now&#8230;I want you to run around and draw their attention. I’ll find an opening and finish them off.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr, brimming with will to fight, barked in protest. Reito, however, shook his head and scolded him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No complaints&#8230;if you won’t listen, you’re skipping dinner tonight.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;arf.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr was a bit miffed about the whole affair, but ran off immediately and charged towards the two Blood Bears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooooff!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaahh…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Ullr ran at full speed, he could easily dodge the Blood Bears’ attacks. Thanks to Reito’s training, he also became skilled at jumping on tree branches.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr thus started darting around the Blood Bears, keeping them focused on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blood Bears swung their arms wildly, but Ullr continued jumping from tree to tree, making them miss every time. Reito, impressed by Ullr’s skill in confusing his opponents, focused on his hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito chanted the words and a large two-handed sword appeared in his hands.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-56499898' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-56499898' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blade was about four times thicker than a regular longsword, the total length over 2 meters. In order to be able to wield such a sword, longer than his height, Reito used the Support spell Muscle Boost and Tech Skill Might.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then made the blade vibrate to boost its sharpness to the max.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to be sure to finish off the wounded father bear, he gave Ullr a new order.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr! Keep the mother busy!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr immediately obeyed the order: he jumped on the mother bear’s snout and bit her ear, causing the monster to stagger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not waste time to approach the father bear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The father bear spotted Reito and raised its arms high.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHHH!!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whirlwind!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blood Bear swung its arms down, trying to crush Reito: the latter countered with a Swordsman Battle Skill, a lateral sweep with his broadsword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadsword and the father bear’s arms collided, producing a large splatter of blood on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all belonged to the father bear’s arms, naturally. Seeing the large, gaping wounds, the father bear opened its eyes wide in anger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAH….!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s over!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito charged the father bear and stabbed the broadsword into the monster’s chest. After confirming the vibrating blade had pierced its target, he activated a Battle Art.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRUAAHHHHH!!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito swung the blade down, cutting through the father bear’s flesh. The Blood Bear howled in agony, then slumped down to the ground, lifeless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito adjusted his breath, then slowly turned around. At that very same moment, Ullr was swatted away by the mother bear and came flying towards him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awooo!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whaah!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, taken by surprise, stumbled and fell. The furious mother bear rushed towards them at mad speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster’s claws were descending on the fallen Reito. It seemed to be all over — when a shadow appeared behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeee!!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shadow jumped on the Blood Bear’s snout: it belonged to the Goblin who exchanged food with Reito. Maybe it had been attacked by the Blood Bears, as it was bleeding profusely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the mother bear’s attacks, the Goblin resisted desperately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito shouted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you&#8230;trying to protect us!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeeehhh!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin’s brave stand did not last long, however: the mother bear grabbed its body and easily tore it away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Squeezed by the Blood Bear’s powerful grip, the Goblin grimaced in pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito instinctively readied his broadsword to attack, but — </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAAHHH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeeyah…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother bear crushed the Goblin in its claws.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of creaking, shattering bones echoed in the surroundings. A mix of foam and blood spurted from the Goblin’s mouth, as its head hung down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito clenched his teeth and attacked the mother bear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DAMN YOU&#8230;!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROA—!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the mother bear’s hind legs was cut off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bear monster lost its balance. Reito did not stop, however, and stabbed his broadsword in its other leg. The monster was thus stuck to the ground, unable to collapse.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Groaaah….!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SHUT UP!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito let go of the broadsword, immediately formed Iceclad Swords on both of his hands and used them to slash the mother bear, over and over again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mind lost to anger, Reito cut through the monster’s flesh again and again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AAAAAAHH!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAAAAAahhh…..!!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, he stabbed both ice swords in the mother bear’s head — when Ullr, who had come up to Reito from behind, pulled on his clothes to stop him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah&#8230;hah&#8230;hah….!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother bear, covered in blood, was without a doubt dead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito let go of the swords and hugged Ullr, who gently licked his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;thanks.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr then kneeled beside the Goblin.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The small monster had already drawn its last breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t understand why the Goblin protected them with its life. But no matter what the reason was, it had saved them. Had the Goblin not jumped in, Reito and Ullr would have probably been killed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito wished to give the Goblin at least a proper burial, so he lifted its body up and took it back with them to their cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way back, Reito quietly thought about the Goblin that could have become his friend.</span></p>
