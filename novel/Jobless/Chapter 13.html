<h3>Chapter 13</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days after the battle against the Blood Bears…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was focusing completely on practicing with his broadsword, to forget about that tragic day. He had only used longswords until then, but the battle against the Blood Bears made him realize the great offensive power and attack range of a broadsword, so he wanted to become able to use it more skillfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito equipped weights on his arms and legs and repeatedly swung the broadsword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!! Haah!! Yaah!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could only swing it slowly, but felt that the speed of his swings increased day by day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito paused for a moment and exhaled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;I want to become stronger&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magician-type job holders had vastly inferior physical abilities to Swordsmen or Martial Artists. With regular training, however, it was still possible to improve one’s abilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito raised the broadsword and activated a Battle Art.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!! Whirlwind!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He used Helmet Splitter, a downward slash, and Whirlwind, a horizontal sweep, one after the other. The sword Battle Arts he knew were only these two at the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to increase his repertory of Sword techniques, he tried activating other Battle Arts while holding the sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Circle Parry!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-58884127' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-58884127' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, Circle Parry behaved in a different way than the usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally it would make him move his hands in a circle to deflect enemy attacks, but it made him move the sword in a circle this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if I activate Battle Arts with a sword in hand, they can make different movements&#8230;I guess they can change depending on the situation.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried using Leap followed by Whirlwind, sword in hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He jumped with good momentum, then swung the sword exactly as he landed. The unexpected movement made him almost fall forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!? The broadsword sure is hard to wield&#8230;hm?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status window appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Battle Art “Spin Strike” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overjoyed to learn a new Battle Art, Reito tried it immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito spun once and swung the broadsword. He found it so exciting that he used it several times in a row.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike! Spin Strike! Spin Strike!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTM4ODczNjg5MDYiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he swung the broadsword, spinning like a top, Reito realized that the sword gained speed at every rotation. As he became used to it, he could control the direction of the attack to a degree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued to spin delightfully, until a sudden jolt of pain struck his wrists.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch!?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito fell down on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He let go of the broadsword and activated Recovery Boost. As the pain slowly subdued, he cursed under his breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ow ow&#8230;shit&#8230;my body can’t handle the weight of a broadsword yet, huh&#8230;I have to train my muscles again from the basics.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided that was enough training for the day. While he was resting, Ullr appeared with a Horned Rabbit in his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Ullr, you’re back. You’ve got prey too, good job.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito praised Ullr and decided to start cooking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, we’re going to have a barbecue here today!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly skinned the Horned Rabbit, then prepared the fire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The painful realization of his lack of strength during the broadsword training made Reito decide to increase the quantity of his meals, in order to grow more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to get bigger soon&#8230;okay, from today onwards I’ll eat more meat! Let’s get stronger together, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked back, as if agreeing to Reito’s idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that day forward, Reito’s lifestyle changed drastically: in order to build his physique, he started eating all sorts of monster meat. Ullr’s meals increased in quantity too, boosting his growth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle against the Blood Bears made Reito painfully realize his lacking strength. He thought he had done everything he could before he escaped the residence, but understood that reality was still very harsh.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certain rainy day, Reito was training blindfolded, trying to learn a particular skill: a Tech Skill called “Mind’s Eye”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allowed the user to perceive the surroundings even when their vision was blocked. It was normally acquired by first class Swordsmen and Martial Artists, so very few possessed it. In order to learn Mind’s Eye, it was necessary to sharpen one’s senses other than sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, blindfolded, was meditating in a sitting posture. He could hear the sound of the rain outside and the presence of Ullr, pacing around bored.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill didn’t seem to be coming at all, however, so Reito grumbled under his breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s taking longer and longer to learn new skills&#8230;am I getting old?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice then reached his ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Rest easy, you are still young. And you’re going to learn many more skills from now on, so no complaints.』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-79919948' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-79919948' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Was that Airis’ voice? But we’re not communicating&#8230;must be my imagination&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr, puzzled, looked at his master mumbling to himself. His curiosity quickly faded, though; with a yawn, the White Wolf lied down to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, faintly detecting Ullr’s presence, concentrated again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He honed his senses as much as he could. He wasn’t supposed to be able to see anything, but something appeared in his field of sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, he saw Ullr, lying down behind him. Its silhouette was a bit blurry, but it was too clear to be a mirage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Reito realized he could see 360 degrees around himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been training to learn Mind’s Eye since two years prior, and would fall in such a state sometimes. He could often “see” what was behind him, through their presence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried recalling these experiences as he focused on Ullr’s silhouette.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s image became clearer and clearer, and little by little Reito could see other objects as well. He maintained his focus and eventually recognized the bed, the bow and arrows leaning against the walls, even his cooking utensils.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gathered his resolve, stood up and approached Ullr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll catch a cold like that, buddy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito put a blanket over Ullr, the latter jolted up on its feet. Reito patted his head to calm him down, then walked away from Ullr and looked around.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His sight should still be blocked by the blindfold, but Reito could see the interior of the cave perfectly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He picked up a spoon from the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, I thought I had lost this spoon&#8230;so here’s where it was.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito confirmed he could see perfectly inside the cave, so he tried going outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stepping outside the familiar environment of the cave could be dangerous, but he wanted to test the feeling of using Mind’s Eye more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rain’s really noisy&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was raining heavily outside the cave. With so much noise, Reito’s sense of hearing wouldn’t be much help.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito knew that encountering a monster in such a state would be dangerous, yet strangely enough he did not feel any fear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This way.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His sight and hearing blocked, Reito walked between the trees.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status screen announcing the acquisition of Mind’s Eye hadn’t appeared yet. Reito hadn’t actually learned the skill yet, but could walk without hesitation nevertheless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, he detected a hostile presence. The next moment, he could hear a pig-like squeal from the front. An Orc over 2 meters tall appeared before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROEEENK!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh, an Orc. Iceclad Sword.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could “see” the Orc armed with a stone axe. He created a sword of ice, preparing to fight against the monster.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-21856968' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-21856968' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOORRK!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, there’s another one?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRONK!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito ignored the roaring Orc and turned around: another Orc was observing him from behind the bushes. He ran towards the newcomer and swung his sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOARK!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grork!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hidden Orc was taken completely by surprise: its head flew off and the trunk slumped down, lifeless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then threw the Iceclad Sword at the first Orc. Thanks to the Accuracy and Throwing Tech Skills, the sword pierced the monster’s throat cleanly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Groaahh…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry, looks like I really got the hang of it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito defeated both Orcs in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, Detect Presence only told him the general position of other beings, but now he could even tell what kind of weapons they had.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s sharper senses then announced that a new enemy was approaching.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, guess I’ll turn back now&#8230;after I deal with you.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created another Iceclad Sword: not a longsword like before, but the broadsword type he had been practicing with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito prepared for the battle, as a giant creature approached, opening a path through the trees and bushes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaah…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Kobold…? Whoa, it’s huge!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kobold that appeared before Reito was more than 3 meters tall, much more than the average specimen. It was a so-called Mutant, a subspecies with radically different qualities from its brethren.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mutant Kobold looked in turn at Reito and the Orc corpses, baring its fangs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAH!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oops.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster howled and tried to grab Reito. The latter made the newly formed Iceclad Sword vibrate and slashed the monster’s arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vibrating blade tore the arm upon contact, sending the Kobold into a fit of pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAGH!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve gotten used to fighting big guys like you!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the three Blood Bears, the Mutant Kobold wasn’t much of an opponent. Reito raised his broadsword, targeting the monster’s chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-64693236' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-64693236' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GREAAHHH!!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle Art “Spin Strike” made Reito rotate once, then stab the blade through the Kobold’s chest, ripping it apart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mutant Kobold screamed in agony and fell down. Reito made sure the beast was dead, then let go of the broadsword and removed his blindfold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status window then appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Mind’s Eye” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cheered for a moment, but was then brought to his knees by a sudden jolt of pain through his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had been training for hours to learn Mind’s Eye: his mental fatigue was probably at its peak. He felt as tired as when he used too much magic power and fainted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t endure the strain and sat down on the ground: he decided to rest a bit on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess I went too far&#8230;I can’t use this skill too often, huh.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mind’s Eye was very useful, but just as tiring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a bit of rest, Reito slowly stood up and looked at the remains of the Mutant Kobold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its body was heavily damaged, making it impossible to collect parts or materials from it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing I can take, huh&#8230;guess I should turn back. Wait&#8230;what’s that?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kobold’s back showed a large wound, which Reito had no recollection of inflicting. Part of the fur on the right side of its body was also torn off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the meaning of this? Could there be someone else…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately contacted Airis for answers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Aeris!! Who or what caused this wound!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sighing at having to hear a joke even at a time like this, Airis replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Very similar names, completely different people&#8230;that Kobold apparently met the forest’s “boss”. It was defeated and ran off in this direction, where it encountered you. May it rest in peace&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The forest’s boss…? Didn’t you say that it was Ullr’s parents?
