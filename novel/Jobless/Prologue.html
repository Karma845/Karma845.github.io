<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shirosaki Reito, a high school student like any other, recently changed schools, since his parents’ job forced his family to move to a new town.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was waiting for the bus on the first day at the new school when something bizarre happened before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hn…? What’s this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was like the very air cracked and shattered: a black rift formed in midair. Reito backed away, surprised and a bit scared, but the rift expanded more and more, as to draw him in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what’s going on…!? I-it’s sucking me in!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black rift started pulling Reito, stronger every second. It had become large enough for Reito’s whole body to fit in: the boy was relentlessly dragged towards by the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-this is bad…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito resisted with all his might, but the rift pulled him in more and more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked around, hoping to find someone to help, but there was no one in the surroundings. Eventually, one of his arms was sucked into the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shit&#8230;!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito flailed his arms and legs, desperately resisting, but to no avail: his body completely disappeared into the black rift.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WAAAHHHHH!?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s scream echoed in the deserted bus stop. After swallowing him, the black rift quickly vanished, leaving no trace behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bus stop looked perfectly normal as if nothing happened. The only trace left of the student Shirasaki Reito was his school bag, abandoned on the asphalt.</span></p>
