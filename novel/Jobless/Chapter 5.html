<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years had passed since Reito’s rebirth in the new world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At four years old, Reito had grown physically, so his range of “exploration” had expanded too: it now encompassed the whole residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, during his usual exploration, he found a hidden passage behind the chest of drawers in a certain room. He entered it immediately and found out it led up to the roof of the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was now looking down on the residence from the roof and could see the immense forest surrounding it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never expected to find a secret passage there though&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forest surrounded the residence in all directions and seemed to extend infinitely. No other man-made buildings could be seen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was overwhelmed by such a sight. He wondered if the day he could leave the residence would ever come, and started communicating with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, I get the feeling there are a lot more secrets in this house&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『There are various contraptions and hidden mechanisms in this residence, which is true. The secret passage you just used was built for emergencies.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word “emergency” triggered another question from Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, you said you can’t see my future, right?』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-43078749' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-43078749' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, that’s right. So even if, a few seconds from now, you were to slip and fall from this roof to your death, I could not warn you in advance, so please don’t resent me if it happens.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I definitely don’t want to die in such a lame way. Anyway&#8230;I really want to start learning magic soon&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Reito, you are still four years old. It’s simply reckless to practice magic with such an immature body. You have learned a good number of skills, but your level is still 1, so it would be very dangerous for you to use magic.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito understood that what Airis said was right, so he nodded — begrudgingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;by the way, what kind of magic can a Support Magician, learn?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You shouldn’t expect too much. Compared to other Magician jobs, it’s rather unique.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Can’t you tell me more?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Let’s focus on acquiring skills for now. What would you like to learn today? You have learned Accuracy already, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized Airis deftly dodged the topic but decided to focus on learning skills until his body grew enough.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He answered Airis’ question with confidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I sure did! It took a bit of time, but I finally learned it yesterday.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled how he acquired the Accuracy skill.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTUwMjc4OTUzIiBtYXJnaW5oZWlnaHQ9IjAiIG1hcmdpbndpZHRoPSIwIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgc2Nyb2xsaW5nPSJubyIgb25sb2FkPSJhaV9yZXNpemVfaWZyYW1lICh0aGlzKTsiPjwvaWZyYW1lPgo=" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past two years, he had been practicing throwing a ball to a target he hung in his room. The servants and his mother thought he had found a new game, so they didn’t think much of his regular practice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After practicing every day for such a long time, he had finally learned to hit the target even with his eyes closed yesterday. This event prompted a status window to appear before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>Accuracy — The user is guaranteed to hit unmoving targets.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a skill learned by jobs that used bows, like Hunters and Archers, which — as the name said — improved the user’s accuracy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, feeling glad that his efforts paid off, asked Airis for more guidance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What skill can I learn next?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The skill called Far Sight. It improves your sight and lets you see very far, naturally. It shouldn’t take you as much time as Accuracy.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『How do I learn it?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Just clear your mind and look in the distance, like you did when you learned Observing Eye. If you become able to look far away without thinking about it, you should learn the skill at the same time.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay then&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito followed Airis’ instructions and gazed at the scenery before him. During the communication with Airis time was still, so even if he was on the roof he didn’t risk being yelled at by Aria.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his few years of training, Reito had learned the trick to acquiring skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was to repeat a set of motions until it became second nature. If he had to think in order to perform the motions, he was still far from learning the skill. After realizing this, Reito started practicing while keeping his mind as clear as possible, and successfully acquired various skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito emptied his mind and looked at the distant sky, a whisper escaped his lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I can see the forest&#8230;the birds are flying. There are butterflies too&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You don’t have to force yourself to speak, like when you learned Observing Eye. You should concentrate only on looking as far as you can.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because time was stopped, Reito’s eyes wouldn’t get tired. Despite this, his mental fatigue piled up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued to watch the scenery in silence. He felt like he continued for several hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, a status window appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Far Sight acquired.”&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-40389021' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-40389021' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;ah, I learned it!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Congratulations. It’s impressive that you learned it so quickly. This skill simply allows you to see far away, but I am sure it will be of good use.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay, thank you. I’m getting tired, so I’ll cut the communication now.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, a bit unsteady on his feet, closed the communication with Airis and breathed a sigh of relief. The next moment, sharp pain ran through his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Agh&#8230;it really hurts to keep the communication open a long time&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, holding his head, was about to go back to the secret passage, when he heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-young master!? What are you doing in a place like that!?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh shucks&#8230;she found me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the rear garden, where the voice had come from and found Aria, who was watering a patch of flowers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe thanks to his newly acquired Far Sight skill, he could clearly see the anger in her expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You rascal!! Doesn&#8217;t your mother always tell you not to do dangerous things!? Bad boy, bad!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bad boy, bad&#8230;really…? Anyway, I’m going down now&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito headed towards the secret passage, but the headache started making him feel dizzy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah…!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then stumbled and started falling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aaah!! Young master!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria shrieked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She tossed away the water pail she was holding and rushed to catch Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t make it in time though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito seemed doomed to hit the ground but miraculously fell into the branches of the apple tree growing next to the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;that was close.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eeh!? Are you all right, young master!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria came running under the apple tree and Reito casually waved at her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m fine, I’m fine&#8230;and I’m glad mom loves apple trees.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apple trees growing in the rear garden had been planted by the king for Aira, or so Reito was told.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aira was very fond of apples: even after they became separated, the king seemed to be looking after her to an extent.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-70185831' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-70185831' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stood back up and prepared to climb down the tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That very moment, however, the branch he was standing on snapped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His body fell straight towards the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This is bad…! Even if I have Resilience and Break Fall, if I fall from this height…!!)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distance to the soil was approximately five meters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito instinctively protected his head with his hands, when Aria reached for him with her arms and shouted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind spirits, heed my call!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gust of wind blew forward from her palms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wind pushed Reito’s body upwards, softening the fall and lightly holding him in midair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, surprised, looked at Aria and found her waiting under him, her arms stretched to catch him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re okay now&#8230;gah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried hugging Aria, but mistakenly kicked her in the face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I’m sorry!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria crouched down, holding her face in pain. Reito was eased down on the ground by the wind, then rushed to Aria’s side.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A-Aria, are you okay?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly!! You would be dead now, if I wasn’t there!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria yelled, her eyes brimming with tears. Reito’s shoulders dropped as he apologized.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m really sorry&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria then ordered Reito to sit down on the ground and started scolding him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, it would be unthinkable for a servant to scold their master’s child like that. However, their relationship was much closer than just master and servant. Which was all the more reason for Aria not to forgive Reito’s behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young master, you are still a child, you must stop such reckless behavior&#8230;if something happened to you, milady would be heartbroken.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes&#8230;I’m really sorry.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria saw that Reito was truly remorseful, so she felt all her indignation leave her and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you won’t do something like that anymore, then it’s fine.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-43221668' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-43221668' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes&#8230;ow ow ow&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria tried to help Reito stand up, but he had cramped legs after sitting with his heels for such a long time, so he stumbled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, his eyes fell on the flowers growing in a nearby patch. They were a rare kind, with crescent-shaped leaves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aria, what’s the name of this flower?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was curious about them, but Aria looked at him with wonder.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh? Are you interested in flowers, young master? Actually, to be precise these are not flowers, but medicinal herbs.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicinal herbs…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. There are many types of medicinal herbs, but this one can be used to make healing potions. You need to know how to raise it properly and have the Cultivation skill, though&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cultivation, I see&#8230;do you have that skill, Aria?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m an Elf, after all. We’re all fairly knowledgeable about plants. I have been raising medicinal herbs since I was small. I take care of all the flowers and plants in this patch, with Lady Aira’s permission.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So said Aria, with a hint of smugness, and Reito’s eyes sparkled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then pounced towards Aria and pleaded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, please, teach me too!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…? Teach you&#8230;about medicinal herbs?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria was very surprised for Reito to be interested in raising herbs, which was normally a servant’s job. His gaze, however, was nothing but serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could never force you to do a servant’s job, though&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s okay with me, really! Please?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria was unsure at first, but she knew how persistent Reito could be, so she sighed and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I guess I could&#8230;but in exchange, stop asking me to show you magic, all right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay. I already saw it once, so that’s enough!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-you only wanted to see it once…? Very well&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria was taken aback by Reito’s quick acceptance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She kept her promise, and taught Reito all she knew about medicinal herbs. He started taking care of the plants every day and helped Aria with the cultivation of the medicinal herbs.</span></p>
