<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;where am I…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito came to, he found himself surrounded by a white space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked around, but could not see anything resembling a floor. His body was floating in the air as if there was no gravity in the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-where’s the ground…? No&#8230;calm down&#8230;take a deep breath&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt he was close to panicking, so he shook his head to calm himself down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He first tried to recall how he went from the bus stop to this place: no matter how much he tried, however, nothing came to mind. When he was absorbed in the mysterious crack he also lost consciousness, apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, all of a sudden, a woman appeared before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a beautiful young lady, her facial features still showing some childish softness, a warm smile on her lips. She looked human at first glance, but also possessed several bizarre features.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her hair was a bright silver color and she had wings on her back. Not only her hair, but also her whole body glowed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(A girl&#8230;no, an angel?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl’s smile deepened, then she finally spoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Honestly, I was so surprised! How many hundreds of years have passed since I last saw a human being? Not to mention, someone so young! It’s amazing.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast with Reito’s confusion, the girl’s tone was rather laid-back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief pause of speechlessness, Reito hurriedly spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh&#8230;w-who are you!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, hello there. I should say “nice to meet you”, I guess.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl then produced a very polite bow. Reito was still overwhelmed but managed to regain some composure and timidly asked another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;ehm&#8230;what is this place?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『This is the space in between, a place that exists between worlds.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tilted his head to the side: he couldn’t follow the young lady’s words at all. She probably realized he didn’t understand, so she explained more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『To be more precise, this is the place that connects the world you were in with another world. It’s just like the space between two planets. You were thrown out of your world and ended up here. Oh, by the way, you can’t go back to your world anymore.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito didn’t fully understand yet but reacted loudly by reflex. The young woman answered his question, in a very matter-of-fact tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The reason why you can’t go back is that all worlds are lined up vertically.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“V-vertical&#8230;what? Isn’t Earth surrounded by space…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as Reito was aware, Earth was one of the many planets floating in space. The young lady, however, continued explaining about rules of nature he had never even heard of as if they were the most natural thing in the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What I mean by vertical is their phase. To use an example from your world, think of a skyscraper. Your world was like one of the floors in the building. You slipped inside a crack and fell to a lower floor, basically. There is a difference with those buildings, though: there are no stairs or ladders between worlds. In other words, there is no way to go back to the upper floor you fell from. By the way, right now you are falling through the space between floors, the space between your world and another world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was deeply shocked. He couldn’t comprehend what the young lady said, after all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young lady, however, continued with no regard for his confusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I am tasked with the management of this space in between. My role is to assist those like you, who fell into this space, and send them to another world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young lady stared intently at Reito, who swallowed his breath and finally managed to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;your role? Could it be that you’re a god— ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young lady interrupted Reito before he could finish his sentence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, I am just a manager. Certainly not a goddess or something as grand as that. To be honest, I don’t have much to do most of the time, so I usually just peek at the worlds above or below this space, and&#8230;ahem. That’s enough about me. It’s time for you to go to another world, after all.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-please wait a moment!! Is it really impossible to go back to my world?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t give up just yet, but the young lady’s reply was as simple as it was cruel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, impossible. Well, it must be quite a tragedy for you, but just consider it as an unfortunate accident. And do your best in the next world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eeh…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dismayed, Reito pictured his family and friends in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I’m going to some new world I know nothing about, without even saying goodbye to anyone&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new world I know nothing about&#8230;Reito was suddenly attacked by intense anxiety and hurriedly asked a question to the young woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey! What kind of place is this other world?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, you have finally accepted it, yes? Hmm, I suppose there is no harm in telling you&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young lady smiled happily, reflected for a moment, then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『To put it in super simple terms, it’s a fantasy world. Do you like RPGs? In this world, there are real-life monsters, and even species like Elves and Dwarves, you know.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fantasy&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Moreover, this world is evolving in a way very different from your former world. Magic is developing instead of science, it seems.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Magic&#8230;you mean…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young lady smiled and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You can use magic, just like this. Ta-dah!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young lady had a wand in her hands, out of nowhere. From the tip of the wand, globes of fire and ice appeared one after the other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was staring, dumbfounded, then the young lady snapped her fingers and the magic globes vanished.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-was that magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Correct. Oh, there is something I forgot to tell you. When you go to the other world, you will keep your memories but your body has to be rebuilt. It’s to avoid various inconveniences, you see.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rebuilt…? What do you mean?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s a whole different world, you know. The gravity is different, and for someone who lived in a world of science, using magic could be very difficult. So the only way is to rebuild your body. There’s no way a normal person can just warp in a new world and learn magic, just like that… as you see in novels.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;wait!! What’s going to happen to me, then!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alarmed, Reito pressed the young lady to answer. She seemed to be put a bit on the spot but replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, you will keep your memories and your conscience too. The process is a bit random, so you could become something other than a human being, but&#8230;it all depends on your luck.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After falling in a place like this, I don’t know whether I can trust my luck!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito fervently protested, but the young lady simply smiled again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh no, please think about it for a moment. It has been centuries since a human being arrived in this space, really. It seems to me like a stroke of very good luck&#8230;the devil’s own luck, as they say in your world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t be serious&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed in disbelief, so the young lady tried to console him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, you are the first guest I had in a very long time, so I think I can give you some advice. Oh, right! When you want to know something, just call my name in your mind. We’ll be able to talk like that. I am in possession of all information about the new world, so ask me anything, all right&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Reito’s consciousness grew dimmer..</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I can ask anything, then okay&#8230;what’s your name?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito managed to ask a question in his fading consciousness, and the young lady smiled kindly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis&#8230;the manager of the space in between. If you are ever in trouble, do not hesitate to call me. I’m usually free, so I can answer anytime.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;it’s a promise.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the last words uttered by Reito to the young lady before everything turned into darkness again.</span></p>
