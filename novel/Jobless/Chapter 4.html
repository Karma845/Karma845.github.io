<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years passed since Reito was reborn in the new world. The 2-year old Reito, thanks to his training, was now able to walk.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He often walked around the residence, much to the servants’ dismay.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They often chased him around, worried about Reito’s energy and dangerous behavior: they played their game of tag day after day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This day was no different; today’s game of tag was about to end in the servants’ victory. Reito approached a study room in a corner of the residence, when a maid grabbed him by the neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young master! This corridor wasn’t cleaned yet, please stay away!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nooo! Let me goooo!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No complaints! Honestly&#8230;why are you trying to go into the study room all the time? You can’t even read yet&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I caaan!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes&#8230;be a good boy and stay in your room.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last year, Reito had become able to enunciate pretty well. His protests, however, were ignored by the maid, who brought him back to his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things were not going too bad until then, but the maid saw picture books scattered all over the room and sighed deeply.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid’s name was Aria. She was an Elf and, as typical for her race, she had blond hair, blue eyes, and long, pointy ears. She was supposed to be in her early 20s, but her appearance was much younger than that: to Reito, she was like an older sister.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria sounded pretty troubled at the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young master, how many times do I have to tell you to keep your things in order? Honestly&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very sorry ma’am.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sure take after your mother&#8230;ah!! Don’t you dare sneak out of the room!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aw&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Aria started putting away the picture books, Reito immediately took the opportunity to go out, but Aria easily caught him again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not sorry at all, however, and made her a request instead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, then, teach me magic, Aria!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That again? Like I told you many times already, young master, it’s too early for you to try magic. Besides, I can’t use Support Magician spells.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just show me some~”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I said no! Let’s put our things in order first.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Blah&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehe, you sounded just like a sheep right now&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito acted spoiled, as typical for a child his age. Aria chuckled at his antics but continued shelving the books.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, only those with Magician or related jobs could use magic. Most Elves had Magician-type jobs, either as a main or sub job, so all of them could use magic to a degree. Aria’s main job was Spirit Magician, so she could definitely use magic, but Reito had never seen her do it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito pouted and protested.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aria, you meanie!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, yes, I’m the meanest maid in the world. Magic is dangerous, it’s not something you should play with.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that, but&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was still unhappy at the loss of a chance to see magic. As a small token of revenge, he decided to pull a prank on Aria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He assumed the most nonchalant air he could and called the maid’s name from behind her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Aria~~”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it this time, young mas&#8230;eh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria turned around but found no one. She hurriedly looked left, right, everywhere, but Reito was nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Young master!? Where did you go!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria raised her voice, confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Reito jumped on her from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gotcha!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria turned around, utterly surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yo-young master? Where were you hiding?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria was still shaken, but Reito didn’t let go of her back and just smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was behind you the whole time! But you didn’t notice, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe it&#8230;wait, but if&#8230;no, it can’t be&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria looked positively shocked, so Reito thought he went a bit overboard and regretted it. He then let go of the maid’s back and apologized.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I’m sorry, Aria&#8230;I just wanted to prank you a little&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that’s fine, but&#8230;what a mystery.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria couldn’t understand how Reito hid from her: she eventually finished putting the room in order and left, but the mystery still left her confused to no end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now alone, Reito started his communication with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis ~』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ reply was in a rather cheerful tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, I’m here. I thought it was going to be hard for you to play the small child role, but I see you’re having fun. To use the Stealth skill to pull a prank is really fitting behavior for a child, I suppose.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, I am having a lot of fun, honestly.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the two years since his rebirth in this world, Reito learned several skills under Airis’ guidance. Stealth was one of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Tech Skill often used by Assassins, which allowed the user to suppress their presence to a minimum. Reito learned it while hiding from the servants when they were looking for him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy then told Airis about something that had been troubling him for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s pretty boring to have to stay inside all the time, though. It’d be nice if I could climb over the iron fence and explore the forest&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not allowed to leave the residence’s premises by himself: he normally played in his room. He tried pleading to his mother, Aira, to let him go out of the residence, but she never said yes. According to her, the residence was surrounded by the dangerous “Abyssal Forest”. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried putting his imagination to work.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I wonder what it’s like outside&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The forest is extremely dangerous, just like your mother says. This residence was initially built to keep undesirable people away.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really&#8230;when you put it like that, it sounds like a prison. It must have been pretty difficult to build a residence in a place like this though.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis promptly answered Reito’s question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is true. Many monsters inhabit the forest, so normal people wouldn’t even be able to come close to this place.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By monsters, do you mean stuff like Goblins or Orcs?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Correct. Other animals from the realm of fantasy in your world, like Unicorns and Dragons, actually exist here.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ explanation was very easy to understand for Reito, but because of that, he realized what a terrifying environment he was in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;it really is dangerous&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『On the other hand, as long as you stay here it will be difficult for dangerous people to come here to do you harm, so this residence can also be said to be safe.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Why are the servants living here though? If I’m an accursed child that must be kept away from the castle, why would they send servants to take care of me?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’re still part of the royal family though. They might be thinking of using you in the future, so it might be troublesome for them if you died, I suppose. You might have “hopeless” jobs, but you are still the king’s sole male heir.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was somewhat impressed by Airis’ very pragmatic hypothesis, in stark contrast with her divine powers, then expressed his understanding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see. Well, now I know why I should stay out of the forest.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Let’s continue training, so you will become strong enough.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cut off communication with Airis and continued training, day after day.</span></p>
