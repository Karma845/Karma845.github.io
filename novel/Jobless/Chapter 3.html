<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About one year passed since Reito’s rebirth in the new world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was intent on learning new skills, but couldn’t acquire any after Observing Eye. As a baby, he couldn’t move as he wished, so it was quite difficult to try to learn new skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thus decided to bide his time as he adapted to this world until his body grew.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t spend his days while doing nothing, though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lying in the cradle, he communicated with Airis many times and learned about the world and the residence’s circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communication caused a mental burden on him, so if he continued for too long he would get tired and fall asleep. Sleeping was an important task for babies, as they said, so no one found his behavior strange.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, Reito asked Airis for his mother’s name and she easily replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Your mother’s name is Aira. She has accepted the current lifestyle and is thinking to live in peace with the servants.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh…? Airis, you can also tell what people think?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Only to a certain degree, but it isn’t difficult to have a general idea of their thoughts.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Amazing&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then asked more questions about his mother. She wasn’t the first wife of the current king, Reito’s father, apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then tried asking about his father too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『My father, king Baltros, is so important that he can have multiple wives?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You see, the Baltros kingdom is the only country ruled by humans, so its king is the most important human in the world, in a way. The polygamy system is also normal when giving birth to an heir is so important, I think.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;if Baltros is the only country rules by humans, it means there are other races in this world, then&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis promptly satisfied Reito’s curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, there are six races in total. Humans, like you, Elves — characterized by their long pointed ears — , the short and stocky Dwarves, the massive Giants, Beasts — humanlike beings with strong animal-like traits — and Demons, who come in various shapes and forms, but all possess high intellect.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Wow&#8230;if there are so many races, I guess they probably fight often too&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is true, the six races have a long history of conflict. About 50 years ago, however, they signed a pact of reciprocal nonaggression, which brought an end to the war. The rifts between the races still exist, however. Smaller conflicts still break out nowadays.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reflected on the six races’ conflicts, then voiced his thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, if I didn’t have these “worthless” jobs I could have become the king of the humans, right? I wonder if my life would have been easier that way.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis thought for a moment, then replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, even if you had different jobs, I believe you would have found your share of troubles. There are many citizens of the kingdom who harbor dissatisfaction towards the current king, as well as factions trying to change the law in order to let the former king’s daughters inherit the throne. Your exile from the royal castle might have actually brought you to a safer situation, Reito. If you don’t have any inheritance rights, there is no reason to dispose of you either.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I guess that’s true. In any case, I have to learn more skills and become stronger, right?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was half telling that to himself, and Airis replied happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s right. There are many dangers in this world, after all. You will soon be able to move by yourself, so I propose to start our actual training then.』</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days later, Reito became able to stand up, albeit with the help of nearby support.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he did, he started practicing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One&#8230;two&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please do your best. Let’s start by learning to move your body.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also thanks to Airis’ encouragement, Reito somehow managed to crawl to the child-sized desk in his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis had previously told him how to learn the skills he should strive for first. Following her instructions, Reito climbed on the desk. It was just about 50 cm tall, but for Reito, who had barely learned to stand up, it was quite the height.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito steeled his resolve, then bravely jumped towards the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8230;waah!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He couldn’t land upright, though, and fell down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, enduring the pain, stood back up. He returned on top of the desk and jumped down again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Deyahh!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After repeating such a bizarre process several more times, he finally managed to land on his two feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That very moment, the status window appeared before his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Resilience” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Break Fall” acquired.&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito breathed a sigh of relief and lied down on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pheew….”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>Resilience — increases physical endurance.</b></p><p><b>Break Fall — disperses physical shocks.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the description of his newly acquired skills and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito wasn’t inflicting pain on his body for no reason: his repeated jumping from the desk was for the sake of acquiring new skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Resilience” and “Break Fall” were normally learned by martial artists, but other jobs could acquire them too with proper training.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haha&#8230;ouchie.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito uttered the words, in a rather childish way, he heard light footsteps approaching.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought that his mother was coming, so he hurriedly looked out of the window. He checked that it was almost evening, so he closed the curtains and climbed on the bed. He then quickly pulled up the blanket and pretended to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, the door opened and his mother, Aira, came in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where’s my lovely little baby? Mommy came for you&#8230;oh, are we napping?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Zzz&#8230;zzz&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehe, look at my sleeping angel&#8230;I should let you sleep in peace. We’ll eat later, okay?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aira apparently thought Reito was really sleeping. She glanced at the candles in the room, but did not light them and left the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito waited for his mother’s footsteps to disappear, then opened his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry, mommy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito awkwardly apologized for tricking his mother, then waited for the room to be completely dark.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, the sun set completely and Reito’s room turned pitch black.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was only one window in the child room, as well as no ceiling illumination. The candles on the wall were the only source of light available.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I can’t see anything&#8230;oopsie daisy&#8230;ah”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried getting off the bed but stumbled and fell, face-first on the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strangely enough, however, he felt little to no pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was thanks to the “Resilience” and “Break Fall” skills he learned earlier that day, apparently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(So the skills really work&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then fumbled in the dark, trying to grasp the surroundings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch!? Wah!? Aaah!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He bumped into furniture, stepped on toys, and fell down more than once, but thanks to the skills there was minimal damage to his body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes got used to the dark in a little while, so he could see what was around him a little better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One&#8230;two&#8230;one..two&#8230;phew.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time Reito didn’t exhibit particularly strange behavior: he sat down, stood back up, practiced walking, rinse, and repeat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kinda boring&#8230;a, b, c, d&#8230;e, f, g, h&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued walking around the dark room, while practicing the alphabet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to learn the next skill, Airis advised him “to move around in the darkness with confidence”. Reito had pretended to sleep when Aira came into the room so that she wouldn’t light the candles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito eventually became able to grasp his surroundings perfectly, despite the darkness. The status window then appeared before him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Night Vision” acquired.&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito celebrated the acquisition of a new skill. His goal achieved, he immediately checked the skill’s description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>Night Vision — enables the user to see in the darkness.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then called Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, I managed to learn the skills.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, I was watching you. Very well done!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Are all skills so easy to learn, though?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was happy to be complimented by Airis, but felt a little perplexed after learning three skills in one day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis answered his doubts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It depends on your age, Reito. It’s not common knowledge, but the people in this world can learn skills the quickest in their infancy. All skills also have difficulty levels: Resilience, Break Fall, and Night Vision, the skills you learned today, are basic skills but normally require extensive training to be learned, you know.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;by the way, how many skills can a person normally learn?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It depends on the environment they live in, but on average people learn about 10 skills in their lifetime. Because of your “worthless” jobs, however, that number is surely not enough, so let’s keep learning new skills. Some skills will be out of your reach because of affinity issues, but there is no limit to the number of skills you can learn. Learn as many as you can, they can only help you.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis sounded rather excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You make it sound so easy&#8230;anyway, I’ll be counting on your advice, Airis.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Leave it to me!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication and reflected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Thanks to Airis, I could learn three skills in just one day. If I continue to train following her instructions, I should be able to become stronger, even with these “worthless” jobs!)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt brimming with excitement and shouted out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oookay! I’m going to go for it!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s tiny yell echoed in the empty room.</span></p>
