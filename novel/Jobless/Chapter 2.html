<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s consciousness awoke to a man’s irritated voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ — what is the meaning of this? How can this be!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-please don’t shout, darling&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up!! And I finally thought I had a son…! What the hell is this trash!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t!! Stop, please! He’s your child too!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito opened his eyes to see what was happening: the first thing he found was a man wearing medieval noble clothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, he realized that man was holding him up. The man looked at Reito’s face, a hateful expression on his.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Filthy trash, that’s what this is!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So snarled the man as he threw Reito to the beautiful lady standing next to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Whoa!?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman easily caught Reito in her arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That very moment, Reito finally realized what had happened to him. His body had become very small in size.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(My body shrunk…? No, could it be that&#8230;I turned into a baby?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Reito was trying to come to terms with his transformation, the quarrel continued. The woman was now criticizing the man.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How could you do such a thing…! You brute!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Silence! I was wrong to expect anything from a woman like you&#8230;out!! Leave this place, now!! Take that accursed child and leave immediately!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;understood.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman who had caught Reito walked towards the door, tears falling from her eyes. She put a hand on the doorknob and turned around.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goodbye. I loved you, once.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;please, just go and never come back!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man roared, without even looking at the woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman, holding Reito in her arms, wept as she left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From their exchange, Reito realized she was his mother and the man was his father.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His new life was already in turmoil, but unbeknownst to him, the future held many more trials and obstacles in store for him.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah&#8230;how could this happen&#8230;this boy did nothing wrong&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the room, the woman who held Reito fell to her knees, crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short while later, a group of people appeared before her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at them and shuddered. Their clothes and weapons made them look just like soldiers from the Middle Ages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What’s with these guys&#8230;are they cosplayers? Those don’t look like costumes though&#8230;could they be, real soldiers…?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the “soldiers” called to the woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady, please settle down. It is truly regrettable, but you and the child are not allowed to stay in the castle anymore. We shall lead you outside.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the group’s armor more closely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That’s not fake&#8230;these guys are real soldiers.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full realization finally struck. He was in a different world now, just like Airis told him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was still a mystery, however, why his mother was in tears, or why his father was so angry with him. The adults, naturally oblivious to his confusion, continued to talk.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A male soldier addressed the woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let us go. The airship is ready to depart. We should be able to leave without anyone noticing now.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are you going to take us!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldier fell silent for a moment, then slowly opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;my deepest apologies, milady. I cannot say that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so&#8230;very well. I will not resist, so please, do not harm this child.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the soldiers reacted loudly to the mother’s words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Harm…? How can you say that, milady!? We have sworn our loyalty to the kingdom! You are the royal consort, thus we serve you as we serve His Majesty. Please do not say such sad things&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because I am the royal consort&#8230;you say. Can you also swear your loyalty to this child then?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother quietly looked at Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldier bit on his lower lip then looked away from the mother and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I am truly sorry, but that child&#8230;regrettably, that child cannot qualify as royalty&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He cannot qualify as a member of the royal family? This child is my son!! He was born from the king and me…!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman interrupted the soldier’s words, agitated, but the latter voiced a cruel sentence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His Majesty has personally stated as much, milady. But even before that, He has claimed to have no sons&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No&#8230;he can’t&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother fell to her knees.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady&#8230;we must be on our way.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t touch me!! I will walk by myself!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldier extended a hand towards the mother, but she pushed it away forcefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldier lowered his head, respecting her wishes. Reito reached for her body with his tiny arms, trying to console her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mah&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother’s expression grew softer, as she started talking to her child.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I’m sorry, you can sleep, dear&#8230;mommy was too loud and woke you up? I’m sorry&#8230;I’m so sorry&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother, Reito in her arms, followed the soldiers out of the castle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, unable to stay awake any longer, fell into a deep sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time later…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito woke up, he thought he was outside. He looked up and found his mother’s face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face seemed so distraught the last time he saw her, but now the light of a strong resolve shone in her eyes — she was looking straight ahead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito followed her gaze and found a large residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, mah&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh dear&#8230;did I wake you up? Look, this is our new home.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uuh..?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residence was certainly not new, but it had a very dignified appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was in the residence’s spacious gardens. In the distance, he could see iron fences, taller than a human adult, surrounding the area.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother started walking, carrying Reito with her, and opened a door inside the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, a large group of people seemed to be waiting for them. They were probably the residence’s servants: most of them seemed to be in their thirties or forties, with the youngest in their early thirties. Some of the men had quite well-built physiques, suggesting that they were soldiers before starting to work as servants.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was intimidated by the rows of servants, but apparently, his mother shared his feelings too. Her expression and tone of voice betrayed her worry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who are you all…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A white-haired man, possibly the servants’ representative, stepped forward and bowed deeply.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been eagerly expecting you, milady. We have been charged with the maintenance and management of this residence. As per His Majesty’s orders, we vow to serve you.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He did…? Do you know about this child too?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother’s expression became clouded, out of concern for Reito. The white-haired man then smiled kindly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have. Many of us are in the same situation as that child, in fact. So please do not worry: no one here would ever think of causing him any harm.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;is that so&#8230;that is good to hear.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother breathed a sigh of relief, but something in the man’s words bothered Reito.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(They’re in the same situation as me? What exactly does that mean…?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white-haired man then continued speaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please come this way, Milady. A room has been prepared for the child as well.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a child’s room, in a residence like this? Yes, please show me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With pleasure, Milady.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother headed towards the child’s room, Reito in her arms. Inside, she carefully laid him down on the bed, and Reito quickly fell asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s first day in the new world thus came to an end…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito woke up, once again he found his mother with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah…..!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, you’re already up, dear?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother gently picked up Reito in her arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried to say “good morning”, but…</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wah…! Oh..!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;couldn’t speak properly yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled that he was still a newborn. He could only use his body language to express himself at this point, but his mother seemed to think he just wanted to play.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good boy, good boy&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Muh&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh dear, did we wake up with a sour mood?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked up at his mother, the dissatisfaction clearly showing on his face, and she smiled warmly, putting him back on the bed. She then playfully poked his cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awuh, uuh&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My, aren’t we very energetic today? You looked a bit sick yesterday, so I was worried, but&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother then seemed to remember something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should give you a name, now that I think about it. Let’s see&#8230;how about Rena? It sounds like a girl’s name, it’s so lovely!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah….!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito protested as much as his limited vocal capabilities allowed him and his mother cocked her head to the side, looking troubled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh? I wonder if it’s not to your liking. In that case&#8230;Rena&#8230;Rea&#8230;Rei&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By sheer coincidence, the mother mentioned part of Reito’s former world’s name, so he reacted loudly to signal his approval.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awaaah!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Rei? Do you like the name Rei?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She got it&#8230;almost. So thought Reito, and tried doing his best to express that he liked the name Reito, not just Rei.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T&#8230;to…!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He somehow managed to utter the letters, but the mother seemed still confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(She didn’t get it&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was about to give up, when—&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rei&#8230;to? Reito? Is that the name you like?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awahh!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, you seem to like it a lot. Okay then, Reito, it’s still nappy time. Sweet dreams&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mother kissed Reito’s forehead, then left the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, alone in the room, started thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Good thing I managed to keep the same name. So&#8230;I was reborn in the new world safely, more or less, but there are too many things I don’t understand yet.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, he remembered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230;that Airis person told me I could ask her anything I wanted, didn’t she?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately tried whispering the name “Airis” to himself, and something changed in him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world before him turned into a shade of grey and he couldn’t move anymore. But that wasn’t everything: he had lost all sensation in his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What’s going on now!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito voiced his surprise, but nothing came out. Having lost all sensation and command of his body, his throat and mouth did not obey him anymore. His voice simply echoed inside his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to understand what was happening, Reito was close to panicking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hello ~~ hello ~~ can you hear me? You were successfully reborn as a human child, I see~』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Airis’ voice resounded in his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Waaah!?! What exactly is happening!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ voice continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please calm down, Reito, we’re just communicating. I stopped time, so your body can’t move, but I made it so we can talk mentally. Since time is still, we can talk as much as we want.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was surprised, but calmly accepted Airis’ words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;the things you can do are pretty godly&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, even humans can stop time in this world&#8230;at least three of them?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What an incredible world I ended up in&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lot that Reito wanted to know, but he first asked questions meant to understand his current situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Where am I?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The residence you are in is located in a kingdom ruled by humans&#8230;a race just like the humans in your world, by the way. You were born into a royal family, Reito.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A royal family&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled the man he first saw in this world and the hateful expression on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis apparently realized what Reito was going to say next, so she replied in advance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, yes, you were born in quite a complex situation. Scorned by your father, the king, you were exiled from the royal castle. That is all true.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito already knew, but couldn’t help feeling a little shocked nevertheless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then shook the feeling away and asked a different question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What’s going to happen to me now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;I can’t tell. Anything related to you is outside my knowledge, Reito.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh? Wait a minute&#8230;when we first met, you said that you possessed all the information about this world&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I’m sorry, I suppose I didn’t explain enough. I possess all information about this world, its past and its future, that is really true. But Reito, you are originally from a different world, so my ability does not extend to your own future.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eeh!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was mildly stupefied by Airis’ “carefree” attitude. There were too many things going on already, however, so he decided not to dwell on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『W-well, anyway&#8230;it’s normal to not know the future, anyway&#8230;by the way, why do I understand what people say in this world?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, let me explain that. The reason is the “Translation” skill you have. Why don’t you try saying the word “Status”?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Status?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Reito thought the word, a crystal liquid-like screen appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What’s this? It looks like a menu window from a video game&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s a kind of magic called “Status”. Anyone in this world can use it. You can see your current state on this screen.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『This is magic? And even a baby can use it? &#8230;mah-mah?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What’s the point in talking like a baby now!? And you know well that I am NOT your mother!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t help feeling a bit excited as he looked at his status.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>NAME: Reito Baltros</b></p><p><b>MAIN JOB: Support Magician</b></p><p><b>SUB JOB: Alchemist</b></p><p><b>STATUS: Normal</b></p><p><b>TECH SKILLS: Translation — Allows the user to understand all languages and alphabets</b></p><p><b>BATTLE ARTS: None</b></p><p><b>UNIQUE SKILLS: None</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ voice echoed in Reito’s head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Very nice, it’s all displayed neatly, without any bugs. You are not Shirosaki Reito anymore, but Reito Baltros now.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all happened so quickly, with no way for Reito to do anything about it, but as he looked at his status he felt a kind of resolve growing inside him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Right&#8230;I am going to live as Reito Baltros from now on.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took a closer look at his status.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of his skills, however, were simply accompanied by the word “none”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only one he found was the skill “Translation”, which Airis had told him about, in the “Tech Skills”&nbsp; group.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I can understand what mother and the other people say thanks to this Translation skill, then?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s right. Thanks to that, you won’t need to learn reading or writing in this world’s alphabet either. Isn’t that nice?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see. It’s pretty helpful that I won’t need to study that, but&#8230;if I’m a baby, does it mean that my meals and toilet will&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had more or less figured the answer already but tried asking Airis all the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Your mother or a wet nurse will take care of all that, of course. You’re a baby, of course, you can’t do that on your own!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please tell me you’re joking….I mean, waaaahhhh!!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Why did you switch to the baby crying voice…?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s protests did not relent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I might look like a baby, but I’m 15 years old!! I can’t let other people do my toilet duties…!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, it can’t be helped, can it&#8230;you are very different from the other babies, though, so you will only have to endure it for about one year, I’m sure.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Kh&#8230;just kill me already*…!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『When exactly did you become a female knight captured by orcs…?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I don’t wanna!! Why do I have to get my diaper changed?! I don’t wanna I don’t wanna!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Did you start regressing mentally too now!? &#8230;ahem.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis cleared her throat, paused for a little, then spoke again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『If you hate it so much, you simply have to become independent quickly. Among the many skills in this world, there is also magic to clean dirty things. It’s normally used to heal status effects, though&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, but looking at your status&#8230;now I see why that happened&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis seemed unsure whether to say something or not, so Reito looked at his status again. He didn’t have any skills other than Translation: there wasn’t much to know after that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito didn’t know how to find more detailed information in the status window, so he asked Airis about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What exactly are skills? It looks like there are several categories, but&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I suppose I should explain more about that too— 』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ following explanation could be summarized like this:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills could be separated into three categories: “Tech Skills”, “Battle Arts” and “Unique Skills”, which all had different usages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tech Skills” were the most numerous and also the most varied: in simple terms, they consisted of talents. For example, learning the Sniping skill would increase accuracy when using bows or guns. They were only talents, though: if the user’s abilities did not take advantage of these skills, there was no point in learning them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Battle Arts” were the techniques and magic spells often found in RPGs, all skills useful in battle. A Swordsman job would learn sword techniques, while a Magician-type job would learn magic spells. Battle Arts consumed physical or magic power, however, so using them too much would quickly deplete the user’s energies.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, “Unique Skills” were skills permanently active. According to Airis, some of them could be turned on and off at will.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Airis finished explaining, she asked Reito if he understood everything.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ — and that’s the gist of it. Is it all clear, Reito?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, well, more or less&#8230;if there’s anything I don’t understand, I’ll ask again.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I just have one skill now, so it’s normal to not understand much&#8230;right?)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So thought Reito, then decided to ask about his situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Can you tell me why I was thrown out?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ tone then became a shade lower.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Do you really want to know? Well, I suppose you would. You were just born and they called you an accursed child, after all&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Do you know the reason why?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes. Like I said before, I basically know everything about this world.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis then started explaining.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The reason why you were thrown out is your job, Reito.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked again at the jobs displayed on the status window.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were two: one main job and one sub job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『This Support Magician and Alchemist?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Correct. But before we talk about them, let me explain in order.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis then started talking about the complex circumstances of the family Reito was born in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Your father is the current king of the Baltros kingdom, King Baltros XIII. The former king was your father’s older brother, but after he died of illness, your father succeeded the throne. The older brother had three daughters, but the law in this kingdom dictates that only males can govern. The former king’s consort was already dead, so the three daughters were taken in by your father.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『King Baltros&#8230;so the kingdom and the king have the same name?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Exactly. When the king ascends to the throne, he also takes the kingdom’s name. So Baltros is not only the name of the royal family but also the symbol of the king.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis paused a little, then approached the main topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Normally, when a king can not produce male offsprings, his lineage ends in that generation.&nbsp; Needless to say, the king was overjoyed when you were born. Your jobs, however, were a problem.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A problem…? Why, are they too dangerous or strong?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito didn’t understand what Airis meant and tried to guess the reason, but she sadly denied it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s the opposite, actually. In this world, Support Magician and Alchemist are considered hopeless jobs.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh? They’re weak?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis became quiet for a moment, then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;the abilities you can learn with these jobs are very particular; almost no one can use them effectively. Compared to other jobs, their growth ratio and ability increase ratio are also very bad.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was shocked, but Airis continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They both have very few battle-oriented abilities, so you can’t defeat monsters by yourself with them. But even if you join a party, your level rises so slowly that you’ll quickly become dead weight. They’re not actually “weak” jobs, but it takes a very long time for them to become useful. If you continue to train your skills and increase your level, one day you can become a great warrior&#8230;but no one manages to get so far.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Even if they’re hopeless jobs, isn’t it strange for a royal heir to be thrown out, just like that?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito voiced his criticism, but Airis replied calmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is proof of how important jobs are in this world. What do you think would happen if you became a king in a world where such worthless jobs are made fun of and looked down upon? The people would surely riot and overthrow the government,』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That can’t be&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It is sad, but it is the truth. In this world, those with worthless jobs are considered less than human. I believe you are actually quite lucky, Reito. You were cast away when you could have been killed&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito listened to Airis, without uttering a word.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, he started speaking again, a renewed resolve in his voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, at least now I know why my father despised me so much. Instead of worrying about the past, I should think about what to do from now on.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s the spirit.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encouraged by Airis, Reito asked her another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You said that people with worthless jobs are considered less than human&#8230;do you think I’ll be able to live normally, without making particular preparations or countermeasures?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I very much doubt it. Your father might change his mind and order to have you killed. There is also the possibility of someone else targeting your life, because of succession disputes. Even if such things do not happen, in this dangerous world it is necessary to become strong.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;what a world&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I understand how you feel. All I can say to you, however, is to do your best. Now that you are reborn, the only thing I can do for you is to talk like this.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ tone suggested she truly felt sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『No&#8230;that’s more than enough. I think you’ll be a great help from now on.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled that Airis said she knew everything about this world. He then asked something he had been wondering about for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis&#8230;tell me just one thing. You said that Support Magician and Alchemist are jobs that take a long time to become useful, right? Is that the truth?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;yes. The people of this world treat them as worthless jobs, but both of those jobs have incredible abilities. With proper training and fighting style, they can be used to defeat powerful monsters single-handedly.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Then please tell me&#8230;what should I do from now on?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Good question. I was waiting for those words.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t see Airis, but he somehow felt she had to be smiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how much resolve he mustered, he was still a baby: there weren’t many things he could do. Aware of his small size, nestled in the cradle, he asked Airis the same question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So, what should I do?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Let’s see&#8230;first, you should try to learn as many Tech Skills as you can. You can learn skills as a baby too, so please try doing as I say.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito nodded mentally and Airis gave her first instructions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Tell me what you can see around you.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started attentively checking his surroundings. He couldn’t move his body, as time was still frozen, but he could see ahead, at least.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then started naming everything he saw.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;I see the ceiling&#8230;and an open window. Then&#8230;a butterfly is flying.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The butterfly was frozen in midair, during the motion of flapping its wings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s perfect. They won’t move while time is stopped, so try observing the butterfly.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Observe? What do you mean?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Be quiet and keep looking at it. Try to notice as many details as you can.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not entirely convinced, but he decided to trust Airis and continued looking at the butterfly. He then mentioned the insect’s characteristics as he noticed them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Its body and wings are colored black. Only its eyes are shining blue, though. Looking more closely, I can see a striped pattern on the wings, formed by two shades of black, one lighter and one darker. Then— 』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued describing everything he noticed, then suddenly the status window appeared before his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Observing Eye” acquired.&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito checked the message and immediately tried casting the spell.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another window appeared, displaying the new skill’s detailed description.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>Observing Eye — increases observation ability to the limit.</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s a pretty simple description&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried looking at the butterfly again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could now see tiny details that he couldn’t tell before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That butterfly has a different composition of scales on the left and right wings, huh. Airis, looks like I learned a skill called Observing Eye&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Very nice, congratulations on your first skill acquisition. Have you checked its effects yet?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, I could see some details I wouldn’t be able to tell normally.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was surprised to have learned a skill just by observing a butterfly. He then tried to figure out the rules for acquiring skills in this world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Could it be that I learned “Observing Eye” just by observing the butterfly?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Correct. By the way, those with the Merchant job can learn the superior version of Observing Eye, a skill called “Appraisal”. It’s more useful, but you can’t learn it.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really&#8230;I wonder if I’ll be able to learn other skills like this.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That all depends on you, Reito. Well, I can give advice if you need it, so please rely on me.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, Reito suddenly felt very tired.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Thanks&#8230;I’d like to go back to normal now&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Very well. Until next time&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ voice faded away and color returned to the grey world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the butterfly frozen over the cradle started moving again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the butterfly fly out of the window, then the fatigue assailed him again. His eyelids grew heavy and he drifted off to sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito woke up again, it was already dark outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt extremely hungry and tried expressing it to his mother.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, aah&#8230;awaahhh!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh dear, did you wake up?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother quickly ran up to the cradle and gently held Reito in her arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Now that I think about it, I don’t know my mother’s name yet. I’d like to ask her, but I can’t talk&#8230;I’ll ask Airis next time.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite his thoughts, Reito’s extreme hunger made him instinctively bury his face into his mother’s ample bosom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry to leave you alone all this time&#8230;you’re hungry, yes?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ba-bah&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here you go, dear. Take your time and drink slowly.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mother promptly exposed her breasts and held a nipple towards Reito’s mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oh yeah, I’m a baby, so I’m going to feed on my mother’s milk&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was slightly embarrassing to suck on the breasts of a beautiful young woman, even if Reito knew she was his mother, but he couldn’t suppress his hunger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started sucking on his mother’s breast.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mmah.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehe, look at you, sucking all intently. So adorable&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(So embarrassing&#8230;)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he looked like a baby, Reito’s mental age was 15: a high school sophomore’s age.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He found the situation nothing but embarrassing but had no choice but to let his mother take care of him right now. In the end, he sucked until he was full.</span></p>
