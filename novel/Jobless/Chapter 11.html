<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After learning new skills, Reito’s lifestyle radically changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, when he practiced with the sword he used two, so he could learn to use Iceclad Sword better. Whenever he had time he also worked out and asked Aria to train him in martial arts, to be able to use Fist Strike and Heavy Strike better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria was quite confused by Reito’s request to teach him martial arts, as his jobs were magic oriented. She noticed that his resolve was firm, however, so she taught him the martial techniques she knew and what Martial Artists did to acquire new Battle Arts.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first day of this new training, Aria made something very clear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen well, young master. I’m sure you know it already, but you are a magic user: even if you imitate martial artists, you’ll never be able to grow like one. There is no need for a Magician like you to learn Battle Arts for Martial Artists.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But it’s not pointless to train my body, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that’s true, but&#8230;it can’t be helped, can it. I’ll teach you the training methods I know.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria then explained in concrete terms how to train.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, in order to train legs and waist, you must run. For starters, 100 laps of the mansion a day!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“100 laps&#8230;okay, got it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Reito confirmed he was up to it, Aria gave him weights to wear on his arms and legs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Next, we’ll train your muscles!! From today onwards, you’ll have to wear these special weights at all times!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Muscles&#8230;yes, that’s important too.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put on the weights without a word, then Aria gave the final command of his training.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last but not least, actual battle!! You will spar against me every day!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s fine with me, but&#8230;what about your work? Is it fine for you to do this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria answered Reito’s question by smiling brightly and nodding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, in order to learn new Tech Skills and Battle Arts for Martial Artists, days of strict training began for Reito. Some of the training he did was evidently too dangerous for a child to undertake, but Reito managed to handle it thanks to Muscle Boost and Recovery Boost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months after he started this new training routine, Reito learned two Tech Skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Might” acquired&gt;</b></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-25712454' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-25712454' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><b>&lt;Tech Skill “Evasion” acquired&gt;</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito continued days of training from dawn to dusk, his tenth birthday — the tenth “anniversary” of his rebirth in the other world — eventually approached.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residence’s inhabitants were preparing to celebrate the day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servants fervently made preparations for the party, while Aira and Aria were busy preparing their presents for Reito’s 10th birthday.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito himself, however, was locked in his room and would not go out. He was preparing his plan of escape from the residence with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certain day at noon, Reito opened the communication with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A&#8230;Ayers’ Rock!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’ve never even seen a picture of it&#8230;honestly, enough jokes with my name. What do you want?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After “properly” reacting to Reito’s joke, Airis changed the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『My birthday is close, but will I be able to stay here until that day?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Airis simply stated the cold, hard truth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;the order for your assassination will be given on your birthday, so it will be dangerous to stay here until that day. Your father has already decided to have you killed. You are strong enough to survive in the forest now&#8230;it might be sudden, but I say we should leave the residence today.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito himself understood that he had very little time left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thus announced his decision.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’re right&#8230;but before I go, it might be better for me to leave a message&#8230;without mentioning “that”, of course.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, well, I don’t think it would affect the plan&#8230;it wouldn’t be a problem to leave something like a farewell message I suppose.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Let us put the plan in motion tonight then. I will guide you to the next destination&#8230;your preparations are complete, yes?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yeah&#8230;the day has finally come.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with Airis.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTc0NjkzMzc0NCIgbWFyZ2luaGVpZ2h0PSIwIiBtYXJnaW53aWR0aD0iMCIgZnJhbWVib3JkZXI9IjAiIHNjcm9sbGluZz0ibm8iIG9ubG9hZD0iYWlfcmVzaXplX2lmcmFtZSAodGhpcyk7Ij48L2lmcmFtZT4K" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After time started flowing again, he went to his desk and took a quill and a piece of parchment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Reito intended to write was his will. After discussing with Airis, they had decided that he would fake his death.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the letter, Reito wrote about his intent to die and the gratitude he felt towards his mother and the servants. It was part of the plan of faking his death, but also what he really felt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then checked the luggage stored inside his Storage Magic subspace. Storage Magic’s capacity increased with the user’s level; Reito’s was currently 20, which meant that he could store up to 1000 kg inside the subspace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present he had stored essential everyday tools and, following Airis’ advice, various items Reito created himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fake death plan consisted in the following:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an incinerator in the back of the residence. That night, Reito would put bones from monsters with physique similar to his and set them on fire, to pretend he had taken his own life by throwing himself in the incinerator. He wrote as much in the will and also used Shape Change on the monster bones to make them as similar to his as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After confirming his escape plan, Reito took the wooden box and glass vial he had received for his birthday several years before, from Aira and Aria respectively.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll give back this charm. In the end, I didn’t use it&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deep down, Reito probably wished to treasure Aria’s present, so he never used the potion inside the vial.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put the glass vial on the table, then looked at the wooden box.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder what’s inside this box after all…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aira just told him not to open it until he became an adult, and Reito had kept his promise. If he was going to leave it here, however, he might as well see what it contained.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took a fork from the Storage subspace and used Shape Change to mold it into a key that would fit into the wooden box’ keyhole.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;it opened.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the box there was a beautiful, diamond-like gemstone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, intrigued, took it out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s this…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He opened the communication with Airis to ask her about it. He mentally called her name and she replied immediately.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is a Holy Light Stone, a gemstone only members of the Baltros royal family are allowed to have. Naturally, as you have been exiled, you are not supposed to have one. It was given to Aira when she became the royal consort: she decided to give it to you, apparently.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sign of his mother’s affection pushed Reito to the brink of tears, but he somehow managed to hold them back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could not take that treasure with him. Reito thanked and apologized to his mother in his heart, then put the Holy Light Stone back in the wooden box.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, we’re all set now..”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then sat on his bed. At the same time, a certain thought crossed his mind: there should still be time to talk with Aria normally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had not received the order to assassinate Reito, so she wouldn’t target his life yet. In that case, he could talk with her one last time&#8230;so thought Reito, but ultimately he gave up on that idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Because it might weaken his resolve.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heh&#8230;are they really going to murder me…?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a reality was not easy to accept: Reito started thinking deeper about his circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the possibility that Airis lied to him all this time, and his father was not actually planning his assassination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, however, was positive that it couldn’t be true. Airis had helped him more than anyone else, she had been at his side from his birth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, let’s try going out a bit.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was getting a bit bored of staying holed up in his room, so he decided to take a look around the residence. If he used the Tech Skill Stealth, there was no risk of anyone noticing him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately activated the skill and sneaked out of his room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to make sure mother and Aria don’t find me&#8230;hm?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito stepped out in the corridor, a certain noise reached his ears. He turned in the direction it came from and saw that the door of a certain room was wide open. The door of a room which was always closed, no matter what.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door of the study containing the assassination records.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Soundless Walk skill and approached the door. He hid himself behind the wall and peeked inside through the gap between the door and the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was someone inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Reito realized who it was, a cold chill ran down his spine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ — target assassination order confirmed. Commencing execution.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Aria.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito knew her voice well. Her current tone, however, was deathly cold, something Reito had never heard before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy felt an urge to yell, but managed to put his hands over his mouth just in time. He then left, as fast as he could, before he could be found.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-79938413' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-79938413' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito returned to his room, locked the door and opened the window. He made sure there was no one in sight outside and jumped down in the rear garden.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the fall, he tried communicating with Airis. The flow of time froze, so Reito was stuck in midair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito shouted her name and Airis replied, serious as never before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『This is not good&#8230;who would have thought they would act before your birthday…? Even if I cannot see your future well, this time my predictions were too shallow&#8230;I’m truly sorry&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Enough apologies, what should I do now!?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please wait&#8230;Aria hasn’t realized that you know of her real identity yet. When she goes into your room, however, she will surely find out what is actually happening. For now, leave the residence as fast as you can!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Right….damn it!!』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication while cursing under his breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought of taking one last look at his mother’s and the servants’ faces before leaving, but there was no time left. He hadn’t prepared his fake corpse either, so they would find out in no time that he escaped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaken by the collapse of his plan, Reito activated a Support Magic spell to cross the iron fence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Muscle Boost!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reinforced his muscles to the limit and activated Swift Legs to boost his running speed. Seconds later, he was in front of the iron fence surrounding the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here&#8230;goes!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Leap skill and jumped in the air with all his might. The jump still wasn’t high enough to cross the fence, but he created Ice Block in the air to use as a foothold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito landed on the Ice Block and used Leap again, successfully going over the fence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did it!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito impulsively cheered, but soon remembered he had no time for celebrations and hurried towards the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once inside, he looked back for an instant. He activated Far Sight and Observing Eye together, focusing on the window he jumped out of.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to the open window, he saw Aria.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed anxious or maybe sad because of Reito’s disappearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought she looked just like the usual Aria&#8230;but then noticed the dagger in her hand and trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a brief instant, their eyes met. Reito quickly looked away and ran among the trees, advancing deeper in the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did this have to happen&#8230;Aria!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While running, Reito couldn’t help but shout.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew this would happen since two years before, but after seeing Aria’s actions with his own eyes, he couldn’t hold back anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito rushed through the forest, tears streaming from his eyes&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One hour later, Reito was still advancing through the forest, careful for any signs of pursuers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He ran on the ground at first, but then decided to leap from branch to branch, in order to leave as few traces as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stopped and opened communication with Airis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, any pursuers?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The whole residence knows that you have fled into the forest, so there is a big commotion.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;Aria must have told everyone.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was still the possibility for Aria or other servants to come look for him. Reito, however, had become familiar with the forest’s lay of the land, so he was sure he could lose them easily.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He left the matter of the pursuers aside for the moment and asked Airis another question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Which way should I go now?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『First I would suggest to look for a place to spend the night. No matter how fast you run, it will take three or four days to cross a forest of this magnitude.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay, thank you.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thanked Airis and closed the communication.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she suggested, he started looking for a safe place to spend the night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he started moving, Reito opened his Storage subspace and took out a small glass bottle, which contained medicinal herbs ground into powder. He carefully looked around, then sprinkled the powder on himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the powder ended up in his nostrils, forcing him to sneeze.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Atchoo!! Crap, what a waste&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dousing his body with the smell of medicinal herbs had the effect of driving monsters away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito opened the Storage again and took out a dagger, which he had created by using Alchemist skills on a kitchen knife.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-53376932' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-53376932' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword consumes magic power, so I’ll carry this for now. I would have liked a sword better, but it’s pretty much impossible to make one from a kitchen knife&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started moving again, jumping from tree to tree. His fatigue gradually built up, so after a while he stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew, I guess it’s time for a break&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito carefully checked the surroundings for any pursuers or monsters, then jumped back down on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;looks like it’s going to rain.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed and looked up, finding the sky covered in grey clouds.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rain would provide drinkable water, but if his body became wet he could catch a cold. He had to find a suitable shelter as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked around and saw a rock wall in the distance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;let’s use that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito approached the rock wall, put his hands on the surface and activated Shape Change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One, two, go!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He poured magic power out of his hands and the rock started changing shape, eventually forming a small cave, enough for one person to fit in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately went inside to rest, and soon enough he heard the sound of rainfall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it started raining already.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rain grew louder and louder as time passed. If he hadn’t created the small cave, Reito would be drenched by now. Realizing this, he sighed in relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was lucky&#8230;anyway, Alchemy skills sure can be useful.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito rested while looking at the rain. Cold air from outside blew into the small cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s getting a bit chilly, maybe I should close up the entrance&#8230;hm?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was about to close the entrance of the small cave, when he heard footsteps approaching amidst the sound of rain falling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was worried they belonged to his pursuers, but soon realized they were not human footsteps and possessed no trace of hostility either. Soon enough, a monster came inside the small cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;a wolf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster was a small wolf with pure white fur. It stared at Reito for a moment, then approached him without any particular reaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, you surprised me!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wolf suddenly shook its whole body, spraying water drops everywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It did not show any sign of being afraid of Reito though. On the contrary, it walked up to the boy, stopped, and rubbed its snout on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re&#8230;not afraid of me?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Reito’s question, the wolf lay down on the soil. It might be feigning helplessness, to attack when he lowered his guard. Reito was still wary of the animal, but the latter would persist in not showing any hostility.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thus decided to ask for Airis’ opinion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, this is a monster cub, right? It doesn’t look like it’s afraid of me though&#8230;what’s going on?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That wolf belongs to the White Wolf species. It was born from the great wolf that ruled over this forest, but its parents have been killed by monsters, so now it lives by itself. It is not afraid of you because you bear no hostility yourself, Reito.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I bear no&#8230;hostility…?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis realized that Reito couldn’t quite follow and explained more in detail.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『All living beings in this forest are generally hostile to anyone outside their species. Certain weaker monsters, however, live in communities with other monsters. After losing its parents, this White Wolf has been raised by Elves for a period, apparently.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It was raised by Elves…? Maybe they wanted to use it for hunting&#8230;』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked more closely at the White Wolf.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even during stopped time, the White Wolf was looking at Reito: he felt that the monster cub was trying to communicate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The elves that raised it have already died themselves though. The house they used is nearby, why not go there?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『House? In the middle of the forest?』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, it’s not a normal house. They repurposed a cave to use it as living space.』</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication and looked at the White Wolf again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster cub was quietly looking at Reito, as if to analyze him. Reito thought it might be hungry, so he took out some dried meat from his Storage subspace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, dig in.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooff!!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-39667786' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-39667786' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Wolf immediately pounced the meat and started eating it gleefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Airis’ advice, Reito decided to go to the house the elves used to live in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice Block.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created an Ice Block over his head, to use like an umbrella. When he went out of the cave, the White Wolf cub — his meal ended — followed him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bit surprised, Reito reached out with his hand and the wolf came closer, rubbing its head against it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That behavior reminded Reito of a puppy he used to keep at home when he was a child. The White Wolf cub seemed to be really fond of him, so Reito decided to keep it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also gave it the same name he had given to his pet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen, from today your name will be Ullr.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay? Nice to meet you, Ullr.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooof!!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly named White Wolf barked loudly, as if replying enthusiastically.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr walked in the rain, towards the cave used by the elves who raised the White Wolf cub.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, they arrived at a large waterfall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s here?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito headed to the back of the waterfall, as Airis told him to along the way, and found the entrance of the cave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, and Ullr behind him, went inside the cave: it was indeed large enough for people to live in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Human beings&#8230;well, Elves&#8230;really lived here, huh&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were several pieces of furniture inside the cave, as well as a lantern hanging from the ceiling. Reito took a flint stone from his Storage and struck a light in the lantern.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good. There’s not much dust, so I guess they lived here until recently?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked around inside the cave, then noticed Ullr had a plate in its mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this your food plate?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked what sounded like a “yes” and put down the plate at Reito’s feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito opened the Storage subspace and took out some monster meat. As soon as he put it on the plate, Ullr started chomping on it, its tail swinging widely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sure make it look delicious. Well, I have no other options for now, might as well use this place as a base.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stretched his arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rain was going to wash away their tracks, and any pursuers shouldn’t be able to find the cave anyway. Reito thus decided to live there for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then noticed a blanket next to a wall and used it to keep warm. It felt rather rough to the touch, making him keenly feel the loss of his fluffy bed in the residence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;come to think of it, I have lived in a pretty blessed environment until now&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt exhausted all of a sudden and started dozing off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the possibility of monsters attacking during his sleep, but Reito had learned the Detect Presence Tech Skill as well. Thanks to it, he would be alerted if any hostile presences approached.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito eventually became unable to resist the temptation of sleep and called to Ullr, who had just finished eating the meat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good night&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito fell asleep immediately. Ullr, probably satisfied after filling its stomach, closed his eyes too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that day onwards, the cave became Reito’s home.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He planned to leave it soon, but he would end up living there with Ullr for an unexpectedly long time…</span></p>
