<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Retribution</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Get up, you sack of shit!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kicked the king in the stomach to wake him up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s okay to do this, I guess.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Guhaa!? Guoooh, guuooh! W, wha, what are you—hieek!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king coughed as he held his hurting belly, looked up at me, and when our eyes met, he screamed and backed away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I really look that scary?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it seemed that this guy was involved in the Yvel’s research, and since I killed them so easily, I guess he was somewhat aware of my might.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sound of the king&#8217;s voice, the rest of the royal family woke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining royals were Mariana, the queen, the young prince, and six others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at the other royals and called out to the king.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then, how are you going to pay for what you did to me and the elves? Honestly speaking, I don&#8217;t think your miserable life is even close to being enough to settle this&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;P, please, anything but my life&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kicked the king again, who was still begging for his life at this point.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argghh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you kill all those people, those elves who begged for their lives like that? According to the villagers, quite a few of them were kidnapped&#8230;&#8230;you gave the order, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;haa, haa&#8230;I did, no such&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just tell me and save yourself the pain?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king, who saw the look in my eyes and realized that I was serious, opened his mouth in a panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, I killed them! I&#8217;m the one who ordered the attack!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With your own hands?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king became silent again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king was so terrified that he made a stain on the ground when I invoked intimidation.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-75624916' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-75624916' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, I killed them&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I uttered that and looked at Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you want to do, Ephyr? Would you like to avenge them with your own hands?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Are you okay with that?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course I am. If one of my people is suffering more than I am, and wants revenge, I&#8217;ll definitely make them a priority over myself.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr took a few moments to answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr’s eyes were filled with intense rage and a will for revenge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After confirming this, I took out a certain sword from my dimensional storage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the sword is Fairy Pain, a spirit sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a sword that I created, one that is no less than the magic sword that Iris possesses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>NAME:</b></p></td><td><p><b>Spirit Sword Fairy Pain</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>RARITY: </b></p></td><td><p><b>Phantasm</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>NOTES:</b></p></td><td><p><b>While using this sword, the power of spirit magic is increased threefold.</b></p><p><b>By channeling magic power, it can absorb the power of surrounding spirits.</b></p><p><b>A spirit sword molded by Haruto.</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> .</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTc3NTU2MTk5NTEiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I handed the sword to Ephyr, who looked at it curiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a sword I made for Ephyr. It&#8217;s called Fairy Pain, a Spirit Sword. Please take it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pale green, translucent body of the sword was made in the image of a spirit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful. Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Oh&#8230;right, it&#8217;s all good and all, giving it to you, but it would be such a waste to use it to kill this vermin. How about this instead?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I took out was just an iron sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’re right.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr fitted the spirit sword on her waist, then walked up to the king with the iron sword in hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her hand gripped the sword tightly and forcefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her family and loved ones had been taken from her by the king’s order.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t even begin to fathom the depth of that hatred.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, wait! I mean, please wait!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king desperately called out to Ephyr, but there was no response.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, I opened my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What reason does she have to listen to you? It&#8217;s your fate.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Didn’t you say, you wouldn’t kill me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did I say that? You see, your fate was already sealed right from the onset.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hieek!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of this conversation, Ephyr walked right up to the king, who was slumped in front of her, and opened her mouth to her loved ones in heaven.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, mother. And everyone in the village. I&#8217;m going to avenge everyone now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr raised the sword in front of the king, holding it in both hands such that the blade pointed down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drop tear rolled down her cheek and fell to the floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wai—&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr then interrupted the king and plunged the sword into his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king, who was pierced through the heart, collapsed lifelessly a few moments later.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana and the Queen, who were watching, turned white, and the rest of the royals were trembling, wondering if they would be next. The young prince was crying out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others seemed to be able to do nothing but look away from the scene before them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris, and Asha all turned away from the spreading pool of blood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel was not upset, but she had an unreadable look on her face at the death of her former master.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of this, Ephyr pulled out the sword from the body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Father, mother. At long last, I was finally able to avenge you all&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr was despondent, tears streaming down her face, but after a while, she turned toward me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The look on her face was very gratified.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you very much, master Haruto. Thanks to you, I was able to avenge everyone&#8230;but are you really fine with this master Haruto? I thought you really wanted to get your hands on him too yourself?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Thank you so, so much!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Ephyr let go of the sword and hugged me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stroked her head until she stopped crying, and when she finally calmed down, I turned to Mariana and the other royals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then, you have two choices left. Survive as slaves or die. I recommend the former.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The royals shuddered upon hearing the option.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not going to sell you off as slaves. We&#8217;re only enslaving you to limit your behavior so that you don&#8217;t get some weird ideas. Consider your freedom to be naught&#8230;and of course we&#8217;ll be monitoring you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I understand. May we please have some time?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the queen who made the request.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, talk about it and make a decision.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I put the king&#8217;s corpse into the Dimensional Storage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t feel right leaving it there, and I couldn’t just cremate it right here either.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Just then, Aegan and the rest of the elves from the first group came back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Boss, we&#8217;re back.

The enemy was tougher than I thought—and by the way, who’re you calling boss?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but voice out, when did I suddenly become the boss!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Aegan and the others were all on their knees in a vassal-like posture of courtesy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, boss is the boss.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;In other words, me. No, no, no, I mean, how did you even figure?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only person who can lead us is you, master, no, boss! ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, &#8230;okay. All right, fine, but can you at least stop calling me boss?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, feeling embarrassed, but Aegan and the others all smiled and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s impossible!”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Finne and the others for help, but they just smiled at me as if to tell me to give up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  &#8220;&#8230;Sheesh, fine, I got it already, now take a break. And I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re all okay.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Much obliged, sir.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like they’d totally become my subordinates, but I didn’t mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I brought out tables, chairs, and tea sets for the number of people from the dimensional storage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris, and Asha were used to it and started drinking tea without a care in the world, but Tendo and the others, Aegan and company all had rather conflicted expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when they saw us relaxing, they immediately sat down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, Kusel also sat right at the same time as Finne and the others. If anything, she was trying to monopolize the tea cakes and was fighting with Iris. She’s a junior for pete’s sake, come on yield to her already&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I was also concerned about the actions of the royals who were still in the midst of their discussion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I heard every now and then, it seemed that the discussion would be prolonged.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they tried to escape&#8230;well, I would just chase them down and kill ‘em, case closed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The royal family’s discussion went on for a while, and when I was starting to get sleepy, it seemed to have finally ended.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana and the others all came towards me, so I stood up, too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it seems you’ve reached a conclusion, so let&#8217;s hear it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yes. We have—we have decided to become slaves.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, no surprises there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;All right. A friendly reminder, don&#8217;t make any unnecessary attempts, okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, staring at the fat man who was running his mouth saying unnecessary things during the discussion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, this is the last time I&#8217;m going to let you off the hook—&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, releasing my intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—There won&#8217;t be a next time, you’ll do well to remember that?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, the royals all passed out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Actually, there was a reason why I made them faint.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to use my slavery skills to carve slave crests on their backs so that they couldn&#8217;t see them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my skill level, I could make it so that the slave crest wasn’t visible at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do we do now, Haruto?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne asked me after I was done with the whole process.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, let’s see. At any rate, this country had been an absolute monarchy until now, right? I&#8217;d like to change that first, so that we can establish politics for the people&#8230;Kusel, do you have a minute?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Hmm? What is it?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just so you know I have no interest in internal administration—you know what, not interested.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, come on! At least hear me out!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Shit, I forgot she’s a muscle brain&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s practically hopeless getting a meathead involved in politics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, all right. That aside, I am sure that you’re excited about returning to your formal position, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not at all!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No hesitation huh! Well, I guess being an adventurer suits her better than being the knight vice-captain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, I didn’t catch any glimpse of the Knight Captain or the Court Magician&#8230;wonder where they were?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’d like to get a handle on the personnel first.

Why would you suggest that?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think Haruto has the makings of a king!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris said with a puzzled look on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;No, no, hold your horses, I want to live freely and I&#8217;m going to go back to my original world eventually, so I can’t be a king.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;re going back?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris looked up at me with tears in the corners of her eyes. So sly, that’s not fair!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I have a family. And of course, I&#8217;m not going to leave you guys behind.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Iris wiped away her tears and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Naturally!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll never be king anyway. The people will never agree to it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then I remembered something important.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “&#8230;Oh, I forgot to ask the king how to get back.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Normally you wouldn&#8217;t forget such a thing right?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> No, Tendo, you didn&#8217;t exactly have that in mind either, that reaction just now gave you away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we already did him in, it couldn’t be helped now. Well, I suppose I&#8217;d find out something if I examine the magic circle that summoned us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Tendo and the rest of the hero group were making a fuss about what to do, the unconscious royals woke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re up. I’ve engraved the slave crest on you all while you were unconscious.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The royals were buzzing as they were told something outrageous upon waking up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha-! Did you really engrave it on my body?! Wasn&#8217;t that just a threat? Do you know who I am, you bastard!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fat dude, probably unable to accept the fact that he had been inscribed with a slave crest, shouted, but immediately afterwards, he began to hold his chest in agony.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of inflicting pain on those who disobeyed their masters was triggered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, the royals despaired that they have indeed become slaves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to Mariana, who was in tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey. Princess Mariana, no—Mariana.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mariana&#8217;s body trembled at the sound of my voice, and she opened her mouth fearfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;H-How may I help you sir?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you willing to do good by the people?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;How do you mean sir?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;I have known for quite a while that the taxes in this country are heavy, and the people are also burdened by other policies such as war and agriculture. Are you willing to change that? That&#8217;s what I mean.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t Mariana who responded to my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Ughh, you want to lower the taxes? You can’t do that—AaargggGGGGHHHh!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fat guy from earlier was struggling again, trying to complain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his status, it seems that he&#8217;s a duke. Since his name is so long, I&#8217;ll just call him the piggy duke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? Did you just say something?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked with a smile, the piggy duke replied with a shiver.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, I- I- I mean, doing that would mean less money coming to us!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so you don&#8217;t mind if the people suffer, but you want to live in luxury? That explains the piggy figure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that? Aren&#8217;t people&#8217;s lives more important? Why don&#8217;t you learn to be a little more moderate?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Ughhhh, I won’t accept this! A mere adventurer dictating—GhaaaaaarrgggHHHhhh!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The piggy duke suffered from the slave crest triggered by his outburst again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s it, there&#8217;s no way this guy&#8217;s going to change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aegan, Take him out.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Aye!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Aegan threw out a knife.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-28753211' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-28753211' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knife, which was thin and sharp, made for throwing, stabbed the piggy duke right between the eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Greedy pig. You may pay with your life and apologize to our boss for making him feel uncomfortable.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan, you&#8217;re scaring me! And he&#8217;s already dead! Moreover, is it just me or has your personality undergone quite the drastic change?!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was shocked by this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I noticed the gazes of Finne and the others gathering on me, so I shook my head the best I could.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, no, I didn&#8217;t mean for him to kill in such a horrible manner, okay?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who else has a problem with the boss?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan asked, spreading intimidation, and Mariana and the others shook their heads in unison.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wise choice. Now boss, please.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, yeah&#8230;ahem. So, Mariana, what do you think?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I’m&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana was avoiding my gaze.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there&#8217;s no way she&#8217;s going to play politics with the people in mind, is there? If she was that kind of person, she wouldn&#8217;t have kicked me out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason she doesn&#8217;t say “yes” is probably because she doesn&#8217;t want to get killed like the piggy duke if I found out she&#8217;s lying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed and gave out instructions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha&#8230;it’s all right. Mariana, gather the prime minister and ministers in the conference room tomorrow morning. We&#8217;ll have a meeting to discuss the future of the state administration. Of course, the royals, including you, will not be allowed to attend&#8230;and will be under constant surveillance of the elves from now on. Keep in mind that if you do anything unnecessary, you will end up like the piggy over there—that&#8217;s all.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana and the others nodded their heads as best they could at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good. Now go back to your rooms. Aegan, assign the elves for the surveillance duty and come back to me when you&#8217;re done.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At my order, Aegan and the other elves saluted in unison and sent the royals back to their rooms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Now, let&#8217;s move to the conference room and discuss these a little more properly.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we came to the conference room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean by a state administration meeting?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr asked, so I told her what I was thinking at the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As I said before, we&#8217;re going to lower the tax rate for now. We&#8217;ll decide what kind of system we&#8217;re going to put in place at tomorrow&#8217;s meeting&#8230;in the meantime, we can fool the people by saying that the king died of illness.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s too random&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not Ephyr who replied, but Mogami.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, Mogami. What do you have in mind?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The king aside, but abolishing all taxes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right. Doing that will result in a drop in revenue, and the country will be destroyed and invaded by other countries, which is the worst possible outcome.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps he figured out all these things and voiced out? &#8230;Nah, Mogami of all people, I don’t think so.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was dumbfounded and went on to raise other concerns.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, one thing is for sure, the country is pretty opaque at the moment. There are probably people everywhere who put their own self-interest first, and there are probably glitches in politics in general, with rampant exploitation and disintermediation. I&#8217;d have to do some research to see the extent of it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s not even surprising, with such a king.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You said it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno and Finne nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;The question is, how do we improve it? I&#8217;m not sure how many of the current ministers and aristocrats are trustworthy. Better yet, we can use our knowledge of the other world to help&#8230;&#8221; </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To be honest, I don&#8217;t think I can do anything about it with my high school level of knowledge, but it might give me some ideas.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what I thought while saying all that, but Tendo nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s true&#8230;since the teacher is also here, why don&#8217;t we gather all of our classmates and prepare to rebuild the country with everyone&#8217;s help? I&#8217;m sure there are people who would be willing to help. Naturally, I and the others are down anytime.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, Mariana said she had gathered the heroes and Aegan also met them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not a bad idea. Besides, I&#8217;d like to find out more about the summoning magic circle&#8230;all right, I&#8217;ll ask Aegan to call the heroes and gather the collaborators to restore the internal administration. So guys, I’ll be relying on you all.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ““““Sure!””””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, everyone raised their voices in motivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then I instructed Aegan, who came to the meeting room, to find the heroes and gather them for the meeting tomorrow morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like we would only be able to sleep for a few hours, but we each found a suitable room in the castle to rest up.</span></p>
