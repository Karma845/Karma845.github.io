<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; At Last, The Royal Capital</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the day of departure arrived.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re golden.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and the others nodded vigorously. Wow, how dependable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay then&#8230; I&#8217;ll now explain the plan in detail. First of all, we&#8217;re going to be moving on foot, but I&#8217;d like us to split up into three groups&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see, a carriage would be conspicuous, and even on foot, a group this size would inevitably raise eyebrows”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exactly.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we will be leaving behind enough force to defend the village, it will still leave us with quite a large group. Although it will be a bit of a detour, we can avoid standing out when moving by breaking up the route among the troops.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided on a route for the invasion based on the information provided by Tendo and the others. There are three routes: the east, which is the main entrance, and the north and south, which are less guarded, so each group should take the road closest to their entry point and head for the royal capital.&nbsp; By the way, I&#8217;m planning to go in from the east, where there are more forces and security is tighter.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, so that&#8217;s how it is&#8230;In that case let me, Jill, and Ganan accompany master as one of the main forces. Faz and Gerda will be the main force of the second group, and the third group will be led by Dor and Zara, and they&#8217;ll head north and south respectively.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was going to ask Aegan to assemble the groups, since the elves would probably have some chemistry with each other, but he decided before I did.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you Aegan. I&#8217;m going to give each group a magic tool for communication&#8230;everyone, try not to kill the enemy soldiers if possible. With your skills, you guys should be able to neutralize them without killing them.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we cause any fatalities here, it will only cause unnecessary grudges.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-54821423' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-54821423' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be best to stun them or put them to sleep.&nbsp; We also have a very special item that’s perfect for the job.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone nodded vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s move out!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Roger!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——Noon, three days after we left the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our group arrived at the east side of the royal capital of Glicente.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time I had been in the capital since I was kicked out, but I didn&#8217;t feel overly emotional about it.&nbsp; Well no surprises there, I was only here for a brief moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s still some time before the night operation, so I guess we’ll be on standby.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was nothing to do, so I changed into black clothes so that I wouldn&#8217;t stand out in the dark, and after eating, I decided to rest my body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as night fell, I received word that the other groups had also arrived.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surroundings were completely dark, but the capital was still bright.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a wall surrounding the capital, so we couldn&#8217;t directly see the lights of the city, but the lights were leaking from the top of the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more time passed, and the lights slowly faded and the city fell asleep, we made our move.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto;

Of course, I climbed up too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yawn~&#8230;so sleepy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pull yourself together man. Remember you’re still on duty. If our superiors find out you&#8217;ve been yawning, you&#8217;ll be in big trouble.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I know.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m feeling sleepy, so what can I do? &#8230;Hey, at least, say something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guard turned his head and saw his partner lying on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, hey. What happened&#8230;to&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guard who ran up to him was knocked unconscious by a chop from me, as was his partner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is Alpha. Clear.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Bravo. We&#8217;re clear.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gamma here. We’re also clear.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also received a report back from the communication device.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-53873774' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-53873774' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We went down to the garden from our respective turrets and stunned the guards patrolling the garden.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other groups informed us that the soldiers&#8217; camp inside the castle was also under control.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now all that remained was the interior of the castle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good work, everyone. Group three, stay put. If anyone tries to escape from the castle, don&#8217;t let them get away. Do not harm the maids or any of the servants. Group two, rendezvous at our location.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘‘Roger!’’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I am not familiar with the internal structure of the castle. I was only there for half a day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, once everyone was gathered, I unfolded the map that Tendo and the others had made for us beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over the plan again.&nbsp; Our group will capture the royal family. The second group will support the first group by capturing the soldiers and servants in the castle. Once you have them, gather the royal family in the hall on the first floor&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the map and comparing it with the information from Tendo and the others, I was able to determine the exact location of the royal family’s bedrooms and gave them their orders, and the elves quickly moved in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, me, Finne, Iris, Asha, Kusel, and Tendo and the rest of the heroes put on our hoods to avoid being recognized and headed down the hall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way, there was a soldier lying around who had probably been stunned by the elves who had entered the castle earlier, but we ignored him and continued on our way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hall we arrived at was a familiar place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The front of the hall was slightly elevated, and there was a luxurious chair that looked like a throne——oh, so it was the room where I had an audience with the king.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to sit in that chair and wait for the mission to be over. It didn&#8217;t matter if the chair was for the king or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, I received a message that the royal family had been secured.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I couldn&#8217;t help but raise the corners of my mouth, Tendo and the others who saw the sequence of events were breaking out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Say Haruto. Are you going to kill the royal family?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Beats me. But, you know, at least I&#8217;ve come this far for revenge. But for now, I&#8217;m going to kill the king, that&#8217;s for sure. I don&#8217;t know about the rest.&nbsp; Maybe turn them into slaves?&nbsp; Ah, but the queen hasn&#8217;t done anything to me, so I guess I&#8217;ll hold off regarding her for now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others didn&#8217;t say anything back in response to my response.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You guys have also seen what&#8217;s going on in this country, haven&#8217;t you?&nbsp; I even think that this country should be destroyed.&nbsp; But that’s not up to me to decide&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who then&#8211;&#8220;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;There are those who are more deserving of that privilege than me. The ones who lost their friends, their families, their loved ones.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The elves.&nbsp; They deserve revenge more than I do.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the rest of the heroes, as well as Finne and the others, didn&#8217;t say anything and had undescernable expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean to make you guys feel that way.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s okay. I fully understand how you feel, Haruto. So please don&#8217;t worry about it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, Finne.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few moments later, all the royals who had fainted in their nightgowns or in their underwear were gathered together. Of course, Mariana, the princess, was among them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～&nbsp;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-59226189' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-59226189' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSczJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI2MTA1NjkzNDA2Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first person to wake up was, conveniently enough, the king.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wh, where am I&#8230;I uh, I&#8217;m sure I was knocked unconscious by a silhouette, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king then looked around and realized the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the royalty in the castle were lying in a state of bondage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, surrounding them were elves, all in black, with anger in their eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;E, Eeeeeeeelves!? Wh, what are you doing? Do you think you can get away with what you’re doing! All of you savage hillbilly elves will be execut——&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king&#8217;s words were interrupted not by the elves, but by me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;QUIET. This is nothing when compared to all the crimes you&#8217;ve committed. Remember what you&#8217;ve done to your people, to other countries, to other races.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While saying that, I stood up from the throne and approached the king.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you talking ab——gahaa!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing my foot digging into the Glicente King’s belly, the other royals who had been awakened by the king&#8217;s voice earlier turned pale.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose that&#8217;s to be expected. These royals have never imagined that they would be in pain.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Glicente Kingdom, no one dares to defy the royal family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the royal family is doing something wrong, no one can say anything because if they point it out, they will be punished for some random reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reign of terror by an absolute monarchy. This is the true face of the current Glicente Kingdom.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was bad luck for me and Tendo and the others that it was in a country like this that we were summoned as heroes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These guys, they probably think of the heroes as nothing more than tools of war.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the summoning had taken place in another country, things would have been different&#8230;damn, now I’ve gone off-topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Glicente King crouched at my feet, his face contorted in pain he had probably never experienced before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, I don&#8217;t know!&nbsp; “I don&#8217;t know anything——Fughuu!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I launched another kick. This time, I kicked harder than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare lie to me. I know what I&#8217;m talking about.&nbsp; Isn’t that right, Kusel?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out her name, and Kusel, who had taken off her hood, came forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right.

More like, she’s not even trying to hide it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As for how I’m still alive, I ain’t telling. And the reason I&#8217;m here is for revenge. Plain and simple.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Revenge&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusel told me you royals were the ones who attacked the elves, ring a bell? And from what the elves told me, they&#8217;re definitely your troops. Isn&#8217;t that right, Aegan?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. We checked the armor of the knights and soldiers along the way, and it was definitely Glicente that attacked our village.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glicente King, Mariana, and the others fell silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Plain and simple enough, right? Almost everyone here, with a few exceptions, wants revenge. These are people who have had loved ones, lovers, friends, confidants, and relatives taken from them at your hands. As for me, well, Princess Mariana, I think you understand me best, don’t you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then King Glicente raised his voice to call for help.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Somebody! Is anyone there!? Intruders! Kill these people! Anybody!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no soldiers or knights answered his call no matter how loud he screamed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wh&#8230;why, why isn&#8217;t anyone responding&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed out loud, enjoying his dismay.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you laughing? &#8230;!? Don’t tell me, you son of a bitch!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You guessed it. They&#8217;re all out cold. No one will be here until morning. We&#8217;ve got everything under control inside the castle walls, including the barracks.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no no&#8230;!? When did you&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A little while ago. While you lot were sleeping so soundly.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with the hellish training, the plan seemed to have proceeded a little too smoothly. Shouldn&#8217;t this guy be training his soldiers better?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, so&#8230; we have your lives in our hands, so to speak. I’m sure that’s a no brainer at this point, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you want? Is it money? Women? Status? I can get you anything you want! And I can pardon you if you quit this now, pretend like it never happened!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah thanks, but no thanks&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh that’s too bad, see money is no object, and I have lovely fiancées. As for status, that’s the least of my worries&#8230;but, saying that you can ‘pardon’ me? Who the hell do you think you are?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king&#8217;s face quickly turned blue, or rather, white.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in spite of the situation, a young man——who seemed to be the first prince named Heeris, according to his status confirmed through god eye——let out a high-pitched laugh.</span></p>
