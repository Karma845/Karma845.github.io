<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Training from Hell</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, we were gathered in the same square as yesterday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stood in front of everyone and explained the training I had planned yesterday using the Sea of Trees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a training exercise where several people work in groups to run through the Sea of Trees while defeating monsters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——So I’m going to have everyone follow this course. Of course, we&#8217;ll be joining in, too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then a few elves objected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are elves. We know the whole of the Sea of Trees in and out!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm. Seems these guys haven’t figured out why they need to run? Did they even listen to anything I just said?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lightly flicked a stone I had taken out of the subspace at the elf who had objected first.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elf couldn&#8217;t react, and the stone hit him directly on the forehead. I didn&#8217;t hit it that hard, so he wouldn’t get hurt.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See? You can&#8217;t even react to a surprise attack. I&#8217;m sure you must have heard me mention that you need to build up your stamina first, did you not?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-70297215' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-70297215' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byIKICAgICBkYXRhLWZ1bGwtd2lkdGgtcmVzcG9uc2l2ZT0idHJ1ZSI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I looked at the frustrated elf, I shot a stone each at Tendo and Mogami who were behind me. But both of them managed to avoid the flying stones while making strange noises.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you doing all of a sudden?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yuki, that&#8217;s dangerous you know!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring their protests, I call out to the elf from earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even these guys reacted way better? Don&#8217;t you feel mortified losing to them?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn, that&#8217;s&#8230;!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you frustrated? Then take my course. If not, you&#8217;ll stay the same for the rest of your life”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they all got on-board, and we left the village.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, I forgot to mention, apart from watching out for monsters, sometimes I will hurl pebbles like before at you, so be vigilant!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all started complaining, but I didn’t mind them. In a real battlefield, you could never know when and where an enemy attack will come from.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTc4NTY1NzYxMjgiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;That day, there were screams coming from all over the place in the Sea of Trees all day long.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——Four days after the training started.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ouch&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aah!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such voices still echoed in the Sea of Trees.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I was running in the lead, throwing rocks at them when they seemed to be losing concentration.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you concentrate too much on avoiding the branches, you won&#8217;t be able to avoid the actual attacks when they come.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, I threw several pebbles, and, although a few avoided them, the rest were hit directly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, on the first day, almost no one was able to avoid them. Now, as long as they concentrated, most could now avoid them, and the only time they got hit was when they were tired or distracted by another obstacle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by that afternoon, almost all of them were able to reflexively avoid or repel the stone in any situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all their earlier fuss, everyone seemed to be picking up at a fast pace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that the rest of the day can be spent training magic and coordination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having made that decision, we moved to a more open area.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I explained the content of the training to them, as expected, some of the elves started to protest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coordination? Piece of cake!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew they would say that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It&#8217;s better to just demonstrate it to them than to try explaining in words.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Finne and I decided to put it into practice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing we did was to prepare a metal target a short distance away and unleashed magic at it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Fireball&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flames hit the target and quickly dissipated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I Ignored the elves who seemed to be trying to guess what I wanted to do, and shot the flames again and again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time I finished unleashing my magic, the target was bright red.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;So?

Well, to be precise, that&#8217;s not exactly the kind of coordination I&#8217;m going to teach you though&#8230;say there’s an enemy that can&#8217;t be defeated in a conventional way, even two against one, you can use trial and error to exploit its weaknesses. It means that even the weakest magic spells can be combined to become stronger. You elves know that, don’t you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, all the elves fell silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side, Tendo and the others were talking in a relaxed manner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, thermal fatigue fracture of metal. That&#8217;s what happens when hot metal is suddenly cooled.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess that’s also a form of coordination, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Suzuno was convinced by Tendo’s words, Mogami looked at Tendo and the others as if to say, &#8220;How do y’all know all this?&#8221;.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It came up in class duh? Oh, but I guess someone who is always asleep in class wouldn’t know right.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I do not&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, you did.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While looking sideways at these classmates of mine, I opened my mouth to address the elves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Coordination is about exactly what I just told you. Depending on how the magic is combined and attacked, it can be a powerful force. And as for magic&#8230; It&#8217;s all about visualization.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves had question marks floating above their heads, as if they didn&#8217;t understand what I meant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I asked them a question.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You there. What is the most important thing in invoking magic?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elf looked as if he was about to say something that’s quite common sense.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s about chanting accurately and quickly. It&#8217;s also important to communicate with the spirits.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head in agreement, but&#8230;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-24731937' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-24731937' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re right, but not quite.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan tilted his head.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, do any of you guys have the no-chant skill?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, we have a few skilled people. So do I&#8230;at least up to medium grade magic spells”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. The first thing you need to remember is that you don&#8217;t get the no-chant skill just because you&#8217;re an expert. With the method I&#8217;ve found, anyone can acquire the no-chant skill.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves&#8217; eyes widened at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I don’t blame them, since they were denied their conventional wisdom and given hope to become even stronger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once I have them acquire the no-chant skill, all that&#8217;s left is the effort, and from that point on, it&#8217;s up to each individual.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aegan. How do you do it when you cast a magic spell with no chant?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How? Basically, I visualize the magic the same way I do when I chant. The only difference is that I&#8217;m not chanting, so it&#8217;s less powerful.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. The reason why it&#8217;s less powerful is because you think it&#8217;s less powerful if you don&#8217;t chant. The more you visualize it, the more powerful it will be.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Visualization, sir?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and proceeded to set an example.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I command thee, woman. Spirit of the wind, pierce my foe——Air Shot!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I released the chanted air shot. Let’s see, I guess the visualization follows the image of a cluster of wind flying through the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iron target that took a direct hit was slightly dented.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, in another, more detailed visualization, released with no-chant——Air Shot!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, it&#8217;s a visualization of a compressed mass of air flying at the speed of a bullet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, with a louder sound than before, the target was deeply indented.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What’s going on, Haruto?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr asks me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What did Ephyr visualize when you released the air shot?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I envisioned a ball of wind flying fast.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm. That’s different from what I envisioned. Let me ask Tendo and the others the same thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I envisioned an air cannon.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-25772735' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-25772735' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves had a similar image to either of the two.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked Tendo to try an air shot with the same visualization that Ephyr had described, the target dipped slightly. The next time I asked him to do it using his own visualization, the target was more deeply depressed than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I am sure they understand the importance of visualization.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think? The same person casting a spell with the same chant, so why is there this much of a difference?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked the elves, who were in an uproar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The chanting of magic is only there to solidify the visualization with words. Conversely, the more solid the visualization, the easier it is to cast a spell without chanting&#8230;it takes some getting used to, though. And as I&#8217;ve just shown, the power changes depending on the visualization. In other words, if you have strong visualization, you will be able to invoke powerful magic without chanting.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Tendo and the others as well as the elves both had a look of surprise on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to teach you exactly how to go about making your visualization more powerful in a bit&#8230;but first, Aegan, can you give it a try?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I described my visualization to Aegan and asked him to cast an air shot, and the target dipped deeper than it had at first.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise, and the other elves bowed to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Haruto&#8230;no, sir Haruto, thank you very much! This will make us stronger!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please don&#8217;t call me ‘sir’!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a different story with the folks in the mansion, but I’ll get goosebumps if this many people call me “sir Haruto”!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway, please don&#8217;t call me ‘sir’&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Okay. Then, what about ‘master’?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh&#8230;all right, fine. That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that nothing I could say would change this, so I decided to give up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please provide us with your guidance from now on!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and the other elves bowed deeply to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the lot who were initially hostile towards me are looking at me with respect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if they&#8217;ve had a change of heart, that&#8217;s good, right?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the training of the elves continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>

<p><br /></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so the training continued, three weeks later.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them had attained level 2 of the no chant skill, and some of them had attained level 4.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones that got to level 4 were the ones who had opposed me in some way, Tarshal, Aegan and the others, the five who had participated in the mock battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew they were determined to get back at me, but I didn&#8217;t see this coming&#8230;it was worth the effort to train them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I gathered everyone together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, I know this is sudden, but the five of you who fought last time are going to have a mock battle with me. The purpose of this is to see how much you have grown in the last three weeks of training. If I don’t see any growth, you&#8217;ll have to start the training all over again.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost everyone&#8217;s face turned pale at those words. Yeah, they weren’t really psyched about the idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see. If that&#8217;s the case, I will be giving it my all.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you didn’t, I was going to make you start the training all over again.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan was full of motivation, but his face tightened up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to the village from the Sea of Trees, we headed for the clearing we had used in the last mock battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the five of us faced each other, the elves cheered us on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Give it your all!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Definitely!

Well, I&#8217;d like to think that they became this strong as a result.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was thinking about this, the five of them were setting up their weapons of choice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We don&#8217;t need a signal to start, do we?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course not.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone gulped and the air became tense.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan was the one who broke the silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the blink of an eye, he was upon me, swinging his dagger.

It’s probably a strategy to take away my vision and besiege me from all sides.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too bad I possess detect presence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I evaded the attacks completely, and when I saw an opening, I used wind magic to clear the fog. I could keep going like this, but I&#8217;d be invisible from the outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aegan and the others were not disheartened and continued their attack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their coordination and the force behind the magic is much better than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty good response.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I praised them so, but I didn’t get a response, as if they didn’t have the leeway to.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rear guard shot arrows enveloped in wind at me, but I knocked them down with my beloved sword.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly looked for the two vanguards slashing at me from behind, and at the same time, arrows were flying at me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I flicked the arrows with my sword again, but at this point, Aegan, who had erased his presence, rushed in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s an excellent coordination that anyone wouldn&#8217;t be able to react to, but I didn’t panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hardened my left hand, the one without the sword, with the diamond skill and tried to repel the attack. But then, Aegan unexpectedly threw a dagger at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reflexively knocked it away, but Aegan had already retreated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——A decoy&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next moment, magic more powerful than before came flying at me from the five who had positioned themselves around me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It landed squarely, sending up a cloud of dust.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did we get him?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like I said, that’s usually a flag.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, it couldn’t break past my barrier magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan mutters as he saw me, unperturbed when the dust cloud clears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought we finally got him&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Erasing your presence was a good move. I didn&#8217;t notice it until too late myself. Your coordination is definitely better than before——now then, final round, be sure to hold your ground okay?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I invoked the same intimidation as I did the last time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-43289873' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-43289873' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, all five of them endured it, but it won’t be fun if that was it now would it?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I activate the combined magic of earth and fire.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first glance, it appears as just a lump of earth, but it has fire magic trapped inside. The moment it lands or is destroyed, it will explode.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, this clearing is covered with barrier magic, so there is no need to worry about the fire spreading to the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves avoided it without difficulty, but their eyes widened when they saw the explosion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh! What the hell?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hahaha, interesting right? Magic can be arranged&#8230;if you get hit, it&#8217;ll hurt just so you know.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed as I fired off spells one after another.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, if they really do get it, it’s game over, so I reduced the speed and power to the point where they could just barely avoid it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and the others were just running away, and they seemed to have no clue how to fight back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here’s another one. ——Genuine* Yamata no Orochi!” (TLN: Meaning original or true as opposed to imitation)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I invoked a spell that was an adaptation of the combined magic of gravity, darkness and fire that I had used in the Perdis capital, Yamata no Orochi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole body is still black, but this time the body is made of earth compressed by gravity magic. And each of its eight heads breathes fire, water, wind, earth, lightning, ice, darkness, and light, the basic attributes except for recovery.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was surprised at the magic they had never seen before, except for Finne.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because she had seen it once before, she wasn&#8217;t that surprised, but she tilted her head at the difference in appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder if this Yamata no Orochi is based on Japanese mythology.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, maybe so.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and Suzuno were having such a conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, they’ll notice. But it&#8217;s not quite the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Go!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I gave the order, the eight heads attacked Aegan and the other five, unleashing their magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five of them froze at the sight of the magic they had never seen before, but they quickly returned fire.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves&#8217; attacks, while being evasive, caused a wound on the head of the Yamata no Orochi&#8230;but the wound closed up in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that more of a&#8230;Hydra, maybe?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard Asakura muttering.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, guess I should say as expected.

More importantly, how are Aegan and the others going to deal with this magic&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yamata no Orochi pursues the elves, unleashing more magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it, there&#8217;s no way to cancel them out with our numbers! We’re gonna focus on evasive maneuver!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Argh!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is impossible to cancel out all eight attributes. Focusing on evasion here is the right call.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Aegan&#8217;s instructions, they all tried evading desperately, but one of them got hit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if they had found their prey, the eight heads converged upon him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the elves, who had taken their distance, launched a simultaneous attack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yamata no Orochi burned away the incoming wind-covered arrows with a breath of flame.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another head unleashed wind magic, and the flames gained momentum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the midst of it all, there was one who ran up the back of the Yamata no Orochi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it was Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan moved directly to the neck of the fire attribute and unleashed the Wind Cutter that he seemed to have been chanting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The body of the Yamata no Orochi is made of compressed earth. This made it reasonably sturdy, but the blade of wind had easily cut off its head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ooh, not bad.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to admit, this was unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan smiled and fell to the ground along with its head.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the next moment, the head of the fire attribute that had just been cut off grew out of the cut surface.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yamata no Orochi is not a living creature, but only a magic that I had given form.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it loses its head, I just have to create it again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan&#8217;s face was tinged with surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when he landed, he and the other elves quickly distanced themselves from the Yamata no Orochi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves struggled to get at the head again, but no matter how hard they dropped it, the head kept growing back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s sending the magic power to recover, they could just target me instead. However, it seemed that they didn&#8217;t have the luxury of doing so, as the Yamata no Orochi was attacking in waves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This situation continued for a while, and just when I thought it was time they gave up, Aegan made his move.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-29788624' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-29788624' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He whispered something to the four of them, and then suddenly created a mist and all of them rushed at the Yamata no Orochi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming up with such a strategy this late in the game, have they finally become desperate?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inwardly disappointed, I was about to have the heads intercept them when the five of them took unexpected actions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all dropped their weapons and swung their fists.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious as to what they were going to do, so I stopped Yamata no Orochi’s movement for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next moment, the elves, one by one, blew off the heads of the Yamata no Orochi with their fists, which were filled with the full force of their attribute magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so they struck with their fists clad in magic power* itself, not magic, and then released the magic power at the moment of impact. Didn’t expect it to be that powerful. (TLN: Also known as mana, henceforth could be interchanged to avoid confusion)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and the others continued to try to blow off the other three heads, but I am not about to let that happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Surprise, surprise, but I guess this is it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining earth, water, and lightning heads unleash their attacks simultaneously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I tried to manipulate the earth to restrain their feet, the five of them quickly leaped to avoid it, but then a huge water ball attacked them and swallowed them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mugaa?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five of them panicked as they couldn&#8217;t breathe and struggled to get out of the water.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water ball was quickly released and they dropped to the ground, but were still breathing heavily and could not move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, a cage made of lightning surrounded the five of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the slowly narrowing cage, Aegan sighed in resignation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Looks like there&#8217;s no way out. Master, we give up.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the surrender of Aegan and the others, the game ends.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmmm&#8230;well, I guess you passed. There are still some loose ends to work out, but that&#8217;s something that can only be worked out with experience. Now then, onto the next batch.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, looking around the direction of the elves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all shook their shoulders and turned pale, but there was no way they could choose not to try.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come at me. If you pass, you won’t have to go through the training again!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and unleashed my intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grouped several of them together and had multiple mock battles——the results were excellent, and they all passed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not as good as Aegan and the others, but all of them are now quite capable of combat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, I had Tendo and the others participate in the mock battle, and it seems their evasion and decision-making abilities had improved. Well, it looks like they still can&#8217;t beat the four heavenly kings of the demon tribe&#8230;and quite frankly, I&#8217;m not sure if these guys can beat them, really.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne had also grown quite a bit in her abilities, and Kusel was&#8230;right. She had become even more of a muscle head. Kinda makes me wonder, who in the world gave her an A-rank&#8230;</span></p>
