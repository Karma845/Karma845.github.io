<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; The Secret Behind the Summoning Circle</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly a week has passed since Tendo and the others headed for the dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past week, the reformation had progressed smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gathered the Prime Minister and the ministers to receive their reports and to tell them that it was time for me to leave the capital.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, my reason for leaving the capital is to head to the Nargadia Labyrinth to check on Tendo and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you all for your hard work. As I&#8217;ve mentioned several times, if there are no major issues in today&#8217;s report, I&#8217;m planning to leave the capital the day after tomorrow&#8230;thank you all for sticking with me so far.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister shook his head at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not at all, sir, it&#8217;s us who ought to offer our gratitude. If I could have my way, I would have asked Master Haruto to be king instead of Queen Mariana&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And my answer will remain the same, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, the Prime Minister had been asking me to be the king at every opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But knowing myself, there’s no way I would want to go through all that trouble, so I firmly refused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Right. I guess it’s time I give up on this matter.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to the Prime Minister, who laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, right, my bad&#8230;shall we begin with the report.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It started with the Prime Minister.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTQ0OTcwMTc3IiBtYXJnaW5oZWlnaHQ9IjAiIG1hcmdpbndpZHRoPSIwIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgc2Nyb2xsaW5nPSJubyIgb25sb2FkPSJhaV9yZXNpemVfaWZyYW1lICh0aGlzKTsiPjwvaWZyYW1lPgo=" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First of all, the investigation has been completed. It seems that all the people present there were lining their own pockets, except for the queen and the young prince, and almost all of them have been executed. As for the royalist nobles, from the documents hidden in the royal family&#8217;s private chambers, we have already made a list of our targets. All that remains now is for us to conduct an on-site investigation and seize the evidence.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, you&#8217;ve already gone that far with the investigation?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still feeling impressed, the Prime Minister continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moving on, the reaction of the people has been favorable so far. The king&#8217;s death from illness, the suicide of the first prince and others, as well as the accession of Queen Mariana to the throne seem to have been accepted with open arms. As for the other members of the royal family, we decided that they were imprisoned because their embezzlement and coup plans were discovered after the king&#8217;s death. It seems that many of them were also bitterly disappointed, so there was no protest from the people.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, I really can’t imagine how much resentment the royals must have incurred&#8230;at any rate, I guess it&#8217;s a good thing that the country is now being swept clean.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finally, about the slaves, things are also going well. We are currently in the process of sending the freed slaves back to their homeland. Even those who rebelled obediently complied when I mentioned Master Haruto’s name.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, quit using my name like some kind of magic wand&#8230;but if it contributed to the emancipation of the slaves, so be it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title of EX rank adventurer seems to have been effective.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, thank you&#8230;next, Minister of Finance.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. First of all, we have received reports that the hurried tax cuts have led to an upturn in consumption nationwide. Also, the amount of money embezzled by the royal family and stashed away was of a rather significant figure. So, we used the money for public works projects to renovate the city damaged by the Yvel incident, and to hire a large number of unemployed people. The overall economic trend needs to be observed over a long period of time, but I think we can expect a brighter future because the people are becoming more cheerful now that the king has been replaced.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, it looks like things are going better than I thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right. I&#8217;ll leave the details to you&#8230;then next is, how’s the military doing?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes sir. First of all, the knights and soldiers who were transformed into Yvels along with the first prince amounted to a third of the entire army, so there were problems with patrols and the like, but thanks to the consultation of Master Haruto and the heroes, these problems have now been resolved. Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a little embarrassing to be thanked again and again for that slight utterance he keeps referring to as consultation, even though it was just a little suggestion on route selection and review of the rotation system.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also, the recruitment of new recruits has been completed and we are now in the training phase.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right then. From now on, Glicente army will be a peace army, not an invasion army. Make sure they know that.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-59182222' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-59182222' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes sir!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, the reports from the ministers continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the meeting was over around noon, I went to the communications room, which was supposed to be used only by royalty, and decided to contact Dillan, the king of Perdis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, I had contacted him once, on the day of the attack, but I had only given him a brief report at that time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I opted to give Dillan, who responded to my communication, a brief report again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told him that I had killed the king and replaced him with a queen who was under my supervision, that I had elves working with me and that he should not worry, and that I will be counting on him if anything happened, these three points.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan seemed like he wanted to say something, but in the end he sighed as if he had given up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked out of the communications room and went to Marvelle, the chief royal magician.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The hero summoning magic circle&#8230;my apologies, but that field was completely controlled by the royal family, and I was not looped in. But I believe, the summoning room itself should still remain intact&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she said, so I couldn’t find out anything more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, I&#8217;ll just have to take a look.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finne, Iris, Kusel.

Kusel was excited to see the sword on the wall. Yup, I should have known. What was I expecting?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All I could tell was that it was a magic circle for summoning heroes. There are some small magic circles here and there, but I can&#8217;t tell what kind of effect they have, and there are many seemingly meaningless patterns&#8230;the most knowledgeable person in the country, Marvelle, was not involved in this, and as to whether the king could have created it is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nah, I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Finne, of all people to harshly deny the possibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right, which means&#8230;it must have been drawn while looking at some kind of reference.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To think that God Eye can&#8217;t see through it, it must be very rare.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-30428018' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-30428018' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked over the magic circle and observed the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t have the same divine glow it had when we were summoned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I drew the magic circle on a piece of paper and left the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right, the next stop is&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shall we go to the archives?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s a good idea.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s where the information is!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The archives huh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris, and Kusel all replied in different ways. But only Kusel was less excited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I can’t picture Kusel in the archives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, the king must have gotten some information in the archives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be clues in his office, but I should give priority to the archives first, which has the highest possibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to ask a passing maid to guide us to the archives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>

<p><br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrived in front of a large, old door.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fearfully opened the door and found a large space with a large number of bookshelves lined up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is more like a library than archives&#8230;it&#8217;s nothing short of spectacular.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect the archives of the royal castle to be this amazing.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and I let out such impressions.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew from the map that the archives were huge, but I didn&#8217;t expect it to be this big&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Kusel, is it okay for you to be saying that, as a vice captain?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&#8217;t that a pretty prominent position?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve never had a mission that required me to go inside. And personally, I&#8217;ve been trying to stay away from places with lots of books!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now I’m wondering why I even bothered to bring you along&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the three of us were having a blast, Iris remained unconcerned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aren’t they usually like this? It&#8217;s not much different from ours, I think?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, as expected from a royal&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-Is that right&#8230;I guess I should begin gathering information about the summoning circle. But with this amount of information, even I can&#8217;t&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pondered about how long it would take me to find the books related to the hero summoning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about it, I began to feel depressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the maid who was showing me around spoke to me coyly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Umm, Master Haruto&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-75635134' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-75635134' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is one librarian who manages this archive.

What&#8217;s this ‘Forbidden Library’?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTgzNTU2NTkxNTgiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s an archive where forbidden books and other valuable documents are kept. I&#8217;m the only one in the castle who has access to it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230;are you sure we’re allowed inside?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say a word if it’s Lord Haruto. You’re a Hero* who is helping in rebuilding this country after all.” (TLN: Designation by deeds as opposed to a title like Tendo and the others.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I’d like to correct one thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am no hero.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruben&#8217;s eyes widened at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is that? The country was rescued thanks to you. You saved this country, and now the capital has been restored to life. You are undeniably our hero for bringing about this change.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook my head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’m not. I&#8217;m not a hero after all. I&#8217;m just a revenger.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;A revenger?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. You may already be aware that I was summoned as a hero and was almost killed when I was kicked out because of my lack of power, and I killed the king and his guilty cohort out of revenge. I didn&#8217;t do it for the country, I did it for myself&#8230;which is why, I am by no means a hero.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruben looked sad for a moment at my words, then turned serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Still&#8230;still, you are a hero to the people of this country. No matter what you think of yourself, that won’t change.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruben’s words somehow made me feel relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were having this conversation, we reached the far end of the archives, where a heavily locked door appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruben unlocked the door, and beyond it was a staircase leading to the basement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, was another massive door, which Ruben unlocked again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the forbidden library. Please come in.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inside of the forbidden library was dimly lit with light magic in several places.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The books on display ranged from old to new and were all in good condition. They were probably preserved with some kind of magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anything related to hero summoning can be found here.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I followed Ruben, he suddenly stopped, took an old book and handed it to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he started walking again, stopped, took a book and handed it to me, then started walking again&#8230;and on and on he continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halfway through, I couldn&#8217;t carry them all by myself anymore, so I asked Finne and the others to help out as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——And that’s everything.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the last book was piled up, there were dozens of books.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a lot more than I thought&#8230;thank you for your help, Ruben. I can’t even imagine how many days it would have taken us to find them if we were by ourselves. I suppose it would be too much to ask if I could bring them out?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it&#8217;s stored in a room where only Ruben can get into, it&#8217;s probably impossible to take them out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was my thought, but Ruben shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course not. So long as you let me know, you can bring them with you if you like. Just make sure you handle them with care.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, of course. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After which Ruben said, &#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me. Please let me know if you need anything else&#8221;, and left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put the books on a nearby desk and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haa&#8230;let&#8217;s look through these for now.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-87003203' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-87003203' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone stared at the pile of books and looked blatantly disgusted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know how you feel, but we gotta do this&#8230;”</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22128" src="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary.jpg" alt="" width="1009" height="1481" srcset="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary.jpg 1009w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary-204x300.jpg 204w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary-660x969.jpg 660w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HarutoInLibrary-66x96.jpg 66w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The sheer amount. Haa!&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welp, let’s get it over with!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order, it was Finne, Iris and Kusel. Kusel was quite energetic, and&#8230;is it just me or she seemed a little too optimistic?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we searched through the mountain of books for information about our return.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——A few hours later.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are definitely related, just that&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;They are all fairy tales.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me, Finne, and Iris muttered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel, on the other hand, was long gone. She had bolted, hadn&#8217;t she?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, we checked the books and found that there was indeed a way to return.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just that, they were all fairy tales, like the hero who defeated the demon king and was sent back to his original world by god on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait a minute, I&#8217;m sure that god never sent anyone back though&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was flipping through the last book with this in mind, I found a description that caught my attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I may have found something akin to a ray of hope.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I showed the page to Finne and Iris and read it out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘The hero completed his own Return Magic Circle and returned to his original world’, apparently&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But it doesn’t contain the said magic circle though&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seems like it&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne was right, the page did not show the most crucial part, the magic circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I perused another page to see if I could find the information.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There it is&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing written on the page was a simple statement, &#8220;I fooled around with the magic circle for summoning”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&#8217;t say where or how he played with it, the only thing written was, ‘He said all of a sudden, &#8220;I got the feeling that if I fiddled with it just right, it would work&#8221;, and just like that it got activated, and then he was really gone. And since the magic circle disappeared along with him, I couldn&#8217;t record it’.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, no, you&#8217;ve got to be f*cking kidding me!?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was too messy, this offered practically no leads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, now we knew we could just fiddle around with a magic circle for summoning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We borrowed only some of the books and headed back to the summoning room.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-77218219' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-77218219' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a copy, but we wanted to compare the article with the real thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We went over the composition and mechanics of the magic circle thoroughly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time we stopped to take a breather, it was completely dark outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Dammit, we’re getting nowhere with this! Let’s pick it up again tomorrow. Let&#8217;s go have dinner and go to bed.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re right&#8230;I&#8217;ve been staring at so much text, I think my eyes are going to pop off.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Me too&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if to agree with me, Finne and Iris also nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We went back to the room to discuss our next move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks to that document, I have a rough understanding of how the summoning magic circle works. Now I just need to figure out how to go about fiddling with it, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then it looks like we&#8217;ll be able to leave the capital the day after tomorrow as planned.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. As long as I have the copy on paper, I can work with it from anywhere.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow morning, I would dig a little into the interval between the summoning, then we could get ready to leave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed and laid down on the sofa. I&#8217;d been staring at books and magic circles all day, so I was exhausted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was resting, I suddenly felt something warm on my eyelids.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reflexively picked it up, and found that it was a warm towel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I turned my head, Finne called out to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did I disturb you? I thought it would help you relax&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed that it was Finne who had placed the towel on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not at all. It was nice and warm. Thank you. This should help my eyes to recover a little.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just about all I can do to help.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, no. You were of tremendous help with the research, don’t you think? You should get some rest as well, Finne.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I closed my eyes again and placed the towel back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I certainly could feel my fatigue melting away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——The next morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed to the summoning room to do a little research.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also copied down some parts of the forbidden books that I was interested in, and now I could study the magic circle on the way to the Nargadia Labyrinth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving to the cafeteria, I ate with Finne and the others while we worked out our plans for the day and tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll leave tomorrow morning as planned, and use today for training and preparation&#8230;sounds good?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s fine.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sounds good to me too.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The labyrinth huh&#8230;I can’t wait. Gotta keep our form in training today as well!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris, Ephyr and Kusel all said so respectively.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah.

No problem.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, well, you guys get ready. I&#8217;m going to go make my rounds.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing breakfast, I headed to the government building.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I had already told them yesterday that I was leaving the capital. There were a few things that needed to be communicated, but I decided to leave everything to them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, I called Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told him that we were leaving, he got down on his knees and begged, &#8220;Please take three of us with you, or even just two!”, Aegan begged me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Aegan and the others would have to continue to monitor the royal family and nobles. In addition, they still needed to send their people back to the Elven Village, so they couldn’t afford to send any personnel resource to come with us, so I declined.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After parting ways with Aegan, I headed to Mariana&#8217;s room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana looked surprised and confused at my sudden visit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto Yuki&#8230;I mean, Master Haruto. Why have you come here?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a little harsh geez, I guess she can’t help it, so I’ll let it pass.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;m leaving the capital tomorrow, so I thought I&#8217;d stop by and say hello.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Did you come all the way here just to say that?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t miss the slight relaxation on Mariana&#8217;s face at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, yeah&#8230;perhaps now, you’re thinking you could finally make your move?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My move? What are you talking about?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, Mariana&#8217;s expression tensed up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was she always this easy to read?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unfortunately, the surveillance will remain in place even after I&#8217;m gone. It doesn&#8217;t change the fact that you have no power.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I understand.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been informed, all members of the royal family except the queen and the prince have been disposed of. The royalist nobles have all been identified through the royal family&#8217;s information channels. There&#8217;s no noble left around to take your side.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I, I see.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana managed to squeeze out a few words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the royalist nobles whom she would have relied upon were captured, Mariana would become a total figurehead queen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, this bitch will probably try to return to power by any means necessary&#8230;but as long as Aegan and the other elves are watching, that opportunity will never come.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So long.
