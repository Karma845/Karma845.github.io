<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; VS The Prince</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Aegan and the others left, two Yvels attacked us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo, with his holy sword drawn, and Mogami, with his fists held out, responded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to Tendo from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can you handle it?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We got this, Haruto. This is also our role as heroes, so leave it to us!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s expression showed confidence and determination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were having this conversation, Mariana&#8217;s eyes widened when she saw the holy sword that Tendo was holding.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Th, that sword—is the holy sword Mistilteinn isn’t it?! Shouldn’t it be with Sir Tendo&#8230;?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, Tendo, who was still wearing his hood, finally took it off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, everyone who was still wearing their hoods took them off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, it’s really sir* Tendo?! And sir Mogami too! Why are you together with sir Yuki&#8230;? 　Even Princess Iris of the Kingdom of Perdis&#8230;what in the world is going on?!”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Mariana&#8217;s confusion, Tendo announced in a dignified manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wanted to fight for justice. To carry out the justice that I believe in!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that, Suzuno, Shinonome, and Asakura spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I also believe in my own justice!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight for you too, Haruto!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The things you all have done. Crimes that can never be forgiven no matter what you do&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I also happen to believe in my own justice!&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-14097917' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-14097917' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I joined the battle against the Yvels.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Iris turned to Mariana and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My my, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen you, Princess Mariana. Have you been faring well?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, does it look that way under these circumstances?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris has quite a knack for stirring things up!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, just, forget it, more importantly! Sir Tendo and fellow heroes, are you going to betray the Kingdom of Glicente?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris said, &#8220;what does she mean by more importantly&#8230;”, and was feeling glum and dispirited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo moved away from Yvel and answered Mariana&#8217;s question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m not betraying anyone.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then why&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because that&#8217;s the ‘Justice’ I believe in!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ughh&#8230;&#8230;! 　Th, that’s right! What about your friends?! Are you going to betray them? 　They&#8217;re actually in town right now!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess by friends, she’s talking about the other heroes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tendo was unfazed and replied in a dignified manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They would understand our actions if we explained to them properly. Tell them everything you&#8217;ve done, and they&#8217;ll understand for sure&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana couldn&#8217;t say anything back to those words and fell silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving her alone, Tendo and the other five led the two Yvels to the edge of the hall and moved on to a full-scale battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, I was surprised to hear that all the heroes are gathered in the royal capital. I&#8217;d heard they&#8217;d gone on a trip, and still thought that some of them might be hanging around, but&#8230;kinda wondering what the gathering is about?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess we should be glad that none of them were in the castle. I should have done a better job of checking the map of the royal capital&#8230;at any rate, that’s not important right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey there, your lowliness* monster prince.&#8221; (TLN: A pun was intended, instead of “your highness”)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis twitched his temples at my words.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTg4MTUyNDUyNjkiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t say anything wrong, so I&#8217;m sure he’s not mad at me&#8230;probably.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;WHAT IS IT?

He’s definitely angry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For the time being, I&#8217;m going to kill all those who have turned into Yvel in the royal capital. That includes you, of course”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can YOU DEFEAT me?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Piece of cake. Even Iris can defeat you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cheeky basTARD! SHE’S a princess of a neighboring country, SO I&#8217;ve KNOWN PRINCESS IRIS for A LONG TIME, AND she doesn’t POSSESS the KIND OF STRENGTH that you SPEAK of!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps in response to Heelis&#8217;s angry voice, the last of the remaining Yvels besides Heelis attacked us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris immediately jumped out and drew her magic sword, Tonitrus.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then ran straight for the Yvel and struck him with a blow as she slipped past.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lightning lingered in the path of the sword, and as Iris delivered it, one of the Yvel’s arms fell off. The cut looked as if it had been scorched by the high temperature of the lightning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just like when I cut off the head earlier, the arm that fell off disappeared into dust, and at the same time, the arm grew back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is such a pain after all&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regenerated Yvel quickly attacked Iris.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel closed in on Iris as if to crush her, and the next moment—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Four-Lightning Stroke Swordflash&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next thing I knew, Iris had moved behind the Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as soon as she put her sword away with a barely noticeable clink sound, four thunderbolts ran along the four lines floating on the Yvel’s body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel’s body, which had been sliced open by the lightning, seemed to regenerate again, but then it turned to dust and disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A moment of silence enveloped the place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn&#8217;t me who broke that silence—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Wh, WHAT THE HELL?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Heelis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you, didn’t I? Your lowliness monster prince.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;FUCK! &#8230; It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m losing. &#8230;HOWEVER, I still HAVEN’T lost YET!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Heelis, who was swearing but not giving up on winning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Then—come at me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis swung his fist in anger, but it still looked really slow to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I evaded with plenty of time to spare, and used my sword to cut off the arm that was being swung down, before leaving the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ughh!? Still!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis growled for a moment, and soon his arm grew back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, it regenerated faster than the others. Maybe because he had a lot of magic power to begin with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was leisurely thinking about this, Heelis stuck out his palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—FIREBALL!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;He’s even capable of no-chant. Moreover, it&#8217;s much larger than a normal fireball.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can even use magic&#8230;wow, the force is nothing to scoff at too&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to avoid it without breaking a sweat as well, but the wall behind me was obliterated without a trace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;HMPH, MY magic power is PEAKING UP, WHAT DO you expect?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he can use magic, maybe I should consider changing my stance? I can&#8217;t be bothered to think about stray bullets or whatnots.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was pondering about this, Heelis on the other hand was firing magic at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved around to avoid hitting Finne and the others, and sliced up Heelis&#8217;s body little by little.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Heelis&#8217; body regenerated quickly, but as I increased my speed, it gradually began to fail to regenerate in time.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-97785983' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-97785983' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?

NOW THAT IT’S come to this, time for MY trump card&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Heelis swallowed a red ball the size of a small candy that he had taken out from somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gah, gaaAAAAAaaaAAHHHHHHh!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately afterwards, with a fierce roar, black magic power spiraled up from his entire body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little farther away from Haruto and the others, the battle between Tendo alongside the other heroes and the two Yvels continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo dodged the Yvel’s fist bearing down on him, and sliced off its arm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gotcha!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, in the blink of an eye, the severed arm regenerated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn, that&#8217;s one nasty ability&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s face twisted as he said this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s not that he didn’t know how to defeat them, and so he regained his composure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suzuno, Shinya, Natsuki. Keep the one over there at bay! In the meantime, Aoi and I will take out this one!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, Koji!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Got it!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Got it!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks guys, I owe you!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thanking the three who nodded, Tendo and Shinonome set their weapons on the targeted Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Here we go!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them pulled themselves together and rushed at the Yvel in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome, who was faster than Tendo, attacked first.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome dodged the incoming fist and slashed it down.

Shinonome Style Technique First Stance, Flowing Blade&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome parried its fist and slashed off the Yvel’s left arm in return.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Already on it!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo slashed the back of the Yvel that was left wide open.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Holy Sword, grant me strength!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if in response to Tendo&#8217;s words, the holy sword Mistilteinn glowed white.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo poured all his strength to slash at the Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the crumbling mass of the Yvel’s flesh, which must have lost its ability to recover from Shinonome&#8217;s attack, disappeared straight into dust.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two were about to relax when they saw Mogami, who was suppressing the other one, being blown away and crashing into the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ghhaah!&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-91402665' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-91402665' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““SHINYA!””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami was in the vanguard with the support of Ichinomiya, who was in charge of recovery, and Asakura, who was in charge of magic support, but he lacked the decisive power to defeat the Yvel and was finally sent flying.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please hold on Shinya, I&#8217;ll heal you right now!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ichinomiya ran up to Mogami and used recovery magic on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the meantime, Tendo and Shinonome rushed into battle the Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like it was going to be the same battlefield as before, but this time Asakura was also there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Shinonome retreated instantly after her slashing blade was blocked, Asakura&#8217;s magic was immediately unleashed on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Wind Cutter!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wind blades hit both of the Yvel’s arms, but only caused shallow wounds, which quickly regenerated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Asakura dropped to her knees on the ground.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Natsuki!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.

However—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh no you don’t! —Grand Wave!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the resurrected Mogami thrust his fist into the ground, the ground rose up like a wave and stopped the Yvel in its tracks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, Kouji, Aoi!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Mogami&#8217;s words, the two approached the Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel swung its fist, losing balance, and lost most of its power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shinonome Style Technique First Stance, Flowing Blade.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome slashed upward with the blade that had parried the fist and severed the Yvel’s arm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not yet!
