<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Status and the Princess&#8217;s Schemes<h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an hour or so, the mock battle with the entire party was over.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I expected, they were just as good as the slightly stronger adventurers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gathered everyone together, sat them down, and stood in front of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I now know what you guys are capable of. If I were to rank you as adventurers, I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re between mid-B rank to low-A rank.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the strongest among them wouldn’t stand a chance against Kusel, when I first met her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you lot fight even better than I thought, and there were even some parties with pretty decent coordination. All you need to do now is train harder&#8230;there’s still a lot of room for you to improve and become even stronger!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that, everyone&#8217;s face lit up with motivation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, who wants to go for another round? I&#8217;ll play with you some more.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with those words, they all instantly turned pale and shook their heads in unison.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps my strength is to be blamed&#8230;still, they didn’t have to reject me so vehemently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case, each of you can train on your own, and I&#8217;ll watch and give you pointers&#8230;sounds good?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was about to round up, Azuma raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When prompted, Azuma stood up and clenched his fists.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ms. Finne and Ms. Iris, would you please fight us?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? What now?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, both Finne and Iris were tilting their heads in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of ‘em are Yuki&#8217;s friends, right? If so, I want to know what they&#8217;re capable of! I would love to train with someone stronger, but Yuki is just too strong&#8230; So I figured, why not with some cuties since they seem pretty strong.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, dude, wanna go for another round.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, if they are both cool with it, that’s fine with me&#8230;so what do you think?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, why not.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m okay with it too.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Finne and the others decided to spar with the heroes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifteen minutes later&#8230;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-83596210' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-83596210' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How, how come!

Like, are we really that weak?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To think that we couldn’t best a couple of girls, what a crying shame on the prestigious title of a hero&#8230;!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three idiots were kneeling down and lamenting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result was an overwhelming victory for Finne and Iris&#8230;I already saw this coming, still.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The performance of their weapons may be a factor, but combined with their unique skills, their combat prowess may reach the upper A rank, or even S rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then parties other than the idiot trio also challenged the two, but none could win against Finne, who attacked with skill, and Iris, who toyed with them with overwhelming speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was taking a break after the mock battle and training, Orihara called out to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey Yuki, what&#8217;s your current level? You can easily overpower us, and it&#8217;s true that you eradicated 10,000 monsters from the royal capital of Perdis, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, all of my classmates turned to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone&#8217;s eyes were full of curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, they didn’t dare use appraisal without permission, which means they&#8217;re either trying to be polite or just don&#8217;t want to get on my bad side&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh! &#8230;Well, if it&#8217;s you guys, it’s cool I guess. But if you dare reveal it to anyone, then&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Then?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll make you regret that you were ever born.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said while grinning, then they all turned pale and nodded with all their might.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good. Then I&#8217;ll show you my whole status—Open Status.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I showed everyone the status screen that appeared in front of me&#8230;but they all froze with their mouths hanging open.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, in response to my voice, Orihara leaks a few words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;H-Holy fuck!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Is it that surprising?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then tried looking at my status personally.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTg3MjA3NDUxODMiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>NAME:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>Yuki Haruto</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>LEVEL:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>355</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>AGE:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>17</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>SPECIES:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>Human (Otherworlder)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>UNIQUE SKILLS:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>All Creation</b></p><p><b>God Eye</b></p><p><b>Max Skill Growth</b></p><p><b>Experience Boost</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>SKILLS:</b></p></td><td><p><b>Martial Unification</b></p><p><b>Magic Unification</b></p><p><b>Language Comprehension</b></p><p><b>Parallel Thought</b></p><p><b>Accelerated Thought</b></p><p><b>Copy</b></p><p><b>Fighting Demon</b></p><p><b>Limit Break</b></p><p><b>Social Arts</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>TITLES:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>Otherworlder</b></p><p><b>Unique Skill User</b></p><p><b>Monarch of War</b></p><p><b>Monarch of Magic</b></p><p><b>Transcendent One</b></p><p><b>EX Rank Adventurer</b></p><p><b>Demon King</b></p><p><b>Annihilator</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, it seems I’ve leveled up again, probably from the training at the Elven Village and the battle against the Yvels.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My skills haven&#8217;t really changed since I haven&#8217;t added any recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess that&#8217;s about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Hmm, from a conventional standpoint, I suppose it’s an insanely outrageous status.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My God~&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your level alone is above 350&#8230;that&#8217;s more than five times as high as ours.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we were trying to beat this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s a lot of unique skills&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Martial unification and magic unification?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered the questions of my buzzing classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Those two were just merged into the display because there were so many skills. Magic and martial arts skills, although they&#8217;re all integrated together&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how many skills have been merged, to be honest.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all replied with, &#8220;No way”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Yuki. What’s with this &#8216;Demon King&#8217; title?

(TLN: Eighth Grader Syndrome, used to refer to teens who exhibit grandiose delusions)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the mock battle, we moved to the conference room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since almost everyone was present, I wanted to decide what we were going to do next.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The members were me, Finne, Iris, and my classmates who had participated in the mock battle earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were joined by Asha, Kusel, Ephyr, Aegan, and Ms. Usami.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stood in front of everyone and looked around at everyone’s faces before opening my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d like to discuss our course of action going forward—first of all, I don’t intend to return to the Kingdom of Perdis or any other country for the time being, but to help rebuild this country until it’s a little bit stable. Not to mention that I still need to investigate the summoning circle.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, Iris and Asha nodded to those words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will, of course, follow you, Haruto.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course I&#8217;m with you!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll follow the Princess and Haruto anywhere of course!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After nodding to the three of them, Ephyr called out to me in a frightened voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm, master Haruto. Of course I&#8217;m going to follow you, but I would very much like to inform my village about the outcome of our expedition this time&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr’s words were met with an offer from Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lady Ephyr, in that case, please leave it to us. Some of us have already returned to the village to report back, and half of us who participated in this mission are expected to return. The other half, including myself, will stay here to monitor the royal family.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you Aegan. Master Haruto, I’ll be joining you then!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, thank you, Ephyr&#8230;what about you, Kusel?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, then turned to Kusel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm, of course I&#8217;m coming with you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I see. ‘Of course’ huh&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s okay, though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, I looked towards Tendo and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What about you guys, Tendo?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like they were discussing something while I was talking to Finne and the rest, so they must have decided on some kind of objective.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Tendo looked straight at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, you said that the four Heavenly Kings of the Demon King&#8217;s Army have a level above 100, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s right. The guy I defeated was at Level 137, I think. I&#8217;m sure the others are likely to be of similar levels too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Demon King&#8230;oh, you mean the real Demon King. I&#8217;m sure he must be on a higher level than that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh quit with the weird acting, it’s rather making the atmosphere feel awkward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Maybe.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo nodded at my answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sure that as we are now, we stand no chance against the Demon King or even the Four Heavenly Kings. Which is why I’m thinking of going to a dungeon, so we could grind our levels&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, that&#8217;s actually well thought out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly used the map function of the God Eye to look for a suitable dungeon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I found one, the Nargadia Labyrinth. I’m not sure why I can&#8217;t see any information about the boss, but&#8230; it&#8217;s probably not that dangerous considering the overall level.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right&#8230;there is a dungeon called Nargadia Labyrinth, go there and train. The goal is to be able to clear the dungeon as a party with ease. I’m sure you should be able to attain the might to fight the Four Heavenly Kings&#8230; It&#8217;s a little tough for you guys as you are right now, but I think you can just about make it to the middle tier. That should give you an idea of the difficulty.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My classmates&#8217; expressions turned grim at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. If anything happens, I&#8217;ll come to your aid, and in any case, we should also be there in about a week or so. I&#8217;ll also hand you a very special item.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An item?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right, it&#8217;s an item that protects you only once from an instant death magic attack. It won&#8217;t protect you from physical attacks, so be careful.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, and brought out the item.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>NAME:&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>Guardian Talisman</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>RARITY:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p></td><td><p><b>Legend</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>NOTES:&nbsp;</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-20149460' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-20149460' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div></td><td><p><b>Protects the wearer of this item once from all magical attacks that can cause certain death.</b></p><p><b>Immediately after it is used, the item will disappear.</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my classmates gasped at the sight of the national treasure class item, Ms. Usami asked me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yuki, where did you obtain such an item?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nah, it’s not so much obtaining it from somewhere as it is creating it, with my skills.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I replied thus, the teacher, who hadn&#8217;t seen my status earlier, was absolutely stunned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, we decided on the location and the fact that they would have to leave in two days due to preparations, thus marking the end of the meeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, just as I was about to leave the meeting room, Suzuno called out to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto. Am I also going with them to the labyrinth?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, you should go, Suzuno. Otherwise, the gap between you and us will only get bigger.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mmm~, I thought we were going to be together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno puffed out her cheeks and ran over to Tendo and the others who had left the room earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shinonome and Asakura, who seemed to have heard the conversation, turned around, glared and stuck out their tongues at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—That night.

It’s all my dear father&#8217;s fault!’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t dare utter these thoughts out loud. If she’d so much as make a fuss, the elves might kill her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘And that Haruto Yuki! Isn&#8217;t he supposed to be dead?! The knights who I gave the orders were all loyal to me, and given the circumstances, he shouldn’t be alive. Dear father also mentioned that there was an EX rank adventurer with the same name, that it was probably just a coincidence! To think that it’s the same person&#8230;how in the world did he survive?’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even if she thought about it, she would never know the answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana changed her mind and decided to think of a way to escape from the prison which is her room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem was that she had been inscribed with a slave crest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Mariana suspected that it was just a bluff, but after seeing how the duke was killed, she became convinced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaving Arts can be lifted by a practitioner of equal or higher level, even if it is not the one who cast it. Mariana, who was unaware that Haruto&#8217;s slaving arts was at level 10, a level so high that no one else had reached, was desperately trying to figure out how to get those who could use slaving arts to cooperate and remove the slave crest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana was suddenly approached by a voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—You’d better not get any funny ideas, okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana&#8217;s shoulders shook at the voice that came down from the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This voice belonged to one of the elves monitoring the royal family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana understood that ‘Funny ideas’ was synonymous to ‘Defying Haruto Yuki’.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the duke, the maid had told her that two others had also been killed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it was all Mariana could do to hide the trembling in her voice as she answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not to worry. I have no such thoughts.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Mariana&#8217;s answer, the elf Aegan, who had been monitoring her, came down off the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, yeah right. I know how it feels to have your king killed and to have been forced out of power. That disconcerting restlessness, I know all too well—after all, I too had my precious village attacked and my beloved chief, family and friends taken from me. Even right now, I wish I could just kill all the royals to sooth the feeling.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan&#8217;s words were eighty percent sincere.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king, who was the original culprit, was killed by Ephyr, the orphaned child of the former village chief, and the first prince and his knights, who were his subordinates, also perished from their hands personally after they became Yvels.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Killing innocent people would have put them on the same level as the king, and to begin with, they didn’t seem to hold a grudge against people in general.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Aegan was almost at peace with the situation, but he had no intention of forgiving Mariana, who shared the same ideology as the king, and who had tried to get rid of and kill Haruto.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s letting her live because of Haruto&#8217;s orders, that&#8217;s all there is to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence the killing intent that Aegan gave off was genuine, and Mariana&#8217;s face turned pale when she sensed it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for whatever it’s worth, she was royalty, and she was the one who had tried to use the heroes. She said back to Aegan as calmly as she could.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you really sure, it’s all right to kill me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought that she had some worth and that she would not be killed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the reason for her bold statement, but that idea was easily shattered by Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Listen carefully, my orders are to kill anyone, no matter who they are, if they exhibit any suspicious movement. And you are no exception.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-85775082' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-85775082' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana fell down on the couch in despair.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, Mariana&#8217;s guess was spot on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haruto had ordered Aegan not to kill her, as he intended to set Mariana up as a king in name only.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan, however, hadn&#8217;t bothered to mention it and had tried to break Mariana&#8217;s heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana, on the other hand, was struggling to keep her head straight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s going to happen to this country? Who will be the king? Could it be that guy?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-If I die, who will be king?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan did not open his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Answer me! Who do you think I am?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan finally opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who do I think you are? That&#8217;s a funny question. You are the daughter of a foolish king, a wench who wields power only for her own personal gain with no consideration for her people or subjects whatsoever&#8230;am I wrong?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dear father can certainly be called a foolish king. However, I—”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SILENCE!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“—Ow!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan interrupted Mariana&#8217;s words and threw a knife at her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knife, which grazed Mariana&#8217;s cheek and smeared with blood, plunged deeply into the wall behind her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan said coldly to Mariana, who was wincing in pain for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The foolish king&#8217;s daughter was no different from the foolish king himself. You may deny it all you want, but it&#8217;s all the same if that&#8217;s what people think of you.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana bit her lip, unable to say anything back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The taste of blood spread in her mouth. Then there was a knock at the door, and Aegan hid himself behind a piece of furniture.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess Mariana, I have a message from Master Haruto. May I come in?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, yes. Come in.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha—the maid who entered the room, conveyed to Mariana exactly what Haruto had told her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the message from Master Haruto. Please do not miss a word of it— ‘Rejoice, my dear Mariana, you’re now the queen from this day forth. But keep in mind that you have no real power. Do not interfere in any political affairs and obey the prime minister and ministers. You should also know, that the remnants of the royals and royalist nobles from around the country will be investigated and either executed, imprisoned indefinitely, or sent to the mines as criminal slaves’ is what I’ve been tasked to pass along.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? That&#8217;s just too&#8230;umm, miss. Did he say anything else?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha paused for a moment before answering.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. ‘If you don&#8217;t obey, I&#8217;ll just give the crown to someone else, and there’s an alternative, so you would do well not to get carried away’, I believe was it”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative&#8230;he probably meant my younger brother, the young prince.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mariana understood once again that if she made any unnecessary moves, she would be disposed of—killed, imprisoned, or reduced to slavery—just like the rest of the royal family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Please tell Haruto Yuki, no, Master Haruto that I will obey everything he says.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha bowed and walked out of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan reappeared, taking her place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good for you, at least you’re not going to be executed right away. You can thank our boss for that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I suppose, so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She replied so, but Mariana&#8217;s inner thoughts were far from that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she’s been granted a reprieve from sudden death, she was still as good as dead. At the very least, there was no way she could live the same life as before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm, doesn&#8217;t look like you really mean that&#8230;at any rate, we&#8217;ll be watching you at all times, so do yourself a favor and try not to behave strangely. I hope you understand?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan said this as if he could see through Mariana&#8217;s inner thoughts, and disappeared again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And truly as he said, Mariana hadn&#8217;t given up yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she could make contact with the royalist nobles before the investigation reached them, she would have a chance to turn her situation around.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, Mariana came up with a plan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plan to regain her position of power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive that her plan would succeed.</span></p>
