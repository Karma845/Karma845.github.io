<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Military Reinforcement</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after the mock battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had taken the day off to rest, but in the evening, Finne came to my room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, it&#8217;s been almost a month, how are we going to attack Glicente?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as she entered the room and sat down on the chair, I turned my head away from Finne who asked me. Reason being, you know?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne was wearing a thin white negligee. It was quite revealing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I covered my excitement when I invited her into my room, but I couldn&#8217;t look directly at her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;If we attacked head-on with our numbers, we would be outnumbered. But once we sneak into the castle, I think we can handle the rest.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is it really that easy to infiltrate?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, elves are a race that are skilled in magic. And if there&#8217;s one more advantage, it&#8217;s&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Elves are used to moving through trees, they should be able to climb the walls of buildings reasonably well. So, if I were to train them in covert operations&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne didn’t seem to follow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tomorrow we resume training again.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fufu, you look like you&#8217;re having fun.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she said that, I put my hand on my face, and the corners of my mouth had indeed turned up without me noticing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess so. I seem to be enjoying the situation for some reason.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m enjoying watching it too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finne smiled. My heart started to beat faster at the sight of her smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s late. We should probably call it a night.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, trying to remain calm&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah. Can I, uh, s, stay with you, for tonight, if that&#8217;s okay?&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-13484277' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-13484277' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne looked at me with her cheeks flushed and her eyes upturned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is it, not okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I didn’t say it&#8217;s not okay&#8230;can I ask why?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. Um, e, everyone told me to go to bed with Haruto already, you know&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears were welling up in Finne’s eyes. I can&#8217;t refuse this now, can I?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened my mouth with determination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay. It&#8217;s a small bed for one person, is that okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S, sure.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down on the bed alongside Finne, who was blushing more and more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m acting like it&#8217;s nothing, but my heart is racing like crazy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;H, Haruto.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, c, could you please shut your eyes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finne asked with a serious expression on her face as she blushed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did as she asked and closed my eyes. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then——I felt a soft touch and a faint heat on my lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a few seconds, maybe even a few minutes. After what felt like a few seconds or minutes, the feeling left me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;&#8230;Eeh?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I involuntarily let out such a silly sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, on the other hand, sounded dazed and faint.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTI0Nzk1MzU5NTUiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, uh, I&#8217;ve never kissed anyone before, so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At those words, my heart started to pound and the wall of reason came crashing down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I&#8217;m also a man. I need to properly respond to Finne’s feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put up a soundproof barrier in the room so that no one could hear us or come in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I put my hand on her shoulder and gently kissed her small cherry-red lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mmm&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment our lips met, Finne was closing her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then pushed Finne down and fell onto the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Should I, turn off the light?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y, yes&#8230;and, uh, please be gentle with me&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a full moon. With the lights in the room out and the moonlight shining through the window, the shadows of Finne and I overlap.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～ </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——The next morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I woke up and got up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne was sleeping peacefully next to me, looking happy and sound asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mumbling&#8230;I love you, Haruto&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Finne like that, I smiled. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s having a happy dream.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I slipped out of bed and put on my clothes, I muttered to myself, remembering last night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really did it with Finne&#8230;but, is she really okay being with someone like me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down on the bed and gently stroked her head, and she took my hand and held it tightly, as if she would never let go. She adored me and loved me so much. Was it tactless of me to think that way?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then I noticed movement outside the door. Crap, I thought I released the barrier just now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, stop pushing will you!? We’re going to get caught!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Be quiet! I can&#8217;t hear anything now!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I on the other hand can hear you loud and clear!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Kusel! Stop pushing so hard!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not pushing! Whoa!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, the door came open. Or rather, they’re actually barging in!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Mogami, who was at the very front, came into the room, I approached him with ground shrink and gave him a punch in the stomach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a dull thud, Mogami’s eyes rolled back and fainted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t let you see what Finne looks like right now, so forgive me Mogami&#8230;well, you can only blame yourself for barging in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Iris, Suzuno, Kusel, Ephyr, and Asakura, who barged into the room alongside Mogami.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;All right. Let&#8217;s have a little fun before we train, shall we?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five of them took one look at the unconscious Mogami——and shook their heads as best they could.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> They probably realized that it won’t end as just having a little fun.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew you were there last night. Which is why I made a barrier.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris whispered, &#8220;so that&#8217;s why we didn&#8217;t hear anything&#8221;, she muttered regretfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, you&#8217;re just a child, aren&#8217;t you?  Are you old enough to be interested in such things?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see Tendo or Shinonome.  I&#8217;m sure they saw this coming.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that&#8217;s why they went outside to escape&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Asakura told me this, I looked out the window and saw that they were both training together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yawn~&#8230;h, huh? What are you all doing here?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne woke up rubbing her eyes and asked thus , probably still sleepy.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-28679079' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-28679079' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPScyJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI0NjU2ODgwMzY4Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s nothing!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But first, Finne, put your clothes on”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno was blushing, so I tossed the clothes over to Finne.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Finne noticed her outfit and blushed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, uh, uh, mm&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your skin is so shiny.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr muttered as she turned to gaze at her.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Indeed.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kusel nodded her head in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, no, no, this, this is, umm&#8230;Haruto!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne’s face turned even redder, and she finally called out to me for help.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh&#8230;you guys, just get out of here. I&#8217;ll double the training course.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing this, the five of them immediately responded in unison, &#8220;we’re gone!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Kusel pulled the unconscious Mogami by the neck, and the five of them left the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s so noisy early in the morning &#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It sure is.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne’s face was still a little red, but she seemed to be enjoying herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～ </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the day&#8217;s training (which included covert operations) was over, Aegan and the other elves were gathered for a strategy meeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gaining access into the country is easy. The problem is getting into the castle.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The castle, huh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan answered after pondering for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it’s possible——no, definitely possible!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The others nodded at Aegan&#8217;s words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must be proud of the effort they&#8217;ve put in, which is very encouraging.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well said. We need to get the castle under control quickly this time. I will be counting on you guys.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it would be easy for me to overrun the castle by myself, but this is also a revenge mission for the elves. I shouldn’t do this alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes! Leave it to us!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s settled then. I&#8217;ll leave the date and time of the operation to Aegan.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some discussion between Aegan and the others——</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How about we finish the preparations in a week, and go ahead in ten nights?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A night raid. I&#8217;m sure they have tight security at night, but&#8230;I&#8217;m sure these guys can handle it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go with that. But don&#8217;t neglect your training for the duration of the week we have to prepare. If your body slows down, it will affect the battle&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood. We’ve been reminded of that enough.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the end of the meeting for that day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll just do what we can.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～ </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next week, we continued to train, as there was nothing special to prepare.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was the one who grew the most during the past month of training.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>NAME: </b></p></td><td><p><b>Iris Arclaidh Perdis</b></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-52538660' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-52538660' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>LEVEL: </b></p></td><td><p><b>31</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>AGE: </b></p></td><td><p><b>14</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>SPECIES: </b></p></td><td><p><b>Human</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>UNIQUE SKILLS: </b></p></td><td><p><b>Gale Rush</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>SKILLS: </b></p></td><td><p><b>Sword Arts Lv5</b></p><p><b>Physical Boost Lv5</b></p><p><b>Lightning Magic Lv4</b></p><p><b>Wind Magic Lv4</b></p><p><b>Dual Wielding Lv4</b></p><p><b>Social Etiquette* Lv8</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>TITLES: </b></p></td><td><p><b>First Princess of the Perdis Kingdom</b></p><p><b>Haruto&#8217;s Fiancee</b></p><p><b>Unique Skill User</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s even stronger than Tendo and the others at the time we reunited.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t even imagine my classmates other than Tendo and his friends—the other heroes are any stronger, in fact, she can even take on two heroes at once with these.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She used to be reluctant when I invited her to mock battles, but now Iris is the one proactively inviting me. I can only hope that she doesn’t become a musclehead like Kusel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she saw me using the dual-wielding skill, she said, &#8220;I would like to dual wield too!”, so I taught it to her, and she acquired the skill in a short time.

How can you deflect a magic sword with your bare hands?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s what you call ability.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn it! I&#8217;m going to be serious this time! I won&#8217;t stop even if you beg me to!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What? Is she perhaps? Angry?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A storm blew, and Iris was covered in lightning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, a sword was right in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I fended it off not with my beloved sword, but just an iron sword that I pulled out on the spur of the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How are you able to parry that with just an iron sword?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe I’m just that good?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, I&#8217;ve strengthened the sword by pouring a huge amount of magic power into it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris swung her sword at full speed, but I blocked all of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmmm. You’re getting more accurate, but there&#8217;s still a lot of unnecessary movement&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I tuned up my sword speed as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No way&#8230;why are you suddenly so fast?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, this is what happens when I get a little serious myself. I mean, I&#8217;m not even using a physical boost right now&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, Iris&#8217;s movements stopped, but only for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Eh?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took advantage of the moment and stabbed my sword towards her neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And, It&#8217;s over. But you&#8217;re stronger than before, that’s for sure.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Were you being serious when you said you didn’t use a physical boost?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I was.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was shocked, but then she returned to her usual bullish expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T, then I&#8217;ll make you use it next time!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let’s see. Guess I’ll be looking forward to it then.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I patted Iris on the head and smiled.</span></p>
