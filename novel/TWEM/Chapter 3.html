<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Special Training Session</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a week after that, we stopped by a few towns and arrived at a town that was only two days away from the Tonitia Forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our destination, the Elven village, was just around the corner, so we decided to each take a rest as we pleased later in the day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was working out in the yard of the inn, Finne, Suzuno, Shinonome, and Kusel came over. The four of them had also come to train.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, would you mind sparring with me for a bit?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as soon as Finne arrived she made such a request.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no reason to refuse, so I gladly accepted, and after sparring for a while, I realized something.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? Finne, it appears that you’re moving better than before.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh, ahh, I, see?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, keep it up!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh really? Thank you very much!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After catching her breath, Finne broke into a smile at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Kusel saw us, she called out to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, I&#8217;d like you to spar with me too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusel, you too?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. When I saw the two of you sparring earlier, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a burning sensation welling up in my chest! ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, okay&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving into the momentum, I decided to spar with Kusel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, Kusel is a former vice knight captain and an A-rank adventurer. She’s fairly strong.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be a little interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess I’ll be observing from here then!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne then sat down next to Suzuno and Shinonome, who had been observing from earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Kusel and I began sparring.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to admit, Kusel&#8217;s ability was quite impressive, and if I were to let my guard down, she’s likely to get a clean hit in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the spar was coming to a close, I was sweating for the first time in a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne brought a towel and a cup to me and Kusel, who was out of breath.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-59468833' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-59468833' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well done, you two. I brought you some towels and drinks.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks Finne.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I appreciate it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was wiping off my sweat and gulping down my drink vigorously, I heard Suzuno and Shinonome talking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That level of movement is still impossible for us, I think&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess. But we have to be able to do that someday.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’re right, so if I try hard enough, will I be able to?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. Sure you can.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll do my best then!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I watched them having such a heartwarming conversation, I cheered for them in my heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the next day, we left the city.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some monsters appeared along the way, but Kusel, Tendo, and the others took the initiative before I could make a move, so I hardly had to.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since they were off to battle before I could alert them, all I had to do was hold the reins.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yawwwn~&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that was the state of things, I couldn’t help but yawn after having lunch and continued on our way.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to Kusel, who was sitting in the passenger seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusel, I need to get some sleep, can you take over? I&#8217;m feeling sleepy&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, of course. Take your time.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks a bunch. Maguro is smart, so he’s able to understand almost any oral command.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After handing over the reins to Kusel, I lay down on the bench in the back of the carriage instead of entering the subspace so that I could deal with any problems that might arise.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pleasant breeze, the warm sunlight, and the rattling and comfortable swaying of the carriage made me lose myself in sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yawn~&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I slowly opened my eyes, the sun was already starting to set, and the sky I saw through the carriage window was tinged with red.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTI5ODE2NTQ1OTUiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see you’re finally awake. Haruto, that’s one deep sleep, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked up at the sound of the voice and saw Finne peering into my face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Hmm? And I feel something soft behind my head&#8230;is this what they call a lap pillow?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne&#8217;s lustrous silver hair reflected the setting sun, giving it an orange sheen. Some kind of soft scent tickled my nose. I would like to just close my eyes like this, but&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finne, how long have I been asleep?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s about four hours.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that I slept for quite a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still longed for Finne’s lap pillow, but I better get up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, around the corner of my eyes, Iris and Suzuno looked envious. I&#8217;m sure they would ask me to sleep on their lap soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. Any changes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Nothing in particular&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne answers me, looking regretfully at me as I get up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s all good then&#8230;&#8230;oh that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then whispered in Finne’s ear.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I look forward to this again, just the both of us.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ohh!? Ye, yes&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then, we should probably find a place to set up camp for the day.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ye, yes&#8230;&#8230;you’re, right.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne’s face was tinged with a hint of red. And Iris and Suzuno&#8217;s gazes hurt, but I decided not to worry about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, I found a place that looked like a good place to camp, so I called out to Kusel, who was acting as the coachman, to stop the carriage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to quickly prepare dinner when Iris raised her hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will do the cooking today!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What? Iris to cook? Even though she’s never mentioned anything like that before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, to begin with&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iris, can you cook?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of, of course I can cook!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris insists, puffing her flat chest, but I remember hearing from Iris&#8217; father, King Dillan of Perdis, before we left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day before departure, Haruto was summoned by Dillan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Haruto, would you do me a favor and teach Iris how to cook?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Dillan bowed his head saying that, as soon as Haruto arrived.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What’s this about cooking all of a sudden?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Haruto’s reasonable question, Dillan began to tremble with his hands holding his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tru, truth is, Iris has cooked for me before.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, what did she make?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was an omelet. Just——&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that as a preamble, Dillan began to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year ago, Iris appeared in Dillan&#8217;s room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Daddy! I made you an omelet! Try it! ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ooh? Iris&#8217;s home cooking huh? Let me have a taste——&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan, who received the plate saying that, became speechless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason was that what was on the plate was a dark object–– charcoal in the shape of an omelet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Dillan felt a purple aura coming off of it, and he broke out in a cold sweat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I, is this an omelet?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! I messed up a little, though.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This thing isn’t on a level you would call &#8220;a little&#8221; is it!?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppressing the urge to scream, Dillan looked at his wife, Amalia, but she just smiled and said: &#8220;Oh my, oh my.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, he looked at Asha who was following Iris, she just bowed her head saying, &#8220;Your Majesty, I said to her ‘it would be better to taste it out yourself first.'&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-53474818' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-53474818' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that no one could help him, Dillan prepared himself and took a slice into his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he bit into the omelet (?), it made a crunchy sound, just like it looked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the next moment, Dillan fell on his back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Daddy!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dear!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Majesty!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Amalia, and Asha rushed over to Dillan who suddenly collapsed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Daddy! What’s going on!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My, my dear Iris&#8230;, coo, cooking is such, a profound, art, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan summoned his last strength and lost consciousness, leaving behind those words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Daddy!? Daddy———!”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris&#8217;s cry echoed fruitlessly in Dillan&#8217;s room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——And that’s what happened. By the way, I couldn&#8217;t get up the next day.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Se, seriously?&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillan seemed so exhausted, and Haruto could only reply thus.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; Yup, I can’t let Iris cook.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Asha, can I have a word?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to Asha, whose face was turning pale.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha, Haruto, you have to stop the princess! If you don’t, we’ll all&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ca, calm down Asha! ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can I stay calm!? That thing, that thing can only be called poison&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From her manner of speaking, I wonder if Asha has also been made to eat her cooking before?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah I already heard the gist from Dillan. This is why I want Asha to assist Iris. You can ask someone else to help if you need to! I beg you!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh! ? M-Me?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I beg you!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed my head as best I could. Because I don&#8217;t want to see my friends fall at the hands of Iris.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay. I’ll do it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha looked distressed but accepted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it that bad that you’d rather not even assist?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Dillan’s story and Asha&#8217;s reaction, if we were to describe Iris&#8217; cooking ability in terms of skill level, it would be described as negative.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we moved to the kitchen in the subspace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they were to cook with the equipment outside, they wouldn’t be able to control the fire, and would just turn to charcoal in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, this kitchen is a reproduction of the Japanese system kitchen, so it even has a stove and an oven. I can make anything with magic power, so anything is possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others told me I was overdoing it, but oh well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I decided to keep an eye on Iris as she stood in the kitchen with Asha.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Asha, what should I cook?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230;how about a pancake?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure she chose something easy that even Iris could make. There is also the question of whether pancakes can pass for dinner, but that’s only if they don’t turn to charcoal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, as to Iris’ reaction to the idea of making pancakes-</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m good at cooking with eggs!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or so she says in a proud tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hell you are! Or so I was about to say, but I don’t want to get in trouble by saying something unnecessary to make her sulk, so I held myself back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha twitched her cheeks implying &#8220;is that so?&#8221;, but she didn&#8217;t seem keen on saying anything beyond that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, do you know the ingredients for pancakes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ingredients? That&#8217;s easy. Haruto already taught me! Just eggs, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wrong!

Asha brilliantly ignores it and continues with the cooking.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here, you separate the yolks from the whites, and add only the whites first.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why not break them in together?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it is a kind of technique. Just keep watching.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha said that and began quickly mixing the egg whites in a bowl with a whisk.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris panicked when she saw the egg whites starting to foam.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See, it&#8217;s foaming! Asha, you’re mixing too much!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please calm down. This is called meringue. Once the meringue is done, add the yolks and sugar to the bowl of flour and milk and mix again.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, so it’s called meringue&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris seemed curious, and Asha got angry at her for trying to poke the meringue.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess, don&#8217;t you want Haruto to have a delicious meal? If you don&#8217;t listen carefully, it won’t taste delicious, now will it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s not true! I want Haruto to be happy while eating my food!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I will be happy to eat it, as long as it doesn’t come out as charcoal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, having heard Dillan’s story, I guess I can&#8217;t help but feel uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If that’s the case, then make sure to learn it properly.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha said and resumed her explanation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finally, add the meringue and mix until blended. At this point, be careful not to mix too much or the meringue will be crushed.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Do you understand?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris replied cheerfully, but Asha still looked uneasy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was probably worried about whether Iris had learned the procedure well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I don&#8217;t see the reason why she needs to worry that much, as long as she watches her carefully and puts her through the process.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All that is left now is to just bake it. Put a ladleful of the batter into a hot pan with oil. If you don&#8217;t keep the heat low at this time, only the surface will burn. Then leave it for a while.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few tens of seconds later. Bubbles began to appear on the surface.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you see bubbles coming out of the dough, check the back of the dough with a spatula. &#8230;If the dough is light-browned, it&#8217;s fine. Keep a close eye on it, okay?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O, okay!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha turns over the dough as Iris stares at her with a nervous expression.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she baked the other half, transferred it to a plate, and poured butter and honey over it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s done. What do you think? Easy right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;R, right!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris stared at the freshly made pancakes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her, Asha smiles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why not go ahead and try it.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you sure!? Thank you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris replied ready to dig in, put her hands together and said &#8220;Bon Appetit!”, and then cut a slice of the pancake into a mouthful size.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then happily carried it to her mouth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, delicious! It&#8217;s so fluffy, and the honey goes really well with it.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-76445027' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-76445027' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will ask the princess to make the same thing.

(TLN: Soggy sound)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn&#8217;t turn out so well, and the dough lost its shape on the edge of the pan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah. Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was shocked, but Asha quickly followed up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s usually like this at first. You just have to get better and better at it.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;R, right!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the pancakes turned out ugly, but Iris didn&#8217;t let that stop her from frying them one after another.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, by the time she had baked enough for the entire number of people, she never got it right, but in the second half, she was able to turn it over reasonably neatly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s done! What do you think, Asha?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well done, princess. It&#8217;s not perfect yet, but I think you&#8217;ve improved a lot!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“Of course!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha replied with a smile, and Iris puffed out her chest with a smug look on her face.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">W, well, she did give her best. And not a single one turned into charcoal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Hey, guys, it&#8217;s ready! They’re a little awkward, but they should taste good!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We put enough pancakes for everyone on plates and left the subspace.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we all sat down at the table, but for some reason, no one wanted to touch it, and they all looked at me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you eating?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha answers my question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The princess would like Haruto to eat it first. Since she’s your fiance&#8230;&#8230; and as for us, we thought Haruto is sturdy enough to handle it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Wait a minute! That last part, I’m just a taster for poison, aren’t I?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, at least the first part, that I understand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris was also waiting for me to eat with sparkling eyes. Aww, she&#8217;s too damn cute!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I willed myself to a mouthful of a piece taken from the pancake in front of me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Munch munch, gulp&#8230;hmm, it&#8217;s really good. The inside is fluffy and very tasty.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not flattery, it was really delicious. Even if it&#8217;s a little ugly, I wouldn’t mind if I cut it into bite-sized pieces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris&#8217; cheeks turned a little red and she said, &#8220;th, thank you.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make you some more next time,&#8221; putting her hands on her pancake as if to hide her embarrassment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, everyone started to eat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the comments that came out were along the line of “delicious,&#8221; and Iris&#8217; cheeks colored with happiness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Dillan had been here, he would have cried in joy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus the idyllic night passed.</span></p>
