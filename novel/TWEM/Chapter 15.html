<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Mock Battle</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—The next day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was in the conference room early in the morning, receiving reports from the Prime Minister and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s all just between yesterday and today, so there was nothing unusual.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that the officials were happy to accept the change of ministers and the change of system along with the death of the king.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Wow, the royal family was really this loathed? I guess it was only a matter of time even if I hadn’t made a move personally.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve heard that there have been some suspicious movements by some of the royalist factions, but the reforms seemed to be going well for the most part.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Now then, what should I do for today?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reforms are proceeding smoothly, but I&#8217;m not going to interfere in every little detail. I&#8217;ll check the results, but that&#8217;s about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why I immediately had some free time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was strolling around the castle in a daze with Finne and Iris, I happened to pass by my classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These guys are Daigoro Azuma, Masato Suzuki, and Kazuma Konoe. They are known as the Idiot Trio.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa, Yuki. If you&#8217;re free, why don&#8217;t we have a mock battle?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yea come on. You know, to test our abilities and all.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re just thinking of getting some physical exercises going, you know.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, a mock battle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I haven&#8217;t seen with my own eyes the abilities of the heroes other than Tendo and the others, so I&#8217;d like to check them out while I can.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay. Let&#8217;s do this. You gotta move your body once in a while right.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now we talkin’! The venue is the training ground in the royal castle, so come right away!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the three idiots ran off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or we could just go now together&#8230;were my thoughts, but when I arrived at the training ground, I found that all the heroes except Ms. Usami were present.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTE5NDc5MjMyNDciIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those twats, so they pulled that stunt on everyone else huh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glifas and the knights, who were using the training ground, looked around at the heroes as if to say, what&#8217;s going on?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when Glifas found Tendo, he called out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here, Mister Tendo? Pretty much all the heroes are assembled here in full force.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while, sir Glifas. We’re thinking of having a little mock battle.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. We’re just about rounding up, so feel free to use the place as you see fit. And if I may observe, if you don’t mind?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, of course.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What? So the Knight Order is going to be watching too?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sweet. All right, boys. Today&#8217;s training is over! I just heard that the heroes are going to be having a mock battle, so how about we observe ‘em boys!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights cheered at Glifas&#8217; words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, by the way, Haruto is also here&#8230;over there, see, seems like he just arrived.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, so I get to see how Mister Haruto fights with my own eyes! I&#8217;m so looking forward to it, Mister Haruto!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Could you please stop raising the difficulty as you please, geez?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled briskly and headed for the center of the training area with Tendo and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So what&#8217;s the plan? We were actually planning to have a mock battle with each group or party, but&#8230;now that Yuki is here, why don&#8217;t we make it one-on-one?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook my head at Azuma&#8217;s words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, it&#8217;s me versus your whole party. Bring it on, give it everything you&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa, whoa, we&#8217;re heroes too, okay? I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re an EX rank or whatever&#8230;right Tendo?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki said this and looked at Tendo.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He must have thought that Tendo, who had been with me, could be trusted to back him up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not only Tendo, but Mogami, Suzuno and the rest of Tendo&#8217;s party all shook their heads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hate to break it to you. But, we’ve had our share of one vs five, and we gave it our all, but&#8230;”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-11723552' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-11723552' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were toyed with each time.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can say that again&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moreover, he wasn’t even trying.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just forget it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All five of them had distant looks on their faces as if they were trying to escape reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuki and the others, on the other hand, were buzzing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? Your party was the strongest of us all though.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you kidding me?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case, wouldn’t a one-on-one be hopeless then.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of them had given up completely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, don&#8217;t just give up before you’re certain of your opponent’s strength&#8230; With this in mind, I checked the status of the heroes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm, they&#8217;re not as strong as Tendo and the others whom I trained personally, but they&#8217;re stronger than most adventurers, I guess.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not many noteworthy gifts, but a significant portion of them seem pretty powerful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, they seem to have rallied themselves in units of a few people since coming to this training ground, but they’re probably working together in parties. With that in mind, I took a look at the gifts and found a few parties that were pretty well balanced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Good, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll get stronger and stronger as they work together and level up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the level of the Four Heavenly Kings of the Demon King&#8217;s Army that I defeated, Gheel, was over 130.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this rate, it will take a long time before they can defeat the Four Heavenly Kings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sighing at my classmates who were still buzzing about me, I asked in a provocative manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;So, are we doing this or what? Don’t tell me you’re having second thoughts now because you’re scared shitless, right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Of course not!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goddamn right!

Well then, who wants to go first?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I looked around and saw Mitsurugi, Suruga, and Matsuba stepping forward with grins on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you start with us? Or are you afraid of losing?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huh, they even dare to come out here too?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their pitiful statuses, I don&#8217;t think they are even a match for Tendo and the others much less me&#8230;moreover, were they deaf to what was being said earlier?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I kept quiet, thinking about what to do, Mitsurugi got even more audacious.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, hey, hey, you&#8217;ve finally gone mute. Aren&#8217;t you supposed to be a badass?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well you can never tell with this guy, everything could all be bogus.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So true.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Mitsurugi and the others laughed, Finne, who had been listening in silence until then, raised her voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You guys! What exactly is your deal?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drop it, Finne”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a waste of time dealing with this trash.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll just knock ‘em out in a flash and be done with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was my train of thought, but—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure you&#8217;re probably using magic or whatever to control that lady over there, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Otherwise, why would anyone accompany you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kukukuu, got that right. I mean, you were never even popular back in school”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did they even wind up with that idea? As I was dumbfounded, Iris started to lose her temper.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-86847580' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-86847580' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haruto would never do such a thing!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iris, don’t. That’s just the kind of trash they are.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said this and showed a deliberate sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The hell?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you looking down on us?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get carried away!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, the three of them turned red and started yelling at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s you guys who are looking down on me and getting carried away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;But It&#8217;s all good. I&#8217;ll deal with you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Heh, you’ll regret it later!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re gonna beat the shit out of you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You better not bawl your eyes out while showing your pathetic figure to everyone!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, yes. Wow, I’m actually surprised these guys can cough up words like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, Glifas, can you give the signal to start?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm? Yeah, I don’t mind.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glifas, who had been looking at Mitsurugi and the others with a dumbfounded look, nodded at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Finne and company with the other heroes retreated, and I, Mitsurugi, Suruga, and Matsuba faced each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them were full of motivation. I&#8217;m sure their heads are filled with thoughts of humiliating me&#8230;would probably be more productive directing that motivation to do something else.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You guys ready—and begin!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Glifas’ signal, the mock battle began.</span></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the start signal was given, the three directed their bloodlust at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, rather than just trying to beat me up, it’s more like they&#8217;re trying to murder me&#8230;well, it’s still nothing more than a soft breeze though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Suruga turned his palm toward me and unleashed his magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Fireball!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, as expected, it lacks firepower all right. Is he trying to get a feel of the situation or could it be, that’s actually his best shot&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I returned with fireball magic with no chant to cancel it out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““No Chant?”””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them let out a cry of surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, anybody can cast elementary magic with no chant, right? &#8230;wait, don’t tell me, could it be that, you can&#8217;t?

If magic doesn&#8217;t work, then close combat will! Come on!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Got it!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsurugi and Matsuba brandished their swords, while Suruga held his spear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in formation, the three of them attacked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first one to attack me was Suruga. He unleashed a series of thrusts in an attempt to skewer me, but&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too slow, way too slow. It&#8217;s so slow that it’s practically stationary, to be honest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not using any physical boosting skill whatsoever, and yet this&#8230;well, I suppose it’s to be expected when the level difference is almost tenfold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Mitsurigi and Matsuba’s swords slashing at me from the side, didn’t even come close.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How come, how come my attacks aren’t connecting? What skill are you using? Tell me!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga shouted in frustration at the lack of any of his attacks hitting me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why, you ask&#8230;you&#8217;re just too slow.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Fuckin’! Sunnava! Take this—Gale Thrust!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Suruga chanted the name of the technique, the wind wrapped around the spear and the speed of the thrust became a little faster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Oh, I guess it has become a teeny weeny bit faster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I easily avoided it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the&#8230;? How could you have avoided that blow&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga said, with a look of despair emerging on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, could that perhaps have been his strongest technique? No friggin’ way? Seriously?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was getting upset at the sheer lack of skill, Mitsurugi rushed in.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTQ3Njg3MDg2MjEiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gotcha!

It&#8217;s a burning sword accelerated by a skill you know!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It didn&#8217;t have much firepower, and the attack itself wasn&#8217;t that strong&#8230;don’t tell me it’s a special move or something similar?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, I&#8217;m not trying to stir things up or anything, I&#8217;m just wondering&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps he didn&#8217;t like my reaction, Mitsurugi snapped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t fuck with me!!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsurugi took his hand off his sword and struck me with his fist clad in lightning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, so you wield three attributes&#8230;too bad, you’re still a ways off.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind, fire, and lightning, he seemed to possess some talent, and if trained well, could become reasonably strong&#8230;but for now, his fist is just too slow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I flicked it lightly, and Mitsurugi shouted in surprise, but I ignored him and stepped back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, Matsuba&#8217;s sword passed by where I was.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did you notice?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your presence, dimwit. Conceal yourself better.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said that and lightly kicked Matsuba and Mitsurugi together.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, the three of them tried desperately to attack me, but their attacks didn&#8217;t even graze my clothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three were breathing hard, and I asked them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you done? In that case, I guess it’s my turn.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I said that, I invoked my intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-What the, hell is this&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My body, feels so heavy&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them took a step or two backwards from the pressure I was putting on them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here I come”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said that and made a move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Guaahh!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in an instant, I closed the distance and kicked Matsuba away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—!

Oops.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha-. Where’d he go?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Behind maybe?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga must have looked back on a hunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was already standing at a distance from the two of them—holding a spear in my hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? You want to have a go at me with a spear?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I replied to Suruga&#8217;s words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why not. I’ll have you know, I possess Spear Arts skills as well.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Get off your fuckin’ high horse goddamnit!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps his pride got the better of him, but Suruga&#8217;s voice was filled with anger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait, Hayato!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave it to me, I&#8217;m the one with the advantage when it comes to spears! I&#8217;m going to beat the living daylights out of that braggart!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without heeding to Mitsurugi’s call for composure, Suruga readied his spear and lunged at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I dare you, take on my special move!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure, bring it on.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, he still had a special move up his sleeve huh? Interesting, all right, show me what you got.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no stopping it now, just so you know!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah whatever, hurry it up”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t tell me, he wants me to beg him to stop?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Argh, acting all smug!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga put magic power into his spear, and finally closed the distance between us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Special Move, Explosive Spear Frenzy!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic power contained in the spear tip gathered as it rushed forward from the accumulated momentum.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the moment the magic power reached the tip, it exploded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as the name &#8220;Frenzy&#8221; implies, the spear was launched repeatedly, and each time the magic power at the tip of the spear exploded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not too shabby.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, I parried every thrust with my spear, deflecting their trajectories.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How come, how am I unable to land a single hit? How are you able to parry an attack of this speed?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I replied to Suruga who was exclaiming in frustration.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the difference in our combat experience and level. From my point of view, your attacks practically appear motionless to me—simply put, you still have quite a ways to go.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I flicked Suruga&#8217;s spear wide.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Watch carefully! This is how you wield a spear.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then unleashed a series of thrusts at Suruga, who had lost his balance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga managed to block the thrusts with the spear he held in his hand, but his spear was flicked away after a couple of thrusts.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-52212595' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-52212595' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, a single vivid line colored in blood ran down his cheek.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Ouch, hieek!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga let out a pathetic scream as my spear stopped next to his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;ve lost, now be quiet.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga nodded at my words, but then Mitsurugi came slashing at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re not done yet!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked while parrying his sword with my spear.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How are you going to continue fighting in this situation having lost your spear?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up! Our bare hands alone are more than enough for the likes of you, right Hayato?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Yeah!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huh, he’s still spouting such nonsense at this stage, sheesh, what a royal pain in the ass.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you don’t say. In that case—&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went straight to hit Suruga in the gut with my spear. Of course, not with the tip, but with the butt end.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga moaned and collapsed on the spot, passing out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Should’ve known you wouldn’t shed a tear until you saw the coffin!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitsurugi saw Suruga pass out, he glared at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, whoa. This is a mock battle, is it not? So, don&#8217;t glare at me like that.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you&#8217;re the one who came at me, sheesh, talk about being unreasonable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsurugi shouted like a spoiled brat and increased his magic power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, fool. You wanna drag everyone here into this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to stop him, but Mitsurugi wouldn&#8217;t listen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up! If only, if only you would just disappear! —Explosion!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Mitsurugi shouted the spell name, a mass of compressed flames appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess a hero is still a hero huh, even one as trashy as he is, because judging from the magic power output, it looks pretty powerful. Enough to blow up this whole training ground, I guess?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, it still won&#8217;t do any damage to me though&#8230;I don&#8217;t know about the rest of the heroes, but there are knights and others present here as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;guess there’s no helping it—Aegis.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed and wrapped the huge fireball that was about to explode with a barrier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic was activated immediately afterwards, but it did not destroy the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsurugi was stunned when I easily nullified the attack he had unleashed with all his might.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, way&#8230;no way, no way, no friggin’ way! An incompetent like you, there&#8217;s absolutely no way you could have prevented—”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would you shut your trap?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Hieek?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said that in a low voice, Mitsurugi let out a scream and backed away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsuba and Suruga, who seemed to have come a while ago, came running up to Mitsurugi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey Kento, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey Yuki, we&#8217;re back in the game now. So let’s contin—!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsuba didn&#8217;t seem to have learned his lesson, and tried glaring at me, while saying that&#8230;then he choked on his words.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-86371914' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-86371914' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was because I had invoked intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked up to Mitsurugi slowly and asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, Mitsurugi.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-W-What, what is it?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did you use that spell? If I hadn&#8217;t prevented it, you know very well the damage it would have done to everyone.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;T-That’s&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsurugi cast his eyes down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you&#8217;d caused a single scratch to any of my friends, I&#8217;d have killed you with my own hands.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, to be honest, I think Finne and the others could have easily avoided it anyway.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Killing&#8230;come now, we&#8217;re your classmates, aren&#8217;t we?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Yes, we are!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matsuba and Suruga interrupted me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You two, shut it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Hieek!””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I glared at them lightly and they instantly quieted down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignoring the two, I spoke to Mitsurugi.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Classmate or not, I will show no mercy. Any lowlife who dares to put my friends in danger—I’ll kill ‘em.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere in the training area became tense, and the sound of someone clearing their throat could be heard from afar.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut you some slack this time, but don&#8217;t get carried away just because you&#8217;re a hero. Next time you try something funny.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then increased the intimidation a notch further.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Make no mistake, I will end you. Consider this your final warning.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the three of them could no longer withstand the intimidation, and they passed out under the pressure.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had not directed any of the intimidation at the audience, but they must have perceived the pressure I was giving off, because for some reason, they all looked kind of pale.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to Glifas to handle the three of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Glifas&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey Glifas. Can you hear me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to him again, Glifas responded as if he just came to.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh, yea, yeah, of course. Thanks for stepping in to stop that just now”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t worry about it&#8230;I should be the one apologizing for the reckless conduct.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nah, I&#8217;m just glad there was no damage.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gave the instructions to Glifas, who seemed relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, could you toss these three in the underground prison? I&#8217;d like to give them some time to reflect on their actions&#8230;they probably didn’t see anything wrong with their conduct, I’d bet?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tell me about it. They’ve apparently been doing whatever they wanted relying on their status as heroes. I&#8217;ve been getting complaints from all over the place, churning my brains out as to what to do.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, then I guess this is an opportunity&#8230;or what do you think? Anyway, just take care of these guys, okay.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I got it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glifas then ordered his knight to take the three of them to the prison.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing them off, I turned to the others and started over.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Well then, shall we resume the mock battle? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not going to beat you guys up like I did those misfits. So let&#8217;s just have a fun time.&#8221;</span></p>
