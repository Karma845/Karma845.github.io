<h3>Chapter 1 – Departure from the Perdis Kingdom</h3>

<p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, Haruto Yuuki, a high school student, was suddenly summoned as a hero to another world together with my whole class. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after checking our status, it was found out that I did not have the title of 『Hero』, nor did I receive a 『Gift』 that is usually bestowed to all heroes. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I was driven out by Mariana, the princess of the Glicente Kingdom responsible for the summoning, and almost got done in by her knights, but then a god appeared before me. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an apology for forgetting to give me a Gift, I received some cheat skills, such as All Creation, which allows me to create all sorts of skills, God Eye, which lets me see through anything, and many more. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I vowed to one day take my revenge on the Glicente Kingdom, and decided to work as an adventurer while looking for a way to go back to my original world. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having relocated to the neighboring Perdis Kingdom, I was awarded the world’s highest adventurer rank, the unprecedented 『EX』 rank, for my efforts in preventing the destruction of the royal capital by a massive outbreak of monsters. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I received a mansion as a reward and began living there with a fellow adventurer Finne, the first princess of the Perdis Kingdom Iris, her attendant Asha, and the newly hired butler and maids. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, I rescued an elf, Ephyr, from a slave merchant, and learned that her hometown, the Elven Village, had been invaded by the Glicente Kingdom. </span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-22302149' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-22302149' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byIKICAgICBkYXRhLWZ1bGwtd2lkdGgtcmVzcG9uc2l2ZT0idHJ1ZSI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After reuniting with my former classmates, the heroes, and bringing them into my party, I decided to leave the Perdis Kingdom for the Elven Village and Glicente royal capital. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The morning of our departure had finally come. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright then, Sebas, Lyla, Mia, we’re off now.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood, please take care on your way.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Please take care.”” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting on the coachman’s seat of the horse-drawn carriage, I called out to Sebas, the butler, and the maids, Lyla and Mia who are currently employed at the mansion. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne, who was already sitting on the coachman’s seat a little earlier, also lowered her head briefly towards them. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hoot hoot, let’s get going, Maguro!” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I called out, my favorite horse, Maguro, neighed as he pulled the cart. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTU4NDMyMDczODEiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, Asha, Ephyr are accompanying me on this journey, as well as my former classmates Suzuno Ichinomiya, Koji Tendo, Shinya Mogami, Aoi Shinonome, and Natsuki Asakura, all of whom I have already asked to ride in the back of the carriage. Incidentally, I have decided to drop all formalities and call Shinonome and Asakura by their first names starting from this journey. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are quite a large group, and we also have cargo to load on the back of the carriage, but on the other hand, the carriage isn’t exactly big enough to accommodate eight people. So, a certain amount of cargo and a few people are carried in the back, and the rest in the subspace that connects through the wall in the back. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Subspace』 is like another world that I created with my immense magic power and space-time magic, and within it lies a vast grassland and a splendid house. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone but Finne was amazed by the subspace their first time in and impressed by its comfort. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had made sure that a few of us stayed in the back of the carriage so that we wouldn’t draw suspicion in case something happened, although the methods used to determine those who are to stay in the back were a sight to behold. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, our new journey began smoothly. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ephyr&#8217;s information, the elven village is in the Tonitia Forest. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tonitia Forest, known as “Sea of Trees”, is located on the border between the Perdis Kingdom and the Glicente Kingdom, and can be reached by going south from the Perdis royal capital, where we are now, and then proceeding west along the border. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s about a week to the forest, and we were in no particular hurry, so I steadily advanced the horse-drawn carriage while chatting with Finne. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Maguro is smart to begin with, so I don’t even have to steer him. He is a very reliable companion who thinks and acts for himself and listens to what I say. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, the sun had risen right overhead, so I decided to pull up the carriage at the edge of the road so we could have lunch. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I have no plans to make anything fancy, just simple bread and soup. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked everyone out of the subspace and proceeded with the preparation. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and I, who are accustomed to traveling, and Ephyr, who lived in the forest, were leading the preparation, but surprisingly, Tendo and the other heroes were also moving rather adeptly. Well, I suppose they must have experienced quite a few trips before making their way to Perdis. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Iris and Asha, in that regard&#8230;I guess I’ll have them get used to it on this trip too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I gave Maguro a heap of vegetables and fruits for his hard work, and also got myself some bread and soup. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bread was baked by Lyla, and for the soup, we decided to go with corn soup to go with the bread. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there are a lot of us on this trip, it’s not a whole meal, but I have stored the foods made in advance back at the mansion in my dimensional storage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bread and soup are still steaming hot and warm as if they were freshly made, thanks to the dimensional storage where time does not elapse. </span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-20958072' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-20958072' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expressed our gratitude to Lyla and devoured the meal in a flash. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We resumed our journey, and after a while, I checked the map with God Eye and detected a reaction that seemed like an enemy a little bit ahead. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around fifteen of them. They are working together in such large numbers and seemed to be well placed, so they must be human bandits, not monsters. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; Doesn’t it seem like I almost always encounter bandits every time I go on a trip? Or is it just my imagination? </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we are outnumbered, but with this group, we should have no problem whatsoever. Just consider yourselves shit out of luck the moment you decide to target us. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At any rate, I communicated the situation to Tendo and Suzuno in the back of the carriage that bandits were lying in wait a little further ahead, and told them to tell everyone in the subspace. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as we rode the carriage to that point, we saw a tree had fallen to block the road.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maguro stop!” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Maguro came to a stop at my command, five bandits appeared from the grass on both sides of the fallen tree. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I could see on the map, the rest of the bandits seem to be circling to the sides and behind us. They probably intend to have us surrounded, talk about the obvious. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehehehe. Hey kid, you won’t be going any further from here. If you want to go through, you’ll have to leave your carriage and all your stuff behind.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “That woman over there, and the others if there are any, stay too!” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You got that right! Gyaahahahaha!” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do all bandits learn from the same teacher or something, how come they always recite similar lines?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…that aside. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Where are your weapons? And did you wipe your mouths properly? You’ve got something on you.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing my words, the bandits froze, looking at each other. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup. These dolts didn&#8217;t have any weapons. Not only that, but they had stains around their mouths like a sauce, as if they were just eating a minute ago. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bandits remained frozen for a few seconds, but then, as if in panic, they went back into the grass and came out again with weapons in their hands. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-14988727' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-14988727' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, they’ve wiped their mouths too. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehehehe.

Finne also got off the coachman&#8217;s seat and stood beside me. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bandits gave Finne and Suzuno a vulgar look, as if they were assessing them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tendo, what about the others?” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm? They’re asleep on the couch. Tried waking them, but they wouldn’t get up, so I let them be&#8230;” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at a time like this, what a carefree bunch. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So&#8230;guys, you think you can take ‘em?” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Tendo and Suzuno, hinting at the bandits. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I still haven’t, resolved myself to murder&#8230;” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too, I guess.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. I won’t force you to kill anyone.

Because I need them to cough up the location of their hideout and the rest of their crew. And it’s not like I go around killing people proactively either. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if I let these two who aren’t accustomed to PvP battles fight, there is a possibility that their opponents might die by accident. When I thought of that… I opted to confirm, in case such a thing were to happen while they have yet to steel their resolve. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like the two of them were reading too much into it, and were at odds over the assumption that they would kill their opponents, but in any case, it’s probably best not to let them fight. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Tendo and Suzuno return to the back of the carriage, I turned to Finne.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finne, would you mind staying back and guarding the back of the carriage? I can handle this lot on my own, but just in case.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright, I&#8217;ll leave the enemy to you.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne nodded and moved to the back of the carriage. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With neither Suzuno nor Finne in-sight, the bandits in front of me became rowdy with disgruntled remarks. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did they go back now~” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But still, they&#8217;re both high quality!” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You bet, even the boss will be delighted with these!” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After we’ve sampled them first, right?” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You, you’re such a genius!?” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the bandits all laughed vulgarly Gyaahahaha. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, these guys really are beyond saving&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To begin with, the fact that they looked at Finne and Suzuno with such disgusting eyes already ticked me off. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed and glared at the bandits.</span></p>
