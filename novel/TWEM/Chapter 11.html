<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Conclusion</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of me, Haruto, Heelis was enveloped in black magic power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What in the world is about to happen now&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t got any information whatsoever, but I could tell it was nothing good.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shaped my hand into a pistol and fired a magic bullet that compresses magic power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic bullet was powerful enough to blow off the upper part of trees and monsters but it was easily blocked by the black mana*. (TLN: interchangeably with black magic)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Was it repelled because the mana is so dense?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While muttering, I checked the surrounding situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the others seemed to have finished killing both of the Yvels, but they got anxious after seeing the situation with Heelis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same was true for Finne, Iris, Kusel and Asha who were near the royal family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the black mana kept getting thicker and thicker.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to take countermeasures, just in case.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tendo, Finne. Gather everyone in one place. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on with this guy, so I&#8217;m going to set up a barrier to protect everyone together&#8230;&#8230;gather the royals together, too, just in case.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I didn&#8217;t really care what happened to the royal family, but if they died in the aftermath of the battle, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to make sure they got their comeuppance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and Finne nodded, and everyone gathered around the royals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Aegis*&#8221; (TLN: Space Rupture Barrier)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, the strongest barrier that blocked all kinds of interference was deployed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at the same time, the magic power that was erupting from Heelis&#8217; body contracted to form a black orb.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the orb popped with great force, and a gigantic Yvel appeared from within.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not only did the body become bigger, but the amount of magic power was more than double what it was before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I WILL, SLAUGHTER YOU&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel’s eyes glowed reddish-black as he glared hard at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure. Go ahead, that’s if you can.&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTQ5NTM1MTU3MzEiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I held up my beloved sword and said to Heelis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis didn&#8217;t say anything, but in reply, multiple magic circles appeared in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How can that many be deployed simultaneously with no chant?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To think someone besides me could perform such a feat.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;DIE!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magic that was released was Fire Lance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you trying to burn down the castle? —Water Wall! ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I&#8217;m sure it didn’t even cross his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of flaming arrows pierced into the wall of water that I had created in front of me, and steam was generated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, I jumped back as quickly as I could because my Detect Danger was triggered, and multiple black hands came at me through the wall of water.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I canceled the water wall and checked, I saw that Heelis&#8217; arm was extended toward me and split in the middle to form countless arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell is that, gross! ”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the corner of my eye, Mogami shouted, and Suzuno and the other girls nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tsk&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, on the other hand, kept cutting off the arms that were chasing me even after I avoided them, but I clicked my tongue at the sheer number of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s easier to deal with these things all at once.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Fire Fang!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cast the spell, and something like a beast’s mouth appeared in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its mouth, with its sharp fangs, bit off the countless hands that were closing in on me, turning them to ashes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Heelis&#8217; arms regenerated endlessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s no end to them. In that case—&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ducked through the countless arms and slipped into melee range of Heelis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recovery speed seems to be a little faster, but so long as it’s still a Yvel, it should disappear into dust if I cut up its body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having made that decision, I slashed Heelis into small pieces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;How about this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved some distance away, just in case, and watched as Heelis regenerated at a much faster rate than before.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-62518222' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-62518222' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPScyJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI0NjU2ODgwMzY4Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you kidding me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, who had actually fought a Yvel earlier and knew how troublesome their regenerative ability was, let the words slip out as if to say she couldn&#8217;t believe it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is indeed a phenomenal regeneration speed, but it didn&#8217;t change the fact that I had to defeat this freak.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regenerated Heelis stood up and launched yet another set of countless branched arms at me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was trying to think of a way to deal with them while avoiding them, but to my annoyance, fire, wind, and dark magic were released from each hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He also wields three attributes?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to stop evading the magic that was coming at me from every angle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, not that it matters either way—Aegis!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, a barrier was formed around me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis&#8217; magic landed, and with an explosion, the surrounding area was covered in smoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twisted in a convoluted pattern, countless arms attacked, but they were also blocked by the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis irritatedly attacked with his arms, but was unable to break through the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saw an opening and released the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, his arms and magic rushed at me, but I dove within melee range of Heelis again using Ground Shrink.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then launched quickdraw arts consecutively, cutting off both arms from their base.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such perfect timing, it would be faster for me to swing my sword than for Heelis to regenerate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just as I was about to drop his head—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu, GaaaaaaaaaAAHh!!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis roared.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden roar at such close range startled me for just a moment, and then Heelis&#8217; arm regenerated even faster than before and attacked me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I jumped backward as quickly as I could, but the arm split off and attacked me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing there would be no end to them even if I continued to cut them off.

<p><br /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His race has changed from human to Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, his skills have increased compared to before he became a Yvel, and the level of his original skills has also increased.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And most notably—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fire attributes magic immunity, really?&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also a skill that he didn&#8217;t have before he became a Yvel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the first time he got hit by an inferno, he indeed suffered some damage&#8230;so perhaps it was newly acquired after enduring those flames.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would explain why the blow earlier had suddenly become heavier. He must have upgraded his strong arm skill or acquired a new one.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked back to the hall, feeling bitter that I had let my guard down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis was so desperate to break the barrier that was protecting Finne and the others that he didn&#8217;t seem to notice me.

It&#8217;s got a ridiculous amount of magic power in it. If activated, it&#8217;ll be a very large scale magic spell.

I knew it was a material release type magic spell, I&#8217;m glad the barrier could handle it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, it&#8217;s a powerful magic, just as I expected. If it had been an ordinary barrier instead of Aegis, wouldn&#8217;t it have broken through?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The barrier is still swirling with dense magic and flames.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Such a pain in the butt, why not do me a favor and just croak already&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hoped so, but reality, like always, is a bitch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now let’s face it, he’s kind of sturdy, has super regeneration and even fire attribute magic immunity skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when the explosive flames in the barrier cleared up, there was Heelis, unharmed as expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I’m not surprised&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I sighed, Heelis was swinging his arms and casting spells in an attempt to get out of the barrier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he couldn&#8217;t destroy it with his magic earlier, there was no way he could destroy it with such petty attacks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, there was no way for me to attack as is.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to release the barrier and go on the offensive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the barrier lifted, Heelis stretched out his arms and attacked, but I evaded all of them and slipped into his range.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sliced off both of his arms and used ice magic to seal them so that he couldn&#8217;t regenerate any more.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“—Tundra*&#8221; (TLN: Literal translation is “Permafrost”)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those words, cold air drifted from around me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the cold air made contact, Heelis&#8217; entire body froze, and he became icebound.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, there is no room for arms to grow. I would be able to finish him off slowly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I thought that, the ice cracked with a snap and a crack.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh you gotta be kiddin’ me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-96664000' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-96664000' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis then regenerated both of his arms and at the same time crushed the ice that was clinging to his entire body.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis, with his momentum, swung his countless arms at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I avoided the arms and retreated, thinking about my next move.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What now? Normally, Heelis should have perished being icebound just like that~&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew it. That super regeneration is a nuisance. I can use recovery magic too, but being able to automatically recover at such a fast rate is just too convenient.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the fact that All Creation and Copy, which can create all kinds of skills, doesn&#8217;t acquire them on its own, means that they must be special skills. I guess they must be special skills unavailable to humans.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I formed a pistol shape with my left hand while avoiding the countless arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the same magic bullet that I fired when he was in the black orb, but this time I&#8217;ve increased the speed and the number of rounds to make it look like a rifle. This will greatly increase both the power and penetration.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the magic bullet I fired landed on Heelis&#8217; head, it instantly exploded and disappeared into dust.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The super regeneration regenerated his head, as planned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Heelis couldn&#8217;t see my movements with his head missing, creating a huge opening.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I invoked a magic spell with a stronger visualization than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s bring this to a close—Holy Chain!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I muttered the name of the spell, Heelis&#8217; arms and body were bound by chains of light that appeared from the void.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I&#8217;ve seen of Tendo and the others&#8217; battles, Yvels are probably weak against holy magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe holy magic is supposed to &#8220;extinguish evil creatures&#8221;. So it must have some kind of power over a Yvel, which is a monster.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I can&#8217;t use holy magic. Then I&#8217;ll have to think of something else&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right. For now, how about infusing all my magic power into it?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My beloved sword, black katana Benizakura, is a divine weapon with the ability of absolute cleave and indestructibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, just putting magic power into it should be enough to give it considerable power.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put my hand on the hilt of my sword, which was still in its sheath, and began pouring magic power into it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, black katana Benizakura began to glow with a dazzling crimson light that could be seen even through the scabbard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!? GAAAAAAAAAAAHHh!!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis, perhaps sensing the danger, roared and tried to escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was no way to break out of the bindings of the Holy Chain, which had become even stronger than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You thought that you could best me with the power you obtained from a mere potion.

We met the heroes that the boss mentioned’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;All right. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re all okay. And the heroes, are they all right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Yes sir. There are a few injured among them as well, but some of them can use recovery magic, so they&#8217;re fine.’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “All right. I&#8217;ll contact you later.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Copy sir.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, the second and third groups contacted me, and both were in similar situations, but no fatalities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that all the elves are safe&#8230;and I heard that they encountered some heroes in the castle town.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told them what I had heard from Aegan, they all looked relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s such a relief&#8230;still, some heroes? I wonder which&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno looked at me strangely, but I shook my head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Beats me. I&#8217;ll inform you the details later&#8230;now, all that&#8217;s left is—&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, and looked at the royals who had fainted before I knew it, probably from the intensity of the battle.</span></p>
