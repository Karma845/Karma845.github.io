<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; The Elven Village</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, we arrived safely at the Tonitia Forest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So this is the Tonitia Forest&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tonitia Forest was also known as &#8220;Sea of Trees&#8221; due to the trees being so thick that we could barely see into the back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were many tall trees, and some of them were so big that their trunks were several meters thick.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was speechless at the sight, including me, except for Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess this is what it means to be overwhelmed by nature.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like we wouldn&#8217;t be able to proceed into the forest with the carriage, so I decided to have Maguro enter the subspace along with the carriage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ephyr she would know roughly the location of the village when she got close, so we proceeded with her in the lead.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;The monstrous presence is growing thicker. Please be very careful.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, everyone proceeded to look around nervously.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it&#8217;s good that they&#8217;re vigilant, but?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t just look around you, watch your steps too—”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I could finish my sentence, Tendo stumbled over a tree root and nearly fell.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Tendo like this eased our tension and we proceeded with a good sense of urgency, but only Ephyr seemed to be very wary of her surroundings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the horror of the attack on her village had come back to her?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so cautious, Ephyr. If anything happens, we&#8217;ll protect you.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Okay. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr looked relieved at my words. I hoped I&#8217;d been able to ease her burden a little&#8230;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I thought that, my detect danger skill reacted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“——! ？”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must have noticed it from my reaction or by themselves. Everyone raised their alert level and readied their weapons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re under attack!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shouted sharply while activating the barrier magic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, something hit the barrier that surrounded us and fell to the ground.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-18861438' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-18861438' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking down, I saw an ordinary arrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stared in the direction the arrow came from.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gotcha!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard to tell through the branches, but there was a man with a bow and arrow on a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I used a combination of physical boost and ground shrink to instantly close in on the man.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha-?! When did he!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The man, who looked to be in his early twenties, made a flustered sound.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He threw the bow he was holding at me and quickly pulled out a knife, but I avoided the bow and circled behind the man, and then I put him down and restrained him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who the hell are you guys, attacking us out of nowhere?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I asked him that——</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Get your hands off our comrade!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the voice, arrows came flying from both sides.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly avoided the arrows, but the man I had been restraining slipped out and moved directly to his friends using wind magic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa whoa, you attacked us first, didn’t you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmph, what do you expect after setting foot on our land!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? ‘Our Land’?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking closely, the men&#8217;s ears are pointed. Don’t tell me&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By chance could you guys be—— elves?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! We are the elves of the Tonitia Forest.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so they weren&#8217;t wiped out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If these are the elves of the Tonitia Forest, I needed to confirm something.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to open my mouth with that thought——&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also, I don&#8217;t know why she’s with you, but I will have you return our ‘Princess’ back to us!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elven man said and readied his weapon again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so they saw Ephyr and attacked us.&nbsp;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTkyNDQ2NTI3NjciIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmmm, it didn’t look like they&#8217;re going to calm down and listen to me. I could just clean them up nicely and be done with it, but if it’s all the same I thought I’d just let Tendo and the others give it their best.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I jumped off the tree branch and walked back to where everyone was.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone must have been able to see what was happening, and without panicking, Tendo and Mogami stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three elves followed suit and stopped right in front and quickly shot arrows at us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was grabbing the arrows and stopping them, two of the three elves on both sides switched their bows to daggers and rushed in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, a high-pitched shrill echoes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tendou lunged forward, he caught the elf&#8217;s dagger with his holy sword. Tendo went on to hit the elf in the gut with the hilt of his holy sword, knocking him out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successively, a muffled thud was heard.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Mogami ducked the dagger, grabbed the opponent, and threw him on his back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you&#8217;ve both learned to hold back a little.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m still not comfortable with hurting people with weapons after all.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. It was a spur of the moment thing for me too, but I&#8217;m glad I was able to handle it.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we were talking about this, the male elf that was left standing released his magic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Acting like some kind of bigshots! ——Air Arrow!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hm, in that case, me too.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I unleashed an air arrow with no chant and easily canceled it out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, I fired off another air arrow, which flew straight to the elf.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?! Shit!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elf was surprised, and quickly jumped to the side to avoid the magic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I circled behind him and put a knife around his neck.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure they were unconscious, I tied all three of them up together.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Now what, Ephyr?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Ephyr, who was being protected by everyone, what to do with the three of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked at the three of them with concern. They probably knew each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-Well, I&#8217;m but a slave now&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess she’s trying to say that she’s not in a position to ask for something, and being reserved.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. Then this is an order Ephyr. I leave it to you, Ephyr, to decide what to do with these three.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay, I understand. I would like to hear from these three people.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr looked me straight in the eye and said so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and woke up the three elves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, wake up. How long are you going to remain passed out?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I woke them up with a flick to their cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the three of them woke up, they slowly looked around, saw me, and started screaming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;H, hey, sunnavabitch! Hurry up and untie this rope!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come on! And get away from the princess!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Lady Ephyr! Why are you with the humans!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were being noisy and annoying, so I intimidated them for a moment, and the three of them let out a frightened &#8220;hiiii&#8221; and quieted down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Finally, Ephyr spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;This man saved my life, and everyone else knows what happened, and so they brought me here. So please do not speak like that.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even after hearing Ephyr’s words, the elves could not believe it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even so! Humans cannot be trusted!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right! They brought their army and marched into the sacred forest!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My family, my friends, they died right in front of me, you know?! Humans are——”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please believe me! They are not bad people!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of them stared at us after being stunned, as if it was very unusual for Ephyr to raise her voice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not like I don&#8217;t understand their resentment towards humans, but I couldn’t proceed unless they trust me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Ephyr explained what had happened so far since she left the elven village, and the three of them finally stopped staring at us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I guess they couldn’t decide whether to trust me completely and asked cautiously.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Hey. Can we really trust you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They asked me with serious expressions, and I answered seriously.&nbsp;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-61727396' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-61727396' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trust me. I’m not going to lie to you. I&#8217;m on your side.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that the three of them were convinced, I untied the ropes and released them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, on our way to the elven village, we asked the reason why they attacked us earlier and the current situation of the elven village.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three seemed to have been patrolling around the village, and when one of them spotted me with Ephyr he attacked me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The two guys who attacked me later said they saw the first guy caught by me and they attacked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that the three of them are among the strongest in the elven village&#8230;well, I guess they were pretty much out of luck with me as their opponent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as for the current situation of the elven village, the invading army ravaged it as much as they could and then retreated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there were a good number of people who fell but did not die or were able to go into hiding, the damage to the village was great, and there were a lot of victims and the displaced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they managed to restore the village to a livable condition, they could not grasp the whereabouts of Ephyr. That&#8217;s when we showed up&#8230;or so the gist went.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Finally.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we proceeded through the fog that concealed the elven village, the elf in the lead—— the handsome guy who attacked us first, apparently named Tashal—— spoke up as we finished hearing about the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything out of the ordinary&#8230;then the next moment, a strong light surrounded us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light soon faded, and when I removed my hand from covering my face, I saw a beautiful scene spread before my eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;So beautiful.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An open land, with a narrow river running through, and fields.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the houses were built on the ground, but there were some that were built on huge trees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are traces of burned-down houses and fallen trees here and there, but&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the elven village looked beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were making our way through the village to meet the village chief.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the gazes from the residents of the village were harsh.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are the same humans as the army that attacked them before, it couldn’t be helped.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But their gazes turned to one of joy when they saw Ephyr with us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air in the village seemed to light up as they cheered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wondered why she was with us, but they were more than happy to have Ephyr back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you were this loved, Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——This is the house.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrived in front of the largest house in the village.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarshal knocks on the door of the village chief’s house.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Village chief, are you there? It&#8217;s Tarshal. There&#8217;s someone I&#8217;d like you to meet.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? Hold on.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then a young man&#8217;s voice came from the inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a long wait, a handsome young man opened the door and came out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought it might be the voice from earlier, but I was surprised because I had an image of the chief as an old man.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting, Tashal. So, this someone you’d like me, to, meet&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village chief saw us&#8230;no, his eyes widened when he saw Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And immediately, he went down on one knee on the spot and bowed his head.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you safe and sound lady Ephyhr. I am awfully sorry about what happened to lady Elsha and lord Elba.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Aegan, raise your head. Thank you for bringing everyone together&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Ephyr’s words, the village chief—Aegan looked up and stared at Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not at all. I was just doing what was natural. Lady Ephyr, I beseech you, please come back as our chief!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I’m afraid I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr said, shaking her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, continued to speak slowly to Aegan, who seemed to be on the verge of asking, “Why?”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was about to die when this man&#8230;master Haruto, saved me. When master Haruto found out what had happened to our village, he brought me here. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to continue to follow master Haruto.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan looks at us after Ephyr&#8217;s words.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you people are Lady Ephyr’s savior?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I replied, after having quietly watched the conversation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Ephyr was sold into slavery in a state where she was about to die, but I bought her and healed her.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-44285349' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-44285349' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan, apparently surprised by the word slave, opened his eyes wide and looked at Ephyr, who nodded back, and then closed his eyes as if in thought. A few seconds later, he opened his eyes again and looked at us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;So that’s how it is, I see. Please come inside if it’s all right.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no reason to reject the suggestion, so we decided to discuss it with our group, Tarshal and company, and Aegan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, Ephyr explained in detail how she had escaped and was bought by me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the seemingly long but short explanation, a few minutes of silence drifted over the room. In this silence, Aegan was the first to speak.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; You said your name was Haruto right?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please pardon me for the belated greetings. I&#8217;m not the official village head, but I&#8217;m Aegan, a relative of lady Ephyr, who is acting in the absence of the village head and his family. I would like to express my gratitude to you for rescuing our princess.” </span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-21543 size-full" src="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan.jpg" alt="" width="1009" height="1481" srcset="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan.jpg 1009w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan-204x300.jpg 204w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan-660x969.jpg 660w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aegan-66x96.jpg 66w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan bowed, and Tarshal and the others followed suit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please raise your heads. It’s not a big deal. Besides, I have some kind of connection with the lot&#8230;Kingdom of Glicente that attacked this village.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha—, that army belonged to the Kingdom of Glicente! &#8230;So, what&#8217;s this connection you mentioned?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They kicked me out of the country after labeling me incompetent. And then I almost got killed&#8230; I managed to survive and now live in the Kingdom of Perdis.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that’s how it is. That must have been rough.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I skipped the details quite a bit, but it’s mostly accurate anyway.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More importantly——</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aegan, do you want revenge on Glicente?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves in the room twitched at my words, and Aegan answered as if representing them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Of course we do. How could we not want to avenge our dead brethren?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves nodded vigorously, but Aegan continued helplessly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But we lack the strength to do so. Didn&#8217;t you get kicked out because you were powerless too?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, at the time I got kicked out anyway. But not anymore. I can at least give you guys a hand.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan looked to him for confirmation, and Tarshal nodded.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We crossed blades, and I can tell you that this human is quite strong. I was completely helpless against him, and he had me pinned down.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, if Tarshal and the others can be considered to be among the strongest, then I think I alone am more than enough to suppress this village&#8230;but, I’d better not say that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So what are you gonna do? Do you want revenge? Or not?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Please allow us time to think about it. It&#8217;s not something I can decide on my own, so could you wait here for a while?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Aegan got up and walked out of the house, taking Tarshal and the others with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waiting for about half an hour, Tarshal came to call me, and says, &#8220;Please come with me.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were led to the village square.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many elves had gathered there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Tarshal, Aegan had gathered everyone in the village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they saw Ephyr among us, they cheered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the cheers subsided, Aegan opened his mouth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you all for gathering here. As you may already know, Lady Ephyr has returned to the village! The humans with her are the ones who rescued her!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves in the square looked at us with mixed emotions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this was a mess created with no thanks to the humans in the first place, so it’s only natural that they have reservations showing their gratitude.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, now that Lady Ephyr is back, I would like to ask. Everyone——would you like to take revenge on the humans who attacked our village, on the Kingdom of Glicente?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word ‘revenge’ from Aegan caused a stir.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean by revenge, village chief&#8230;?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Exactly what it means. There&#8217;s a good chance that the Kingdom of Glicente will strike again. Before that happens, we must attack and avenge our people, our friends and our families!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agan says so powerfully, but there is a voice of anxiety.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I certainly do want revenge! But&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, we couldn&#8217;t even hold our own against that army.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And yet, we want to take on a country&#8230;won’t we just end up losing our brethren again&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not surprising, the elves were vulnerable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I stand next to Aegan and raise my voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s true that you elves won&#8217;t be able to defeat Glicente on your own! But what if you had someone with overwhelming strength in your company? Maybe someone capable of defeating an army of ten thousand by himself?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A human who suddenly steps forward and spouts such a thing would surely be looked upon with reproach.&nbsp;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-12109204' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-12109204' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As you can see, I&#8217;m a human. I am sure you all have your reservations——but I also have a bone to pick with Glicente. And I certainly can&#8217;t forgive those who made my friend, Ephyr so sad&#8230;so if you really do want revenge, I, the most powerful man in the world, will help you!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that much, the square fell silent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The silence persisted for a while, but then Aegan glared at me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;———Hmph. The world&#8217;s strongest, huh? Then you must have the power to back up that claim, right?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? Seems like Aegan changed his tone?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I did rob him of his speech stand after all, then went on to say something outrageous like being the strongest in the world, it&#8217;s not surprising that he got pissed. I said &#8216;I have the power&#8217; but I didn&#8217;t mention anything like it being my own strength as an individual, and it&#8217;s possible that he thought I could borrow Perdis&#8217; troops.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe he was pissed off about what I said regarding &#8216;Ephyr being my friend&#8217; or the fact that I bought her as a slave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m doing something to piss him off.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s no need for me to pull any punches at this point. I don&#8217;t think I can convince them otherwise&#8230;rather, I have a feeling that Aegan was up to something with this change~.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why? You want to find out? Don’t tell me you want to have a duel with me or something?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Oh, that&#8217;s a good idea. I&#8217;m going to make you regret your big mouth.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan snickered as if he was mocking us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, what’s the rules of this duel?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan asks if we can set some rules, but that&#8217;s a given.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s going to be just me over here. You can have as many as you want on your side.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wha—! ? ――Hmph, fine. Just don&#8217;t regret it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan said this as a throwaway line, and then suddenly Iris pulled me back to where everyone was.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you thinking! You can&#8217;t just take on any number of people against a race of elves who are skilled in magic! No matter how strong you are, Haruto&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Haruto! Sure with your ability, you’ll be able to take on a few, but anymore and it’s going to be tough even for you!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You guys&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha and Ephyr nodded at Iris and Kusel’s words.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure everyone but Kusel knows what I&#8217;m capable of&#8230;they’ve only seen my status, and I am sure they think it’ll be pretty dicey if dozens of elves skilled in magic gangs up on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was only one person who looked at me differently.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Finne.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What do you think, Finne?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto will win for sure. I believe that there is no one stronger than him. I&#8217;ve seen him destroy a horde of ten thousand demons with my own eyes, and he is also my beloved. I think it&#8217;s our role to believe in him and await his victory.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone fell silent at Finne&#8217;s words.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne&#8217;s face was slightly red. Is it because she said something she usually doesn&#8217;t say?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Haruto. Is there anything we can do?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo said this to me when he was sure no one else would object.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, let’s see&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s out there, so keep everyone safe will you. You are a hero. You are not a tool for killing people. Protecting them is what you, heroes, are supposed to do.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Tendo nodded to my words without saying anything.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while we were talking, Aegan came to call me, probably having finished selecting the members.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’ve decided. There are five of us. Are you sure about this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not much, I thought they&#8217;d come in larger numbers&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No problem. Is there any open space around?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah. On the outskirts of the village, there is a clearing larger than this square. Let&#8217;s go there&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I was then led to a rather open area.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the village elves in the square were following us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I made my way to the center of the clearing, five individuals came out of the group of elves&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? Aegan, are you fighting too?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, Aegan was among them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Aegan opens his mouth, his chest heaving.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I may not look it, but I am one of the strongest in the village. Don’t tell me you’re getting cold feet now. You&#8217;re the most powerful man in the world, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“You bet I am. No chance in hell I’m going to lose.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elves looked at me angrily as I said this, but I brushed them off aloofly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;And then, in return, I invoked intimidation—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now then, shall we begin?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;I said this.</span></p>
