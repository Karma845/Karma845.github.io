<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Past and Future</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That evening, some of the knights led by Glifas and a group of court magicians, including Marvelle, the chief royal magician, returned to the royal castle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Glifas and Marvelle, the anti-royalists, had gathered only members of their own faction and had been holding joint exercises in the western city for several days. Which explains why there were so few knights and court magicians in the castle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Glifas and the others saw the devastation in the castle, they quickly raised their weapons, but when Kusel and the Prime Minister explained the situation, they were immediately convinced and promised to help rebuild the country.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that night.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took Finne and the rest to the room where my classmates were gathered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room was filled with Tendo and the others, Ms. Usami and the rest of my classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I entered the room, I was bombarded with lots of questions at a tremendous pace.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I only gave a half-hearted explanation earlier, I guess.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Everyone, please calm down. I&#8217;m going to explain exactly what happened in detail.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I prefaced my story by telling everyone about how Mariana had kicked me out, how I had almost been killed in the woods, how god had given me skills, and how I had become an adventurer and risen to EX rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was shocked to find out that Mariana had tricked them, but then Ms. Usami had an epiphany.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yuki, if the person who gave you that skill is really a god, wouldn&#8217;t he know how to return to our original world!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher&#8217;s words made my classmates buzz and they looked at me expectantly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them may have adjusted to this world completely, but somewhere in their hearts, they still want to go back to their own world—to Japan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen God since then, so it&#8217;s hard to say&#8230;besides, according to him, some have had success returning, but he’s not informed of their methods. Something about hero summoning being forbidden, so even a god can&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-58492782' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-58492782' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, I see&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Usami and my classmates were visibly depressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right, what about the king who summoned us, maybe he knows something!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh, but the king is&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was staring at me, so I nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I kinda killed him”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““‘Kinda’, my ass!?”””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all snapped at me with retorts from all angles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Calm down guys, if we check the room where we were summoned from, or ask the court magicians, or even the archives, they should be able to provide some kind of information.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That may be true, but&#8230;can we really go back?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I denied Orihara&#8217;s skeptical words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Switch that ‘Can we really go back?’ mindset to, ‘We definitely going back!’, okay. Even god didn&#8217;t deny the possibility of us returning, and there are precedents, too. Right now I don&#8217;t know how, but I&#8217;ll find out for sure.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all nodded when I said that with confidence.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;You’re right. But it&#8217;s not &#8216;I&#8217;, it&#8217;s &#8216;we&#8217;, isn’t that right?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right, we&#8217;re all gonna find it!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes! We all want to go home!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were several voices initially, and eventually, it became a cheer.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTU5Mzk5NDg4NjUiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost everyone&#8217;s faces were full of motivation and hope, a complete change from the gloomy expressions they had been wearing earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of this excitement, Asakura clapped her hands as if remembering.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Yuki! Why don&#8217;t you introduce Finne and the others to everyone?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, right. That&#8217;s why I brought them here.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was explaining what happened to me earlier, I mentioned their names, but I didn&#8217;t introduce them properly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps it was because I was in the conference room yesterday, but my classmates seemed to be paying attention to them with great interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. Allow me to introduce them. These are my companions”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, indicating Finne with my palm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne opened her mouth, nervous from all the attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My name is Finne. I met Haruto in Vaana, a town on the border between the Kingdom of Glicente and the Kingdom of Perdis. He helped me when I was tangled up with adventurers, and we&#8217;ve been working together ever since. Now—I’m Haruto’s fiancée!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone except for Tendo and the others froze for a moment at Finne’s statement. And then—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“““EEeeeeeeeeeeehhHHHHh!?’’’”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all shouted in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s so surprising about that? &#8230;Okay, it’s a little surprising.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before the surprise could fade, Iris dropped another bomb.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to meet you. I am Iris Arclaidh Perdis, the first princess of the Kingdom of Perdis. And like Finne, I am also Haruto’s fiancée!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?”””</span></p><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-21969 size-full" src="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem.jpg" alt="" width="1009" height="1481" srcset="https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem.jpg 1009w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem-204x300.jpg 204w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem-768x1127.jpg 768w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem-660x969.jpg 660w, https://shintranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Harem-66x96.jpg 66w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classmates again speak in unison. You guys are so in sync, aren’t ya.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Orihara asked timidly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, by first princess, you mean Iris, I mean Lady Iris’ father is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s the king of the Kingdom of Perdis. You&#8217;re Haruto’s classmate, right? Then, you don&#8217;t need to use honorifics or &#8216;Lady&#8217; when addressing me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand, I mean, sure. So, is your betrothal officially recognized by His Majesty the King?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Iris answered with her chest out, I was given a number of dirty looks.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He&#8217;s even got his fangs all over this junior high school kid&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a crime?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey Yuki, be honest and out with it. Do so, and we&#8217;ll let you off half dead.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, no, you guys are looking eager to kill!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the boys were pulling out their weapons!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-Wait, wait, wait! I haven’t done anything to her! Tell ‘em, Iris!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, looking for help, but&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, not yet.

Next, let me introduce Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when I thought that—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes. I&#8217;m also Haruto&#8217;s fiancée♪.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno came out and said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, what, that’s news to me though!?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-Ichinomiya, are you being serious?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Suzuno, you finally confessed your feelings to him!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes! I told him when we finally met again!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno&#8217;s answer was met with high-pitched cheers from the girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So we decided to stay together&#8230;I talked to Finne and Iris about it, and they said they didn’t mind if it was me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh no, that&#8217;s for me to decide, not Finne and the others, isn’t it&#8230;?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I was lost in thought, but one of the girls who heard Suzuno&#8217;s story came up to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yuki, can I have a word with you?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How do you feel about Suzuno, Yuki?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, um&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t think of anything to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t dislike Suzuno. I&#8217;ve been with her ever since we met again, and I&#8217;ve enjoyed our time together&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure how to react to this, as I never thought I’d suddenly be declared her fiancé.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto.

I will always keep Suzuno safe.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At these words, the girls surrounding Suzuno shouted for the third time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard one of them say &#8220;Awwww, I would like to be told that, too&#8221;.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, Suzuno&#8217;s face was the reddest I&#8217;ve ever seen and she turned her head down.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Wait, if you&#8217;re that embarrassed, you’re going to make me start blushing, too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if to disguise my embarrassment, I moved on to introduce Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, now it&#8217;s Ephyr’s turn.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pulled Ephyr’s hand and brought her in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, uh, my name is Ephyr. I am an elf. As you may already know from this morning, I was sold into slavery after my village was attacked, but Master Haruto saved me&#8230;and I also wish to marry Master Haruto!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aaaaahhh!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help but raise my voice, but my classmates were no longer surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the only one who was surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you think, M-Ms. Finne?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Finne with trepidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;s going to be angry that I&#8217;m adding too many people, not just Suzuno but now Ephyr.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Me? Oh, I knew that Ephyr had feelings for Haruto, and Iris and I had talked about the possibility of it turning out this way though?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Iris.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, it’s true! Of course I&#8217;m not against Ephyr either. So now, that makes four of us, wow, way to go Haruto!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at a loss for words.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-65816948' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-65816948' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no idea this was going to happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Yuki&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yuki &#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the boys were giving out a stronger killing intent than before.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them were still holding their weapons, but none of them looked like they were going to jump me. They probably understood that they were no match for me from the intimidation I had unleashed on them at the meeting this morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving my classmates to their own devices, Ephyr came up to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is it, no good sir?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she looked up at me with moist eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I didn&#8217;t say that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, let’s get along better”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes sir♪&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, there&#8217;s no reason to refuse now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ignored the jealousy-filled murmurs from the boys and the &#8220;real-life harem&#8230;&#8221; mutterings from the girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ms. Usami was looking bewildered as if she couldn&#8217;t keep up with the developments, but after a while she finally seemed to grasp the situation and her face turned red.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I was suddenly curious, so I asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Speaking of which, why were you all in the royal capital? I heard that you guys left at the same time as Tendo and the others.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s still too early from the three months directed by the king, so what&#8217;s up?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tendo, who seemed to have the same question as me, asked, Orihara answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s because—&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, a month after the heroes left the royal capital, the king informed them that the deadline for their journey would be changed to two months.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So yesterday, exactly the two months deadline, all of my classmates except for me and Tendo and the others, including Ms. Usami, all gathered in the royal capital&#8230;was pretty much the gist of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? I didn’t receive any such notification though?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew it. The messenger asked me if I had any idea as to your whereabouts, but&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Tendo and Orihara pondering, Suzuno raised her voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, I suppose we were already in the elven village a month after we left the capital, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Asakura counted on his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Oh, you’re actually right! Well, that explains why you couldn’t find us, I mean, who would think to look for us in the elven village right.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mogami and Shinonome nodded their heads in agreement. Seeing this, Orihara continued to talk.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that&#8217;s what happened&#8230; and we were resting at the inn and that’s when all hell breaks loose, right? We went out to help the people, and when we were struggling, the elves saved us&#8230;I guess that’s about it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. You guys are really brave heroes to have moved so quickly to help the citizens.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this with admiration, Orihara and the others smiled embarrassedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, we talked about what had happened in this other world until we dispersed.</span></p>
