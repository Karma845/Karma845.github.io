<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Yvel</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuhahahaa, don&#8217;t get carried away, you punks!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What now?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did he finally go crazy from all these or something?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first prince—Heelis, continued to speak even as we turned our attention to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sorry to say this, but you’re all doomed—&#8217;Full Release&#8217;!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his cry, I heard what sounded like a heartbeat with my enhanced hearing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the next moment</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aa, aaaah, aaaaahhhhhh!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis&#8217;s magic power went out of control&#8230;or rather, seemed more like a deliberate outburst?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the magic power of the other young royals nearby also went out of control.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bodies of Heelis and the others gradually changed in size and became more ominous.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Heelis and the others transformed into deformed-looking beings.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The muscles covered with dark skin swelled up and became even bigger than an ogre’s. The most noteworthy thing was the enormous amount of magic power overflowing from their entire bodies.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;IT’S STILL IN THE prototype stage, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE a success. I’M OVERFLOWING with POWER”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis&#8217; words were in such a broken language.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;What the hell is that?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-44933619' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-44933619' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a triumphant look on his face, the monster that had been Heelis replied.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A compulsive enhancement potion—’Yvel’. It is a potion that increases BOTH muscle strength AND magic power to an inhuman LEVEL to become ‘Yvel’. The ONLY drawback is that you may LOSE your reason when you transform, AND YOU MAY NOT be able to return your body BACK TO its original form. ANYONE WHO takes THIS potion will transform AT MY signal. Regardless of WHETHER OR NOT they hear my voice OR IN FACT unconscious. I&#8217;m sure that MY men who particiPATED in the attack on the ELVEN Village are RAMPAGING through the capital right now. KuhahahaA&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so he is the ringleader of the soldiers who attacked the elven village.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the effects of the potion seem to be real, and it appears to have made him much stronger.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well you certainly look nothing like a human right now! Would you like a quick look in the mirror?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis was unfazed by my provocation. The surrounding former human royalty also stared at me and did not move. They all seem to be able to keep their wits about them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked at the king, he was smiling fearlessly, as if he knew about this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does this mean that the king approved the research?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Tendo with his hood still on, looked at the demonized people and asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, what do we do?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The ones already out of control will probably continue to run amok until they die. The king&#8217;s children over there are able to keep their wits about them for now, but if they&#8217;re cornered, they&#8217;ll also lose themselves and do the same&#8230;in which case, there&#8217;s only one thing to do&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Are you going to kill them?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t believe he’s still hung up on that at this point in time&#8230;but, maybe that’s one of the good things about Tendo.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we don&#8217;t, the damage will be too great. They&#8217;ll kill us, and they might even kill the king and the others over there&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;&#8230;All right&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the other heroes, including Suzuno, nodded quietly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis, on the other hand, was listening to our conversation with an eerie smile on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kukuku, so WHAT DO YOU plan to do? ARE YOU GOING to fight? OR escape? WELL, I’M NOT GOING TO chase you IF YOU decide to MAKE a BREAK for it. But, I AM GOING TO let loose, THOUGH”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTU1MjEzMTUxMzIiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis&#8217; face twisted into a vicious expression as he said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Checking the entire royal capital on the map, it seems that these out of control freaks were already running rampant all over the city.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, running away was not an option.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we didn&#8217;t kill them quickly, they would only cause more fatalities among the people.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is there no other way than to kill them&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tendo, how long are you going to keep that up? And you still call yourself a hero! Isn&#8217;t a hero supposed to help people who are in trouble, people who are in need of help, rather than being at the mercy of a country?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said briefly, being careful not to be heard by Mariana and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my words, Tendo and the others huffed and looked at each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t hesitate to do so!&nbsp; &#8230;Of course, you guys are hesitant because you haven&#8217;t killed anyone yet. If you don&#8217;t want to do this, leave the killing to us and protect the civilians&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tendo denied my words with a strong voice, which was a complete change from earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a determined look on his face, he held his weapon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m ready now. It’s a bridge I’ll have to cross eventually. It just happens to be today that’s all&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;&#8230;I see&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them, who had transformed into the so-called Yvel, attacked us as if he had lost patience with our leisurely conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its movement was faster than I had imagined it would be.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The king, Mariana and the others were roughly evacuated by the elves to the wall. As if to say, they would not let them die until they were punished.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tendo, Suzuno, Mogami, Asakura, and Shinonome. It&#8217;s up to each of you to decide what to do from here. Now go be a hero—and save lives&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cut off the head of one of the attackers—or rather one of them, with my sword drawn at lightning speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The head fell off easily, and the rest of the body fell down with blood splashing out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the next moment, the rolling head turned to dust and the fallen body stood up. Before I knew it, the head had regenerated as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What’s going on?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered, to which Heelis replied with a laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“THE enormous amount of magic power HAS enabled us WITH A powerful regenerative ability”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. So the overflowing magic power automatically regenerates missing parts huh? But &#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swung my sword at the Yvel that attacked me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;IT’s no USE&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis scoffed at me, but as soon as I put the sword back to its sheath—</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel shredded and crumbled, then disappeared into dust without regenerating.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, it looks like it won&#8217;t regenerate if it&#8217;s cut into pieces like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heelis shouted in surprise as one of the monsters was defeated in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WHAT THE&#8230;DAMMIT, so our POWER IS USELESS on you huh. In THAT CASE, we’LL JUST kill as many of YOUR FRIENDS AS THEY COME! KUKUKU, moreover, WITH YOU SITTING DUCK HERE, IT’S impossible to STOP all of the YVELs running ALL OVER THE CAPITAL!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed at Heelis’ prickly remark.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sigh&#8230;I guess you’re trash through and through uh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around in disgust and made a declaration to the elves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Boys, this time it’s total annihilation. Don&#8217;t let even a single one of those Yvel shits scattered all over the capital escape. The outcome will likely be 50/50 if you take ‘em one-on-one, so make sure you take on each of them in groups. And remember, never let your guard down!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-80869648' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-80869648' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the elves nodded, I continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Leave Ephyr’s protection to me.

But I trained those elves myself. And there&#8217;s no way they will lose to some third-rate monsters&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and the first group had left the royal castle and were running over the rooftops of the city.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The second group headed inside the buildings of the castle, and the third group was going to head to the city center after neutralizing the Yvel freaks within the walls of the castle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city was already rampaging with soldiers who had been turned into Yvels, and screams can be heard from all over the place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guards were also putting up a fight, but some of the guards and knights had been transformed into Yvels in the first place, so the royal capital is in chaos due to the sudden appearance of these monsters.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Disperse in pairs. Eliminate those who have turned into Yvel!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan ordered the elves as he looked around.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on his way, he spotted a Yvel about to swing its huge arm at a little girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was too terrified to move, and her mother rushed to save her, but it was obvious she wouldn’t quite make it in time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel then swung its huge arm down on the girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isley!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cloud of dust rises as the mother&#8217;s heartbroken cry echoes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling pretty stoked, the Yvel pulled out its fist, which had sunk into the ground—but there was no sign of the girl, not even a drop of blood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Yvel thought it had obliterated the girl completely without a trace, and even her despairing mother looked puzzled, a man&#8217;s voice rang out.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How dare you attack even a child with no regard&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A figure in black appeared next to the mother with the girl in his arms—Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This time, make sure you don’t let go of her hands”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y, yes, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you so much!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;The mother bowed to Aegan again and again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;d better get out of here fast”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay.

Ready your weapon, we’re going to hack at it until it can&#8217;t regenerate anymore!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes sir!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two men held up their weapons and smiled ferociously </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like beasts that had just found its prey.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, the two figures disappeared from their spots, and the Yvel’s right arm fell off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yvel tried to regenerate, but its left arm instantly fell off.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, helplessly, its left leg, right leg, neck, and torso were sliced and diced.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed to regenerate even with only the body trunk left, but when it took one last hit, it disappeared into the dust.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, next”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Copy, sir&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and his team reduced the number of Yvels by one or two more, but a large number had been turned into Yvels, and there were still a considerable number of them left.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of this, Aegan and his partner saw a group of boys and girls fighting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their movements were better than the adventurers who were fighting in various places.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Who are they?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not sure, sir. Maybe they&#8217;re the so-called classmates of the boss or Tendo and the others?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;For some reason, some of the elves had started calling Haruto &#8220;boss&#8221; during this mission.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible, but they seem to be having trouble defeating it, perhaps they don’t know how?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Aegan had said, the group of boys and girls were struggling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very well.

And where did this monster come from&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No point mulling over what we don’t understand!

I and these kids here are heroes who were summoned to this country”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heroes had just returned to the royal capital the other day after being summoned by the king. However, they had yet to prepare for their visit to the royal castle, and were staying at different inns where they got caught up in the commotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and his partner then nodded to each other, as if they were satisfied with what Usami had said.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So these are the people the boss was talking about&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like it&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, Aegan and the others had heard from Haruto that there were other people who had been summoned as heroes just like Tendo and the others, and that they might be in the royal capital.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking that simplifies things if that’s the case, Aegan told Usami what was going on in the royal capital while withholding information about Haruto.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told her that they were elves and that they had come to this country with the help of someone to take revenge for the previous attack on the elven village. And that this monster is a soldier turned into a monster by a potion made by the royal family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Humans turning monsters&#8230;then that thing from earlier was&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one who muttered was Shoya Orihara, one of the students who had been acting together with Usami.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A former &#8216;human&#8217; I guess. A monster who lost his reason”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And how about reverting them back to humans&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan shook his head at such words from Usami.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible. According to the prince, there&#8217;s no way to turn them back, and even if there was, they&#8217;d be nothing more than monsters, attacking people without regard&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even with those words, Usami and the others were not ready to give up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, Aegan coldly said.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—It&#8217;s useless. Give it up”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But—?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orihara tried to fight back, but stopped speaking when Aegan held a knife to his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the sheer intimidation, the fact that he could not see his movements at all made him realize the difference in their abilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So pesky, nothing you do can make them human again. Oh, and they&#8217;ll die off on their own if we let them be just so you know. But if we wait, who knows how much damage they&#8217;ll cause&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Is that true?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s because the prince who made them take the potion said so. That scumbag of a prince should have been defeated by the boss by now, so nothing to worry about&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, who is this boss?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you want to know, come to the royal castle tomorrow with the other heroes”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is also what Aegan and the others had been told by Haruto. If they should ever come across the heroes, they were told to ask them to come to the castle the next day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I understand”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orihara half-heartedly nodded his head. Then he stared straight at Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the only way to protect the people is to kill them, then we’d better steel ourselves. I want you to teach us how to defeat them&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only way to defeat them—the Yvel, is to cut them into small pieces like we did before. I don’t think you guys can handle them on your own, so cooperate with the elves scattered all over the royal capital”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right. Thank you&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan and his partner nodded at Orihara&#8217;s courtesy and took their leaves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—To defeat the many Yvel that still remained.</span></p>
