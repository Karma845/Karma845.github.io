<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Power of the Elves</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then-begin!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tarshal&#8217;s signal, the mock battle begins.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;At that moment, Aegan closed the distance between us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sidestepped to the right to avoid a sharp strike from a dagger——</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed the arrow that one of the elves shot as it was coming right at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Aegan shoots magic at me from behind, making sure my attention is away from him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8211;Air Bomb!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instantly, a ball of wind exploded behind me, sending a shock and cloud of dust over me. There was almost no damage, but I guess he was trying to take away my vision.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As expected, two daggers came at me. Apparently two of them charged me at once&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I avoided every dagger attack, and in the end they retreated without hitting me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;At that moment, Aegan, who had somehow returned to his original position, and the two elves who had not approached me at all finished their chanting and invoked their magic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Grand Wave!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Air Lance!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;——Air Arrow!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ground wave that Aegan unleashed was magic that makes the ground ripple.&nbsp;</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-92689478' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-92689478' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess his plan was to use it to restrict my movement and then follow up with an attack.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other two magic landed on me, sending up a cloud of dust with a violent sound.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did we get him?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the elves went ahead and said that, only he doesn’t know that’s usually a flag.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan used wind magic to clear the dust cloud, and instead of my battered figure—— he saw me, wrapped in a translucent barrier, unscathed.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the&#8230;? What the hell is that?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan shouted in surprise as he realized that all the attacks he had hurled with all his might had apparently been blocked by magic he had never seen before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them fired an arrow that hit the barrier, but it only caused a small ripple around the surface and fell to the ground.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s just barrier magic.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Barrier, magic?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Aegan was flabbergasted.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mr. Haruto, we elves are a long-lived race and well-versed in magic. I&#8217;ve been around a long time myself, and I&#8217;ve never heard of magic that creates a barrier that can be activated by an individual. What is the concept of this magic exactly?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Oh, so they know nothing about it as I thought, huh?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;But then again, I am under no obligation to reveal anything to him so readily, so I put my index finger to my mouth and smirked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;&#8230;I understand. I guess what you’re trying to say is, defeat me if you want to know.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t answer, but lifted the barrier and walked towards the elves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, three of them, including Aegan, came at me at the same time.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTI1Nzc3ODcyOTYiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the remaining two, one was readying his bow and the other was reciting some kind of chant.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to deal with the arrows and magic that came flying from those two, while dealing with the three who were approaching, which was a surprisingly good combination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them drew my attention, and another one, erased his presence, and attacked me. While dealing with that, another also erased his presence, looking for an opening and then attacked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadliest attacker among them was Aegan, who was unleashing attacks with a spirited voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haah!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I deflected Aegan&#8217;s attack with my sword and dodged a thrust from behind by bending down. But then two of the rearguards unleashed their magic, and as they were caught by the barrier right up front, I swung my sword from the side.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, it would be difficult to counterattack this combination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, to be honest, I could have gotten out of this situation easily like stealing candy from a baby, but I decided to enjoy this situation a little more because it&#8217;s not often that I got to see such great coordination.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two who had been engaged in melee combat alongside Aegan smiled mockingly at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“Where’d that confidence from earlier go? Look at you, completely helpless!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’re still somehow able to evade for now, but I’m pretty sure your body&#8217;s about to give out!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? What did you just say?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got irritated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan noticed that my mood had changed and yelled at them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fool! Can’t you see?! He&#8217;s enjoying the situation!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you sure he’s not just trying to fool us to think that?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I did. Well, I was going to beat him to a pulp.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two rearguards nodded at the words of these two naive vanguards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Are you finished?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn&#8217;t Aegan who answered my question, but them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, we’re gonna get serious now.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;Your friends are so going to love watching you get thrashed!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm. So you&#8217;re going to entertain me even better than before?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You bet. We’ve just been going easy on you so far, so don&#8217;t get carried away!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sighed in disgust and listened to the conversation between Finne and the others who were observing the battle from a little distance.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;I—, Iris, doesn’t it look like Haruto is a little irritated?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Finne. Now I can only offer them my deepest sympathy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s, uh&#8230;it’s so obvious. I&#8217;ve never seen Haruto like that before.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;You think so too, Suzuno? &#8230;maybe the elven village will be wiped off the map?&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Natsuki! We don’t stand a chance of stopping Haruto by ourselves! Do we, Shinya?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Koji. But if we attack with all our might… nah I think not, still&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I can hear you guys, especially Tendo and Mogami.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would be the point if I did that, anyway?&#8230;then again, frankly speaking, if I did go on a rampage, no one would be able to stop me at my level. Not like I planned on going on a random rampage in the first place!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I increased the intimidation I was exerting on Aegan and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, damn it&#8230;!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wh, what the hell is this, this intimidation&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All four of them, except Aegan, turned pale and fell to their knees with both hands on the ground. Aegan himself seemed to be barely able to keep on his feet.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-60678954' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-60678954' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Whoops? Looks like the intimidation was directed at Tendo and Mogami as well, and were both turning pale. My bad, my bad, sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I excluded them from the intimidation and called out to Aegan and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? What are you doing sticking your hands in the ground? Did you all drop a gold coin or something? &#8230;You&#8217;re not going to tell me that you can&#8217;t fight with this level of intimidation, are you? Let&#8217;s try to make it a little stronger, shall we?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said it in a mocking tone, and sure enough, the two vanguards from earlier took the bait. What simpletons.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&#8220;Th, th, th, this level of intimidation is no big deal!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Th, that&#8217;s right! N, not even close!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so? Then, I&#8217;ll just tune it up a notch, just a little.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Just as I was about to increase the intimidation, one of them opened his mouth in a panic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, no, no, please no&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fools! Are you still unable to grasp that the intimidation just now speaks of his strength!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;But at that moment, Aegan shouted angrily. At last, the two rearguards couldn&#8217;t withstand my intimidation and fainted.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that why we lost to Glicente, boys?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason it became a scolding session, so I withdrew the intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Aegan looked relieved, but the posture of the two vanguards who are being scolded remained the same as before. Like dumbasses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was pondering on this, Aegan continued to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are among the strongest in the village. That’s why you were selected to be part of this &#8230;isn&#8217;t that right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Humm, yes&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If so, then you should be able to correctly gauge the strength of your opponent. Don&#8217;t get worked up from just a little provocation&#8230;and, Mr. Haruto&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan turned to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand how strong you are, Mr. Haruto. But if you could just go easy with the provocation&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, fine. By the way, do you still want to continue?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan immediately shook his head in refusal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we’re good. We initially just wanted to see how strong you are Mr. Haruto. The villagers didn&#8217;t seem to believe you either, but after showing such a difference in strength against five of the strongest in my village, and winning by an overwhelming margin, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re convinced.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, so while measuring my strength, he wanted to make sure that everyone in the village agreed that I was a force to be reckoned with.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess this explains his sudden change.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that was your intention all along. In that case, we can just call it a day, right?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. The rooms are, umm, right… we have a vacant house, and we were hoping you could stay there&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No problem. We appreciate the provision.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan looked relieved, then glanced at the two vanguards.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll make sure those idiots get a good scolding.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the word &#8220;scold&#8221; from Aegan, the two elves jerked their shoulders.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, well, you know, just go easy on them!&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I excused myself from Aegan, who had a big smile on his face, and walked over to Finne and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we were led to the house by Tarshal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;It seemed that Ephyr had something to discuss, so the rest of us decided to wait for her return.&nbsp;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-62215976' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-62215976' data-code='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' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were chatting and laughing, Tendo asked me as if he just had a recall.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, Haruto, do you have something against me and Shinya?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? What are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked that in return, Mogami turned his gaze on me as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s no use trying to play dumb, Yuki. The reason you used intimidation on Kouji and me in the mock battle earlier was because you had something to say, right? Hey, you have something to say, don’t you?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendou and Mogami said all that, but I have nothing against them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s not like that. It just leaked by mistake. I guess I’ve still got a ways to go myself”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said this with a slightly apologetic expression, but Tendo looked at me with an even more intense gaze.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean even with your remarkable ability you accidentally singled out me and Shinya, huh?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nobody is perfect, you know.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay, that’s it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo&#8217;s tone suddenly changed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wh, what’s gotten into you all of a sudden?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;But Tendo didn&#8217;t answer, he picked up his holy sword that was leaning against the wall and pulled it out.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Tendo? W-Why are you pulling out the holy sword&#8230;?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just get out in the open! Right now!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stepped back as Tendo approached me, one step at a time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey Haruto&#8230; Don&#8217;t you dare run away?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;C-Calm down Tendo. Let’s just talk it out!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like hell I can FUCKIN’ CAAAAALM DOWN!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo brandished his holy sword——</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sprayed Tendo&#8217;s face, which was unguarded, with the spray I had taken out of the dimensional storage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fuck—?! Wha&#8230;is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo couldn&#8217;t finish his words right to the end and collapsed on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone who had been watching the sequence of events without stopping was dazzled.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha, Haruto, what did you do? Exactly?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suzuno asked me with a slightly scary look in her eyes, and I answered her, showing her the little wonder I was holding in my hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I merely sprayed him with the slumber spray I made with my molding skill.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>NAME:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></p></td><td><p><b>Slumber spray</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>RARITY: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></p></td><td><p><b>Artifact</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>NOTES:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></p></td><td><p><b>A one-push type slumber spray made by mixing a number of sleeping pills.</b></p><p><b>Helps relieve fatigue and enables good sleep.

It&#8217;s nothing. I just put the beast to sleep because it seemed to be going crazy.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh I see&#8230;hmm? The beast?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Never mind&#8230;so, what was the talk about?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes. Well——&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I finished listening to Ephyr’s story and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In other words, you want me to train the elves in the village?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that they want to raise the level of their strength in order to attack Glicente.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s true that if the five from today are the strongest among them, then even with me in their ranks, there would be deaths in places far out of my reach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. No matter what&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ephyr looked apologetic, but there was no way I was going to leave her people to die.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand the gist of it. I&#8217;ll train them if you want me to. How long are we looking at?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you very much. I was told a month. And at the same time, they will be making preparations.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmmm. A month huh, just barely enough to get going, but I’ll figure something out.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that&#8217;s the case, said Finne.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’ll join you in the training&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll just watch——&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Princess?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;C-Count me in too!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll join you&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;In addition, it looked like Iris and Asha would be joining in.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I was thinking of training them both, so it was just perfect.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after some discussion, it was decided that Kusel and the heroes would also participate. Tendo, who was sleeping, was forced to participate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was decided that the training would start the next day, and Ephyr left the house again to tell Aegan and the others about it, and we went back to our respective rooms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I entered the room, I thought about the training program.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmmm, I need to build up their stamina. It would be good if I could properly make use of the Sea of Trees well&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I checked the topography of the Sea of Trees on the map and thought of a route to take.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve heard that there are monsters in the Sea of Trees, and running while defeating them should give a good combat experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also a good way to train teamwork when working in a party, and hopefully they would learn some skills that will be of use in battle, like detecting signs of life.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For now, the distance on this course will be&#8230;twenty kilometers should be just about right. A kilometer dash, then a kilometer run——nah, a hundred meters seems perfect”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, I meticulously formulated the training program.</span></p>
