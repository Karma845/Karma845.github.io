<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; A New Departure<h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, the prime minister, the ministers, Glifas, Marvelle, and other important people of the country were all gathered in front of the royal castle to see us off as we were about to leave.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, sir Haruto, for saving our country. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of those who are not present here.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister bowed deeply, and the other ministers followed suit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please raise your head, it wasn’t anything that serious.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister raised his head and said, &#8220;No, that’s not true&#8221;, before continuing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is regrettable that after so much you have done for us, we cannot even give you something in return.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other ministers seemed to feel the same way and had apologetic expressions on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. It can also be seen from another perspective, that if I hadn&#8217;t done what I did, you wouldn&#8217;t be in such a mess. In which case, you don’t have to go through all that trouble.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for your consideration&#8230;and as for the elves that sir Haruto brought with him&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, right. I&#8217;m going to leave them here to keep an eye on the queen and the nobles who are doing their own thing, and if anything happens, you&#8217;ll be informed&#8230;I&#8217;ll let them know to cooperate as much as possible, so if there&#8217;s an emergency, please consult with them.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Iris opened her mouth as if she remembered something.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-14589599' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-14589599' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If something happens, you can rely on my country, the Kingdom of Perdis. We know that Haruto is related to this country, so we won&#8217;t try to take it over, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Iris&#8217;s words, the prime minister and ministers all bowed their heads and said, &#8220;Thank you”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we finished our conversation, Glifas and Marvelle approached us.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir Haruto, please take care of Tendo and the others.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I leave them to you, sir.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them bowed to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Raise your heads, both of you. I trained them thoroughly too, and I made sure they didn&#8217;t become complacent while at it. So, I’m sure they’re doing just fine in the Nargadia Labyrinth.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-Thoroughly huh&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That sounds terrifying.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them were smiling bitterly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, I had a two-on-one mock battle with these two once. I had to give it to them, they lived up to their titles as the knight captain and the chief royal wizard, or perhaps as the masters of Tendo and the other heroes, as they were quite strong&#8230;not as strong as I was though.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I&#8217;ll make sure all the other heroes return to Glicente safely. That&#8217;s why I chose the Nargadia Labyrinth, which has just the right level of difficulty.&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTg0OTI3NzE5NjEiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nargadia Labyrinth huh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them wore a complicated expression on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it? I thought it was a labyrinth with good conditions though&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nah, it’s just that, the lowest level of the Nargadia labyrinth is said to contain a sealed evil dragon. Now it&#8217;s just a myth&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;An evil dragon?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;d never even heard of such a thing. When I looked at the dungeon, I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if there was some reason why I couldn&#8217;t find the boss monster, and now this, talk about bad vibes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it will probably be just fine&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right&#8230;well, we&#8217;re on our way there now anyway, so you can relax for now.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, once again, I turned to all of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll be on our way then. Thank you all for your help.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my words, Finne, Iris, Asha, Ephyr, and Kusel bowed to everyone before getting into the carriage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I called out to Maguro.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, buddy!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We left the royal capital and were making our way through the forest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. I should inform Aegan of what happened earlier.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened earlier?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne had a question mark on top of her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Didn&#8217;t I tell the prime minister and the others that they could receive intelligence regarding Mariana and the others from them? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I channeled my magic power into the communication tool and contacted Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aegan. It&#8217;s me. Can you hear me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘W-Wait, is this, boss? What are your orders sir?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aegan seemed to be surprised by the sudden communication.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I forgot to tell you, if there is any movement from Mariana or the royalist nobles, please inform not only me but also the prime minister and relevant bodies immediately.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-68551433' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-68551433' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Aye sir.’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again with the Aye sir&#8230;oh well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cut off the communication with Aegan with a subtle feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right. I&#8217;ll let Sebas and the others know what&#8217;s going on. I’ve only contacted them once right after the attack.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh that sounds good.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, I contacted Sebas, who was staying at the Perdis mansion.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s me.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Master Haruto? What can I do for you sir?’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just left the royal capital of Glicente, so I thought I&#8217;d let you know what my plans are. I&#8217;m thinking of stopping by the Nargadia Labyrinth instead of coming back there directly.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘I see. That dungeon. I understand. Please be careful.’</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll let you know when I leave the Nargadia Labyrinth.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said and cut off communication with Sebas.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further down the road, we decided to take a break.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We parked the carriage at the side of the road and fed Maguro some fruits and vegetables, while we had a light lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, I asked Kusel.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Kusel.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This might be coming out late, but are you sure you want to continue following us? There is also the option of rejoining the Order&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said so, but she shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I&#8217;ve told you many times that I don&#8217;t have any attachments to Glicente. I just think it would be more fun to travel with Haruto and the others.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. Well, if that&#8217;s what you want, Kusel, then it’s fine.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s true. It&#8217;s more fun when it&#8217;s lively.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iris is right.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne agreed with Iris&#8217; words.

Judging from their size and mana response, they&#8217;re probably greywulfs?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If so, I&#8217;ll take care of them. You all can continue to rest.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly, it was Asha who was the first to react to my words and stood up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could only offer my condolences to Kusel, who was about to get up cheerfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can you handle it, Asha?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha nodded and moved in the direction the monsters were coming from, standing naturally without taking a stance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few moments later, the greywulfs appeared in front of our line of sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The greywulfs saw Asha as their prey, and attacked her at once, seeing as she had not even taken out her weapon and was defenseless.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Asha!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris, who had been watching over the situation, raised her voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Asha leapt and ducked the greywulfs, spinning gracefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the blink of an eye, she had eight knives lodged between her fingers on both hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then made another turn in the air and used the momentum to throw the knives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eight knives accurately pierced the greywulfs between the eyes and ended their lives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this scene, the other four were stunned.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““““Asha, I didn&#8217;t know you were this strong&#8230;””””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words synchronized splendidly. Asha retrieved the knives and wiped the blood clean.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then carefully placed them in the knife holder hidden in the skirt of her maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-Asha, is that&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris also saw the knife holder, and asked fearfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean this?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re knives.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-69793642' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-69793642' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, not that! I mean, why do you have so many of them, hidden no less?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asha was puzzled, as Iris rephrased her question so quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Should I have not&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that’s not what I mean, no&#8230;hey, Haruto! Did you know about this?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iris asked me and I nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I&#8217;m the one who gave her the knife holder.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I answered, Iris said, &#8220;Why!?”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because Asha asked me to.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. I had originally learned how to use a concealed weapon from Sebas, and after leaving Perdis, I trained while listening to Haruto’s advice!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Asha nodded cheerfully, Iris seemed unable to say anything else.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne and Ephyr were giggling, and Kusel&#8217;s eyes were shining for some reason&#8230;Umm, I think I’m going to ignore that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all this was going on, Maguro seemed to have recovered from his fatigue, so we got into the carriage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then. I guess we&#8217;d better get going.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s true. We&#8217;ve had enough rest.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, we have. I&#8217;ve never been in a dungeon before, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to it!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, I will do my best to protect you from anything.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is so exciting!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve never been in a dungeon before, so I&#8217;m kinda nervous, but&#8230;I&#8217;ll give it my best!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was followed by Finne, Iris, Asha, Kusel, and Ephyr, who all spoke with great enthusiasm.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed the reins on Maguro and raised my voice in high spirits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, shall we get going. Our destination is the Nargadia Labyrinth!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“*Neigh!*”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so we proceeded with the carriage to the Nargadia Labyrinth, which Tendo and his party were conquering.</span></p>
