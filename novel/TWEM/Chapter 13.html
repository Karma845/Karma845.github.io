<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Reunion</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—The next day.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the conference room, there were me, Finne, Iris, Asha, Ephyr, Aegan, the prime minister, ministers, the other people in charge of state administration that Mariana had assembled, and all the heroes, my classmates and Ms. Usami the teacher, including Tendo and the others.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down on the most luxurious chair—probably the king’s chair—and covered my face with a hoodie.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing me like that, and Finne and the others standing near me, the heroes other than the ministers, Tendo and the others looked at me strangely.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who is that&#8230;?&#8221;, &#8220;Looking kinda shady right?”, in the midst of the whispering, Ms. Usami opened her mouth with a determined expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, may I?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Aegan, standing beside me, answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, who&#8217;s that in the chair where the King should be sitting? It&#8217;s not His Majesty, is it&#8230;? And, we would also like to know the reason why we were called here&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ms. Usami said this, my classmates nodded in agreement, looking confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked at Tendo and the others, they looked at me and nodded, though with a smile on their faces, unlike the rest of my classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I took off my hood.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;—Yuki?!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ms. Usami saw my real face, a look of surprise appeared on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of my classmates also began to buzz.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-59804428' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-59804428' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byIKICAgICBkYXRhLWZ1bGwtd2lkdGgtcmVzcG9uc2l2ZT0idHJ1ZSI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So he was alive?!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But Princess Mariana said Yuki was dead&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, she said he was eaten by a monster, if I remember correctly?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of the confusion, Ms. Usami asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;R-Really&#8230;is that really you, Yuki?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I nodded, smiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Yes, it&#8217;s me, Ms. Usami. And it&#8217;s been a while guys”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Could also be a lookalike&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would seem that Ms. Usami has become very skeptical, as she’s finding it difficult to believe me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course not, Ms. Usami. Who would want to impersonate me? Right, Tendo?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s certainly possible to pretend to be Haruto in order to trick the heroes into using them&#8230;but rest assured Ms. Usami, everyone. He’s the real Haruto—even though he&#8217;s become way stronger than us.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I can vouch for that.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Tendo and Suzuno, who laughed at me, the teacher and my classmates seemed to believe that I was the real deal.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all had a look of relief on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at their faces, I felt bad that I had caused them more worry than I had thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed my head to everyone.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTQ1OTIyNTI5NTAiIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m sorry I made you guys worry. As you can see, I&#8217;m alive.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Scratch that, I&#8217;m just glad you&#8217;re alive, Yuki.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Orihara, the other classmates all said similar lines, ‘I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re okay’. Tendo and the others were told, &#8220;If you knew, you should have told us sooner.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were having such a picture-perfect emotional reunion, the infamous trio started to make a fuss.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How come, how are you still alive?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah! We heard you were dead!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let me guess, you’re a lookalike aren’t ya? What are you up to?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aforementioned trio are Kento Mitsurugi, Hayato Suruga, and Ryo Matsuba. They are the same ones who have been harassing me in the former world in one way or another.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did they not hear what Tendo said earlier?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I slowly gazed at the three of them and then opened my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What is it? Is it inconvenient if I&#8217;m still alive?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not what&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, actually, it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s any particular motive, they just want to get rid of me for some childish reason, I guess.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsurugi and the others flinched, but then gave a huffy look and came at me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even Ichinomiya is being manipulated by Yuki, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I bet she is!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He must have used some kind of brainwashing magic!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the words of Mitsurugi, Suruga and Matsuba, all eyes turned to Suzuno.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Tendo is not suspected huh&#8230;or rather, I’ve just been looking at them talking smack since earlier. I will never do such a thing!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? What are you all doing?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ichinonomiya, we’re going to free you from Yuki—Hiiieeek!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mitsurugi tried to approach Suzuno, he let out a scream and fell on his buttocks in the middle of his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t just Mitsurugi alone. It was the same for Suruga and Matsuba as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What the hell, is this&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Intimidation&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, I unleashed intimidation on Mitsurugi and the other three.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was also mildly directing the intimidation onto the other classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps there could still be some among them that might try coming after me. I wanted them to be made aware of the difference in our abilities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said to Mitsurugi and the other three who were on their asses.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ll explain how I&#8217;m still alive later. The reason I&#8217;ve gathered you here today is to talk about something important, so shut up the f*ck up.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What the hell are you talking about? What are you doing to—”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did I not just tell you to shut up? I don&#8217;t have the time to deal with you right now.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-75763163' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-75763163' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that, Mitsurugi finally shut up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suruga and Matsuba were also silent&#8230;or rather, they were nodding furiously, too terrified to speak, so I lifted the intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My classmates breathed a sigh of relief, they were finally released from the intimidation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked around at everyone, making sure no one opened their mouths.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Prime Minister and ministers, I&#8217;m sorry to have dragged you all into this. So, once again—thank you for gathering here today.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, the Prime Minister opened his mouth for the first time today, looking confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, we were gathered by Her Highness Mariana, where is she? I haven&#8217;t seen His Majesty or the Prince since this morning either&#8230;the castle is also in a state of disrepair, what exactly is going on here? And who might you be&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, yeah, I know they all have a lot of questions. Where do I even begin&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, let me start by introducing myself. I&#8217;m Haruto Yuki. I was summoned to this world alongside Tendo and the others, guess you could say I didn’t turn out to be a hero like the rest. I&#8217;ve been an adventurer since Mariana kicked me out of the castle. My rank is EX.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ministers and my classmates buzzed at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What, you&#8217;re the EX rank adventurer that emerged just recently!?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I heard his name, I thought it would be unusual for him to have the same name&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I also received the reports of the hero who left the castle on his own and died, but&#8230;what do you mean Princess Mariana kicked you out?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa, whoa, are you kidding me?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I never thought that the world&#8217;s strongest adventurer who saved the Perdis royal capital was someone that was summoned by Glicente…”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait a minute, wasn’t that EX rank who we now know to be Haruto, called the &#8216;Demon King&#8217; or something.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, the heroes and ministers alike looked at each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reaction of my classmates was particularly striking, and they couldn&#8217;t hide their surprise that I, who had been called ‘Incompetent’, was now the ‘World&#8217;s strongest’.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed to be getting out of hand, so I pulled out my jet-black adventurer&#8217;s card made of orichalcon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the proof of my EX rank. I was actually supposed to be promoted to S rank, but due to various reasons, King Dillan of the Kingdom of Perdis just happened to push me for EX rank.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finne laughed at my words and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not something that can be summed up to &#8216;just happened’ though, while Iris was like “Since it’s Haruto, it’s only natural”, she said proudly.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this exchange, the ministers and my classmates all seemed to believe that I was indeed an EX rank.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having resolved the issue with my identity, one of the ministers raised his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-So, Mister Haruto. Where is His Majesty the King, His Royal Highness Heelis and Her Royal Highness Mariana&#8230;?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The King and the First Prince died last night. Mariana is alive, but I have not allowed her to join us here today.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I replied thus, the place was in an uproar again. Well, that&#8217;s the kind of reaction you get when someone suddenly tells you that their king and their crowned prince are dead.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What exactly is going on here? Does it have anything to do with the fact that the castle is in disrepair!?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one who shouted that was the Prime Minister.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re all pretty gritty stuff that could probably send anyone into a panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right&#8230;first of all, do you know that more than a year ago, the royal family used some of their soldiers to attack the elven village?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister and a few of the ministers nodded bitterly at my question, while the rest shook their heads with wide eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I checked with God Eye, and they didn&#8217;t seem to be lying.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-47449626' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-47449626' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSczJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI2MTA1NjkzNDA2Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You really don&#8217;t know anything about it&#8230;I stomped into the castle last night with the survivors of the elven village. I knew that the royals were behind it, and I myself had a grudge against the king who forced the hero summoning and Mariana for kicking me out.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all listened to me with a mysterious look on their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, when I finally got the royals in custody, the first prince and some of the royals turned into Yvels—monsters that appeared in the city in the middle of the night. I was told that there was no way to transform back, so I had no choice but to kill them. As for the king&#8230;he didn&#8217;t turn into a Yvel, but I had him fall to the sword. If I let him live, the reign of terror and violence in this country will not end.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Did you kill him, Mister Haruto?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, the king fell at the hands of an elf.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That elf is Ephyr beside me, but I won&#8217;t say that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister nodded his head in satisfaction with my answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I see. As for me, I tried to stop the attack on the elven village, but&#8230; this may very well sound like an excuse, but the power of the king was quite strong in this country. Even I, the Prime Minister, and the high officials like the ministers here, were unable to stop it.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister looked apologetic as he said this.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then bowed his head to Ephyr and Aegan.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If I may, the two of you are elves, right? I am truly sorry that we could not stop the king from attacking your village.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other ministers bowed as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ephyr and Aegan shook their heads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No&#8230;some of you didn&#8217;t even know about it, so please&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In addition, it seems that the people who attacked the village were under the First Prince&#8217;s command, but last night&#8217;s commotion turned most of them into Yvel and we were able to defeat them. We still have to track down our enslaved brethren, though&#8230;but as far as the Elven Village is concerned, our revenge on this nation has been accomplished.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Ephyr nor Aegan seemed to have any intention of hurting innocent people. Well, if they did, they would be no different from those royals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing their words, the prime minister and the rest bowed their heads even more deeply.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, the king is dead. The surviving members of the royal family, including Mariana, have been restricted in their activities by means of slavery. And from now on, I want you guys to run the government for the people and rebuild this country. Of course, I&#8217;m going to lend my assistance as well.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister and the others were delighted when I said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now the people won’t have to suffer anymore&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them even shed tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from the reactions of the Prime Minister and the ministers earlier, it seems that the royal family was quite disliked.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many core members of the administration, I would have thought that there would be a few close to the royal family&#8230;but from the looks of it, it seems that the only ones skimming the cream off the economy were the royals, while these guys wanted to do something to save their people.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the fact that the people are suffering all over means that&#8230;most of the nobles who are lords are probably on the side of the royal family.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure there are many more problems to be dealt with, I sighed, opening my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay then, let&#8217;s get down to it. The reason I asked you all to gather here today is because I wanted you to know what&#8217;s going on and to decide what to do going forward.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cut my speech and looked around at everyone’s faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First things first, telling the people about the situation, that the king died of a sudden illness, and several members of the royal family, including the prince, were so distraught with grief that they took their own lives. The new king is&#8230;we can choose a random member of the royal family. If we choose the young prince, it might give the impression of a coup d&#8217;etat, so I guess we’ll go with Mariana. Although she’ll basically be a figurehead with no power whatsoever, and in a way where the people will never find out.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She reacted subtly to my question yesterday, but now that she has been engraved with a slave crest, she won&#8217;t try to defy me anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister nodded at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, she was only good at keeping appearances&#8230;so I&#8217;m sure there will be little opposition from the people.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-98286701' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-98286701' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc0JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI1NTg2ODE4NjUwIj48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, so I was right then. Thought as much.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, then, let&#8217;s go with that. Also, regarding the mass outbreak of Yvel last night, obviously it was the work of the demon tribe, but how about we spin it, that it was suppressed by the brave heroes and the elves. This will make it easier for the heroes and the elves to move around the country in the future&#8230; Keep the information under control, please.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All that is left is, internal administration&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister nodded at my murmur.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right&#8230;but first, let me explain to you again how this country works.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister prefaced his explanation by giving me the general gist of the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In this country, each territory is run by nobles, but the king decides the policy of the whole country. Naturally, however, the king could not manage all of them by himself, so he appointed ministers for each field and officials worked under them. The king&#8217;s policies are then communicated to the nobles in each territory&#8230;well, simply put, the ministers only move the officials in order to implement the policy unilaterally decided by the king and the royal family.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoa, what’s this gloomy atmosphere! Talk about spooky!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was the job of the ministers to protect the lives of the people and keep the country from collapsing while listening to the royal family&#8217;s selfishness&#8230; Can&#8217;t even count the number of times I wished for everything to just go to sh*t.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The minister beside the Prime Minister muttered such a thing. Dude, that’s too dark!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-All right, so&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I flinched and urged the Prime Minister to go on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. Just as he said, the ministers sometimes resisted the demands of the royal family in order to protect the people. As a result, when it came to military and financial matters, as well as judicial and legislative matters, the royal family had complete control over the ministerial positions. By the way, the defense minister was the first prince.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, with those four things in their grip, they can do as they please.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, owning to the efforts of the officials under the ministers, the people were not subjected to excessive irrationality&#8230;the knight captain and the court magician both disliked the royal family&#8217;s selfishness personally, so it seems that they were able to adjust well while obeying superficially.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, the knight captain, if I’m not mistaken, is the same one that Kusel said she was proud of.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tendo and the other heroes also reacted to the words Knight Captain and Court Magician.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So now that the royal family has lost its power, ministers for those four areas need to be appointed as soon as possible. Also, there is no one in charge of agriculture&#8230;as for the rest, we can manage with the people present here.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm? No one?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s right. There used to be a minister, but he was beheaded when the king insisted that the harvest be tripled in order to increase the tax revenue. Naturally, no one was willing to take his place, so one of the royal family members took over. He did not have any knowledge of agriculture, let alone the ability to motivate people to do what he wanted, so in effect, the ministry was run by officials without a real minister.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Wow, that’s so messed up.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes it is, sadly so.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister chuckled.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from what I&#8217;ve heard, it seems that if the top management is solid, the country will be just fine.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there will be royalists* among the officials, but&#8230;as long as they are investigated and eliminated, there will be no problem. (TLN: Factions that supports the royal family)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, thank you, Prime Minister. As for the military, finance, judiciary, legislature, and agriculture positions, we&#8217;ll find new fit for them&#8230;wow, we’ve covered quite a lot, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must be lunchtime, I could hear the sound of growling stomachs here and there.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a lunch break then. The Ministers should please return after the break. As for the rest, you&#8217;re free to do whatever you&#8230;oh right, I’ll be seeing the guys from class in the evening, so please stay around—dismissed!”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">～</span></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the lunch break, I came back to the conference room.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I dismissed everyone, Finne, Iris, Suzuno, Asha, Kusel, and Ephyr were following me.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aren&#8217;t you bored? I asked them, but Finne replied and said, &#8220;I just want to be near Haruto”.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think I can chase her away after saying something like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when the Prime Minister and his colleagues returned with some new faces, we resumed the meeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now, to continue where we left off&#8230;any ideas or recommendations?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said that, the Prime Minister nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes sir. First of all, for the finance, judiciary, and legislative affairs, we don&#8217;t know how many royalists are among the officials who have been subordinates to the respective ministers, so it&#8217;s risky to choose from among them. However, these three are currently serving in other ministerial positions, but they have experience as ministers of finance, justice, and legislative affairs, so we will have them take office. Let them nominate their most trusted subordinates for the vacant ministerial positions.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, it&#8217;s reassuring to have someone with experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea, let&#8217;s go with that&#8230;by the way, what&#8217;s the current financial situation?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re just getting by.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve also heard that the country is exploiting them.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister&#8217;s face twisted at my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, since the king took over, various taxes have been increased and the tax revenue has more than doubled. However, the amount of money that goes to running the country has not increased that much&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You mean it&#8217;s all going into the pockets of the nobles and royals?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'><div class="ai-lazy" data-code="PGlmcmFtZSBzdHlsZT0id2lkdGg6IDEwMCU7IGhlaWdodDogMHB4OyIgc3JjPSJodHRwczovL3NoaW50cmFuc2xhdGlvbnMuY29tL3dwLWFkbWluL2FkbWluLWFqYXgucGhwP2FjdGlvbj1haV9hamF4JmJsb2NrPTEmcm5kPTk3OTAzMDA1MDciIG1hcmdpbmhlaWdodD0iMCIgbWFyZ2lud2lkdGg9IjAiIGZyYW1lYm9yZGVyPSIwIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBvbmxvYWQ9ImFpX3Jlc2l6ZV9pZnJhbWUgKHRoaXMpOyI+PC9pZnJhbWU+Cg==" data-class="Y29kZS1ibG9jaw=="></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see&#8230;if that&#8217;s the case, there won&#8217;t be any hindrance to the operation of the state, so we&#8217;ll restore the tax rates first. As for the details regarding budgets and whatnot, I&#8217;m more or less an amateur, so I&#8217;ll leave that to you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Minister of Finance nodded vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Iris raised her voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Haruto, what about the royalist nobles? I think there are probably some who are taking advantage of the additional taxes.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s very perceptive, coming from you, Iris!</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Oh, right, I keep forgetting that she&#8217;s a princess. She must have studied politics at some point.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right. We&#8217;d better set up a system to make sure the flow of funds is transparent, and then investigate each noble strictly again.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there are any royalists who have something to hide, they will be dissatisfied with this reform, so it should be easy to identify them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance nodded when I gave them a look.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, then, let&#8217;s move on to agriculture&#8230;are there any candidates?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. In place of the royal family, who did very little work, we have brought in a man who was practically the head of the ministry organizing the officials.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Prime Minister said this, a young man who had not been present in the morning stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My name is Lemurt. I am a noble now, but I used to be a farmer, and I was hired to be the facilitator because of my knowledge and experience. I will give it my best.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m Haruto, I’ll be counting on you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was speaking to Lemrut, who bowed his head, Suzuno uttered, &#8220;Oh”.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-65161899' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-65161899' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s the matter, Suzuno?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Come to think of it, weren&#8217;t there two people in our class whose parents are farmers?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, now that she mentioned it, I think there were. This might be convenient.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Lemurt, there are two heroes who might have some knowledge of agriculture. I&#8217;ll check with them later and send them to you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow! This means that I might be able to gain knowledge of agriculture from another world?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemurt&#8217;s face lit up.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup, just as he said, he might be able to gain something useful from Earth&#8217;s agricultural knowledge.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the classmates in question may not know that much about farming, since they don’t do it themselves&#8230; I&#8217;ll just have to hope for the best.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good. Now all that&#8217;s left is the military&#8230;this is the tricky part.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, the first prince was the minister. If we choose the wrong person, he might go out of control too.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Tendo asked the Prime Minister.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What about the Knight Captain Glifas?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, the minister is not in charge of the actual work, but rather the overall coordination of the organization of the army. Also, this country has military and security organizations separate from the Knights, and they need to be managed as well&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking over the words of the Prime Minister, a man in his late thirties, who had been silent for a long time, opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think that Captain Glifas is capable of performing his duties as a minister, but the Knight Order still needs that man.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-3-99467763' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-3-99467763' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSczJyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI2MTA1NjkzNDA2Ij48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='3'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='3' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um&#8230;who might you be?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think he was present in the morning either&#8230;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haruto, his name is Dazan. He&#8217;s a former knight commander who joined the order around the same time as me.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while, Ex-Vice Captain Kusel—Apologies Mr. Haruto, I’m late in my greetings. My name is Dazan.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right, I’ll be counting on you then&#8230;by the way, why did you quit the Order?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazan nodded in response to my question.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s for the same reason as Ex-Vice Captain Kusel. I was ordered to raid the elven village, a mission in which I could not possibly participate&#8230;”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dazan is good at interpersonal relationships. He was the so-called middle manager, a coordinator between the upper echelons of the Order and the rest.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds just like the minister I just heard about, doesn’t it?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, and sometimes I was also in charge of planning operations&#8230;so, when I had to quit after Kusel, captain Glifas cried out to me. But, for the same reason as Kusel, I couldn&#8217;t tell the Knight Captain why&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister smiled in response to Dazan’s words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was also visited by the knight captain about the fact that the vice captain possessing high fighting ability and the excellent coordinator were both leaving the knight order at the same time. I was also apprised of the plan, so I couldn&#8217;t really say anything&#8230;that&#8217;s why I thought it would be a good idea to make Dazan the Minister of Military Affairs, and brought him here.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, that explains it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you certainly seem to have a lot of talent and experience, from what I&#8217;ve heard&#8230;Dazan, are you up for this?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would be my pleasure sir!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazan nodded vigorously.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-64876539' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-64876539' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay, so we have our ministers. I&#8217;ll leave the management to you&#8230;although, there&#8217;s one more thing I&#8217;d like to propose.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it, if I may ask?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister tilted his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I want to free those who have been unjustly enslaved, human and subhuman alike. Of course, this does not mean that we will be doing away with slavery altogether. Criminal slaves are integrated into society as a labor force after all.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see, let&#8217;s move forward with that as well&#8230;it seems that the competence of each minister will be tested in various areas.”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prime Minister seemed somewhat amused by my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, they would have been held back by the royal family, who were mired in self-interest. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s looking forward to doing all the things he’s capable of with excitement.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, that&#8217;s right.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Listen, everyone, I, Tendo, and the other heroes possess knowledge of another world. Although we were still in the process of being educated, many of us have ideas that do not exist in this world and wisdom created by our predecessors in the other world.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I broke off my words and looked around at the ministers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So go out there and talk to them. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll have something useful for you.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“““Yes sir!”””</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyes of the ministers shone brightly as they replied in unison.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the new Glicente Kingdom had taken its first step.</span></p>
