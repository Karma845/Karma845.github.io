<h3>Chapter 4 – Break up with me.</h3>

					
<p>I turned on the shower faucet and let the water run over my head, causing the shampoo suds to drip down the drain. The spacious bathtub and the many amenities in the room were only a prelude to what we were about to do.</p>



<p>At first, I thought this was simply a crazy and absurd decision made under the influence of alcohol by two girls who did not have full use of reason. I can even assure you that I saw a rather unusual tension between the two of them when they were bathing together in the whirlpool. </p>



<p>After that they came out of the bath with a bathrobe on and got into bed while watching very explicit content on the TV. I was sitting on the couch as I tried to analyze everything that was happening. Was this a test? Was it really going to happen? I was looking for hidden messages, and nothing was far from the truth, Both Hayasaka-san and Tachibana-san were serious when they both contacted their families and said they would stay at each other’s house. </p>


<p>And of course, they were no longer called “Hikari-chan” or “Akane-chan”. The honorifics again took presence among their vocabularies and they referred to each other by their surnames. In other words, the effect of alcohol has disappeared from their behavior. Many doubts arose in my head. What happened to the rule of not going all the way? Do they no longer trust each other? It seems crazy to me that they both want to do this at the same time. I guess there is no specific reason.         I decided to forget about it and turned off the shower faucet. I cleaned my body, put on my underwear and then my bathrobe. I dried my hair and returned to the bedroom.</p>



<p>The lights were dimmed, and both girls were tucked into bed under the comforter covered up to their heads. I think the side effects of the alcohol started to take hold of them and they’ve fallen asleep… In that case, I’ll sleep on the couch. The heater is set to a very high temperature, and I don’t think I’ll catch a cold sleeping without a blanket. </p>



<p>—Shirou-kun, where are you going? It’s your turn to be in the middle. — <em>Tachibana-san said while grabbing my arm.</em></p>


<p>—It’s okay, I can…</p>



<p>—I don’t want you to pretend that you’re happy with sleeping on the couch all night. Or do you really intend to tell me that you’re satisfied with that?</p>



<p>As soon as she said those words, I had no choice but to crawl into the bed. Once inside, both Hayasaka-san and Tachibana-san took off their bathrobes, and I could tell that they were only wearing their undergarments. Everything was so tight that I could touch their bodies. </p>



<p>—Are you sure you want to do this?</p>


<p>—Yes. We are your girlfriends after all. — <em>Hayasaka-san replied. </em></p>



<p>—But in circumstances like this…</p>



<p>—Does it seem strange to you that it’s the three of us? Maybe you’re right to think so. But we’ve also been abstaining from our desires for a long time, haven’t we? So, why act or pretend like this shouldn’t be a normal thing?  </p>



<p>Hayasaka-san poked her head out of the comforter, and turned up the lighting in the room, causing the dim atmosphere to disappear.</p>



<p>—Tachibana-san, let’s teach Kirishima-kun properly.</p>



<p>—…I agree.</p>



<p>Both of them got up, and knelt in front of me, revealing their bodies.</p>



<p>—I—It’s a little more embarrassing than I imagined. — <em>Hayasaka-san said, turning her head to the side.</em></p>



<p>—Y—Yes… Me too. — <em>Tachibana-san replied, hiding her breasts and with a red face. </em></p>



<p>—If you’re so embarrassed, you don’t have to….</p>



<p>—No! I… I want you to see me.</p>



<p>Tachibana-san’s eyes dart in all directions around the room. She is very embarrassed, but her feelings of love are stronger. And on the other hand, Hayasaka-san was still imposing without covering any part of her body.</p>



<p>—I’ve been preparing for this moment. It takes a lot of courage to have you see me like this now.</p>



<p>The type of lingerie they both wore, was very provocative, the kind I wouldn’t expect two girls their age to wear.</p>



<p>—Tachibana-san, lately I’ve been wearing this kind of underwear all the time. That’s why the girls chickened out on me in the locker room when I was changing out of my PE clothes. And so did you, because you were expecting to do this with Kirishima-kun at any time, right?</p>



<p>—Yes…</p>



<p>—I’m embarrassed too, but I’m willing to make this happen. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that you feel shy, but it’s for the sake of pleasing the person we like. And that’s why we are here.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san approaches me on all fours and whispers in my ear.</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun, surely, you’re thinking that by doing this, you can atone for your sins for everything that’s happened, right?</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san’s expression becomes increasingly sensual.</p>


<p>—Both me and Tachibana-san are broken.</p>



<p>I looked at Tachibana-san, although she was still adopting her coy pose, her eyes had become very cold. She seemed to despise the idea of me making so many excuses to not do this with them, even though they had been trying so hard to want to please me. </p>



<p>—Hey, what do you want, Kirishima-kun?  </p>



<p>Hayasaka-san asked while whispering in my ear again. </p>



<p>—If you won’t be a man of words. Break up with me now.</p>


<p>After those words, I got up, and slipped my hand into her underwear as I kissed her.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/LdQ6jPK/sg-vol3-02.png" alt="sg-vol3-02" border="0"></a>



<p>I chose Hayasaka-san for the simple reason that she was the closest to me. While holding her waist, she remained on her knees with her legs spread and my other hand inside her underwear. </p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun, doing that, and in this position? </p>



<p>She had been very surprised that I had touched her like that and so suddenly. But after a few seconds she relaxed. I could feel the warmth and wetness on my fingertips. I started to move my fingers slowly, making them wetter and wetter. Hayasaka-san closes her eyes and lets out a sweet sigh as she wiggles her hips.</p>



<p>—This… This is what I always wanted… To be with Kirishima-kun in a love hotel… And for him to be inside of me….</p>


<p>I pulled my hands out of Hayasaka-san’s underwear, and the liquid on my fingers was stringy.</p>



<p>—Don’t stop…</p>



<p>—Do you want to go all the way?</p>



<p>—Yes, but…</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san leans on me as if she’s on the defensive, and while hugging me, she turned to look at Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>—I’ll go first.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san’s eyes had a slightly triumphant tinge. Their gazes met and sparks seemed to fly. However, Tachibana-san accepted her request with a dissatisfied expression. She could do nothing else, except just watch from a short distance. She sat on the ground while grabbing the blanket and hid her body while looking at us greedily. </p>



<p>I hugged Hayasaka-san’s body. The room was warm, making her body slightly sweaty. I roughly grabbed her breasts, which were about to pop out in front of her underwear.</p>



<p>—I won’t hold back anymore.</p>



<p>—It’s okay, Kirishima-kun, you got what you had wished for, two girls madly in love with you and you can now do whatever you want with them.</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san is right, I am in a position where everything is in my favor. From the beginning I have always tried to seek forgiveness from both of them while enjoying all carnal desires. Pretending to be unhappy, rather hypocritical, right?</p>



<p>They realized my intentions, and lest it continue to happen, this was the result. Having two beautiful women as my girlfriends, all because I was indecisive and didn’t make a decision from the beginning. Now, both Hayasaka-san and Tachibana-san have allowed me to taste the forbidden fruit, something that I personally could not deliberately do, even though they are both in love with me, it would be taking advantage of them, more than I have. I’ve been a complete idiot, but that attitude has gotten me this far. I unfastened Hayasaka-san’s bra, and slipped my hands in while playing with her breasts at my whim.</p>



<p>—I won’t take it all off.</p>



<p>—It’s okay, Kirishima-kun…. I want you to get excited, I bought these clothes for you… Ah… You can… Take them off… Aah… Kirishima-kun… </p>



<p>—You don’t have to hold your voice.</p>


<p>I touched her nipples, that made them get hard instantly.</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun… This feels so… So… So… So good… Aaah….</p>



<p>Drunk with pleasure. Hayasaka-san started to raise her voice and say things she normally wouldn’t say. </p>



<p>I remembered the cold look Tachibana-san gave me earlier, so I positioned myself in such a way that Tachibana-san could observe without disdain everything I do to Hayasaka-san. I grabbed her breasts with my left hand, at the same time slipping my right hand into her underwear below, and proceeded to make slow movements with my fingers in Hayasaka-san’s hot and wet area.</p>



<p>Tachibana-san’s expression was indescribable. It was a combination of jealousy, frustration and curiosity, this while rubbing her thighs. Hayasaka-san, aware of this, began to pant at a more exaggerated rate.</p>


<p>—Kirishima-kun, you’re amazing… Don’t stop, keep it up, do it harder… Aaah….</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san’s inside is so hot that it’s burning my fingers, not to mention that it also feels softer than before, my fingers no longer feel like they’re in a tight place.</p>



<p>I was not only pulling my fingers out and putting them back in, I was also moving them back and forth. Which caused Hayasaka-san’s body to react to the stimulation, and an indescribable sound starts to generate inside her.</p>



<p>—No, Kirishima-kun… Don’t make that noise… It’s so embarrassing… Aaah….</p>



<p>Her body was getting even sweatier, I started kissing her while sucking her tongue and continued touching her whole body at my whim. </p>



<p>—Aaah… Kirishima-kun… I… I am Kirishima-kun’s toy….</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san was really enjoying showing Tachibana-san how I was touching her and doing whatever I wanted with her body. Usually she felt defeated by Tachibana-san, she even felt guilt because Tachibana-san agreed to share me with her. But not now, now she did not feel guilt or remorse, Hayasaka-san felt like a winner.</p>



<p>—Hayasaka-san, stick out your tongue more.</p>



<p>Honestly, it didn’t make me happy at all that Tachibana-san was still in contact with Yanagi-senpai, let alone that she hid from me the fact that they walked hand in hand. So this was my way of getting back at her.</p>



<p>She may bring up reasons like her family situation with Yanagi-senpai’s, or the fact that we did something much worse to Yanagi-senpai that day on stage. Or maybe she’ll be able to act like it’s no big deal. But she was also the one who has asked me for honesty and openness. So, now it’s my turn to show her how I feel about Hayasaka-san. </p>


<p>—H—Hey… You two… I think you are overdoing it… — <em>expressed Tachibana-san with much hesitation chastising herself from watching what we were doing. </em></p>



<p>Tachibana-san is a girl who has a tendency to be forced to do things she is embarrassed or doesn’t want to do. So, deep down she feels very excited about this. And that’s evident from the frustrated look on her face, her reddened cheeks, and her slender fingers wiggling in her underwear hidden under the sheets. When I move my fingers violently in Hayasaka-san’s underwear, Tachibana-san’s fingers replicate such an act with the same violence.</p>



<p>The room was hot and humid. The perfect environment for the three of us to indulge in perverse pleasures. The characteristic sound made by Hayasaka-san’s secret and special place becomes more intense, but not only that, that same sound was also mixed with those made by Tachibana-san. Making everything feel very lustful.</p>



<p>—No, no, no, no, no… Kirishima-kun, I feel like I’m going to… Aaah… Aaaaah… Kirishima-kun!!!!</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san leaned forward as her body trembled. Drops start to fall on the sheets from her underwear. And Tachibana-san, who had been touching herself, also shook her body at the same time and pulled her body back ecstatically. Three agitated breaths invade the room. But it wasn’t all over, now the night was only beginning.</p>


<p>—This time I will be the one to make Kirishima-kun feel good. — <em>Hayasaka-san said as she remained with all her weight on me and an expression of pleasure</em> — I like you very much, I will use my body to make you feel good.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san seemed to have lost the use of reason, she started riding on top of me while rubbing her crotch, and licking me all over. Her sweaty thighs overlapping mine, at the same time I feel something soft and wet beyond her underwear.</p>



<p>The combination of all these kinds of acts made the inevitable happen, something grew in my crotch, making clear contact between our parts. This made a strong feeling of satisfaction invade her body and of course, her eyes showed it.</p>



<p>—Is that what I think it is…? Kirishima-kun, you’re excited, right? It’s because you’re attracted to me, right?</p>



<p>—Yes. I’m attracted to you, Hayasaka-san.</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san’s messy look is erotic. I feel a great urge to take my desires out on her, so I press my crotch into hers.</p>



<p>—Aaah…. Kirishima-kun… Do you really want to do it?</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san slightly lifts her body and starts to move her hips. Our crotches collide with each other, and the act of rubbing became intense. Hayasaka-san looks at Tachibana-san and smiles listlessly, in turn, Tachibana-san looks angry, but continues to wiggle her fingers.</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun, make me feel better, make me feel better with my body.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san comes closer to me and kisses me. I was so excited by the rubbing of our bodies that my mind was clouding. I just wanted to keep experiencing this feeling, I deliberately stuck out my tongue, Hayasaka-san took advantage of the moment and started to suck it hard. We were both very sweaty and our body fluids were mixing. </p>



<p>I grabbed her breasts again and squeezed them harder. Hayasaka-san moans in a high pitched and lovely voice. Sweat starts to slide down her cheek and falls on my chest, and my underwear became wet from the liquid that has been leaking from Hayasaka-san’s crotch.</p>


<p>—Don’t hold back, Kirishima-kun, do whatever you want with me.</p>



<p>I was doing everything that crossed my mind in Hayasaka-san’s body. Both she and I were at our limit, she just kept panting and moving her hips. Until at one point, she couldn’t take it anymore…</p>



<p>—Hayasaka-san, I… I’m at my limit…</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you!</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san’s whole body was trembling as she screamed… As was I. I had cum in my underwear, all the pleasure I felt made me fall back on the bed limply.</p>



<p>—This… It was amazing… I keep thinking of you, Kirishima-kun…</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san was in a complete state of shock. And her expression was simply sexy. Her mouth was half open, and with wet hair sticking to her cheeks. </p>



<p>And I was so dizzy that I couldn’t think of or say anything.</p>



<p>—You enjoyed it too, didn’t you Kirishima-kun? That makes me happy… That’s proof of it… </p>


<p>Hayasaka-san puts her hand inside my underwear, with empty eyes, and then licks that same hand that had traces of my happiness.</p>



<p>—I want you to put this inside me.</p>



<p>—What?</p>



<p>—Don’t hold back… Do it.</p>



<p>Despite how weak I felt, I could perfectly understand that what Hayasaka-san said was something out of the ordinary.</p>


<p>—If Kirishima-kun gets inside me, it will be something that would make me very happy. I’m sure I fell madly in love with you to the point of no return, and I wouldn’t have eyes for any other guy.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san’s eyes denoted madness. So, it wasn’t just words, and she began to touch my body with an ecstatic expression.</p>



<p>—I know that with you, I will feel very good, because I like you very much. So, I want to do it with you… You, don’t you want to do it too?</p>



<p>I imagined what it would be like to do it, what it would be like to enter inside Hayasaka-san, to feel her insides, to embrace her hot and wet body very tightly. To kiss her beautiful lips and be with each other. That would feel like one of the greatest pleasures. </p>



<p>—I’ll fall more in love with you, Kirishima-kun. I will be crazy and lost for you. — <em>She said as she pressed her crotch into mine again.</em> — I know you will love it, because you have shown me that you really like me, that I turn you on. We are definitely right for each other.</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san starts to move her hips again, perhaps imagining what comes next.</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun, Kirishima-kun… Aah… Aaaah… This… This feels amazing… I’m so happy, I want to feel Kirishima-kun inside me, I want you inside me, I want to go crazy, I want to feel you very deep inside me…!</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san put her hand on her underwear, and slid it to the side. There was no stopping what was about to come, and if I pulled back, I was going to hurt her badly.</p>



<p>—…That’s enough.</p>



<p>A cold voice echoed in the feverish room. It was Tachibana-san, she was holding Hayasaka-san’s arm tightly.</p>


<p>—Enough is enough!</p>



<p>—No! I will definitely do it with Kirishima-kun!</p>



<p>But Hayasaka-san didn’t flinch at Tachibana-san’s clear anger. She was like a spoiled child that was having her cookie taken away from her. At this, she continued to ignore Tachibana-san’s request, and proceeded to take my underwear, and move it down, but before it happened completely… A snapping sound was heard in the room. </p>



<p>Tachibana-san was so furious that she slapped Hayasaka-san. That brought me back to reality too, and I couldn’t help but worry if everything would get out of control next, but Hayasaka-san started laughing while holding her cheek. </p>



<p>—I knew it, I knew from the beginning that we weren’t going to go all the way the moment we walked in here… And it’s because you want to be the first, isn’t it, Tachibana-san? I know… I know you go through the same thing as me. You know that you won’t be able to forget Kirishima-kun as soon as you do, you won’t be able to leave him for anything in the world. And much less, you won’t want to share him with anyone. Right, Tachibana-san? I know you think like that, and it’s because… I would do the same thing too.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMgf8xq/sg-vol3-03.png" alt="sg-vol3-03" border="0"></a>


<p>The sun was up, and we were going straight home on the first train out of the station. There was no one else on the train carriage, and the only noise we could hear was the wheels spinning at high speed on the tracks. The sky began to turn white, and conversations between us were scarce. We just stared out the window. </p>



<p>After last night, we all calmed down and reflected on what had happened. Tachibana-san apologized to Hayasaka-san for slapping her, while Hayasaka-san and I apologized to Tachibana-san for indulging in immoral pleasure in front of her. Our actions have consequences, and those were two other rules added to this relationship. The first was to prohibit alcohol. I could already see that both girls are not qualified to handle those damn drinks. </p>



<p>And the second, as expected, was to prohibit any act that invites carnal acts. This was suggested by Tachibana-san, neither I nor Hayasaka-san could protest her request. And since we did whatever we wanted in front of her without any remorse, a rule of equality was imposed. Only one more perverted thing would be allowed to happen, but only with Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>With those points on the table. No one said anything else, we each showered separately, put on suitable clothes that would not invite arousing obscene desires, and went to bed at a distance far enough away from each other. When we woke up in the morning, we just believed that everything that had happened last night was just a dream.</p>



<p>—I guess we don’t have to force this to continue anymore. — <em>said Tachibana-san as she approached the station where she was going to get off.</em></p>


<p>—I agree. —<em> replied Hayasaka-san with a languid expression.</em> — If something like last night happens again, we’ll end up fighting each other.</p>



<p>—Then, do you agree that Shirou-kun should make a decision before Christmas?</p>



<p>—Yes, that’s how it should be.</p>



<p>—Good. This is where I get off.</p>



<p>The train stopped, and Tachibana-san got up from her seat. Before she headed for the door, she looked at me with an expression on her face of wanting to say something, but in the end, she turned her back on me and got off. The doors closed and the train started moving again.</p>


<p>—You’ve made an important decision quickly.</p>



<p>—Yes… You know something, Kirishima-kun? I’ll cry if you don’t choose me.</p>



<p>—And now you’ve just added a whole lot of pressure on me now…</p>



<p>—Hehe…</p>



<p>It’s no laughing matter for me. I was given the choice of who I’m going to spend Christmas with. Someone will be heartbroken, and it gives me a headache just thinking about it.</p>


<p>—Relax, I know you’ll end up choosing Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>—I like you very much, Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>—But your favorite person is Tachibana-san. That’s why you try to calmly resolve the situation at her house, right? Even last night, when you heard that Tachibana-san was still in contact with Yanagi-senpai, you weren’t surprised at all… I know…    I know that you’re still in contact with him, even after what happened at the festival.</p>
