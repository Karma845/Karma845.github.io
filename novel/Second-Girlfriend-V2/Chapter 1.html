<h3>Chapter 1 – Weak.</h3>

<p>After school, I headed home as I walked along with Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>It was very cold in the air, and after every exhale, her breath could be seen in the air with a faint white color. She was wearing a gray coat, and a white plaid scarf. But all was not well.</p>



<p>—I see you’re angry.</p>



<p>—What a good observer you are. — <em>She replied as she continued to stare straight ahead with an angry expression.</em> —We’re sweethearts, we should hold hands Shirou-kun.</p>



<p>For a while now, Tachibana-san has been trying to bring her hand close to mine, her trick was obvious, placing her hand in her coat pocket and tapping mine with the back of her hand from inside.</p>



<p>—We’re still close to the school.</p>



<p>—I don’t mind.</p>



<p>—You want me to put my hand inside your pocket? It’s too small.</p>



<p>—It’s to keep warm.</p>



<p>—And shouldn’t that be prioritized for girls?</p>



<p>—Shirou-kun, you’re not wearing a coat.</p>



<p>—Then I’ll do it myself when I have a coat.</p>



<p>—Unacceptable.</p>



<p>In her nonconformism, Tachibana-san raises an eyebrow and crashes her body against me helplessly. It’s clear that she didn’t like my answer at all, she’s becoming a lot more expressive than before.</p>



<p>—I want us to walk home holding hands.</p>



<p>—Wait, don’t be hasty. </p>



<p>—Your hands are cold.</p>



<p>—It’s all right. I have surprisingly good blood circulation.</p>



<p>—I hate it every time you try to rationalize your way out of things. </p>



<p>—But… What are we going to do about them? — <em>I asked as I looked back.</em></p>



<p>A group of first year girls walking behind us were watching us very intently, in turn having very loud conversations with each other, they kept pointing out the things we were doing or loudly expressing how cute Tachibana-san was.</p>



<p>Tachibana-san’s passionate kiss that she gave me on the festival stage after winning the couples’ contest had quite a strong repercussion, and even now, the mere fact that the two of us are walking together causes a lot of commotion and attracts everyone’s attention.</p>



<p>—It would be embarrassing for us to hold hands here.</p>



<p>—Don’t worry about that now.</p>



<p>—Easier said than done… Let’s go to the convenience store.</p>



<p>Her mood deteriorated further when she realized I had no intention of holding her hand. </p>



<p>I went into the store, and bought her favorite ice cream, Yukimi Daifuku, I hope this can lift her spirits. When we left the store, she started to walk away from me, I tried to give it to her, but she kept her hand in her pockets and refused to accept it.</p>



<p>Then, with an angry face, she opened her little mouth.</p>



<p>—No, that’s more embarrassing than walking hand in hand.</p>



<p>I looked back again, and the group of freshman girls had also stopped at the convenience store. They continued to watch us expectantly.</p>



<p>—The only thing you care about is what others think of you. — <em>Tachibana-san exclaimed as she turned around.</em></p>



<p>—I’m sorry…</p>



<p>—I wish you would be clearer with your feelings.</p>



<p>She is right, from her point of view, these kind of actions wouldn’t be pleasant for anyone. She knows what she wants, and what she wants with me, instead I keep making things complicated.</p>



<p>—It’s true, I should be more honest.</p>



<p>I pondered a bit at Tachibana-san’s words, after that, I made a decision. I grabbed the plastic stick, and pressed it against the Yukimi Daifuku, and then brought it towards Tachibana-san, </p>



<p>—Are you sure? — <em>Tachibana-san asked when she saw that I put the ice cream near her mouth.</em></p>



<p>—Yes, thanks to you, I realized that it’s absurd to limit myself just because of the fear that someone will see me or think something about what I do. Besides, I want you to be happy.</p>



<p>—In that case…</p>



<p>Tachibana-san proceeded to open her mouth, and her cheeks blushed a little. After that, I brought the ice cream even closer to her mouth, until she ate it with much joy.</p>



<p>Because of this loving situation, the group of girls who were following us shouted with much excitement. </p>



<p>—So, does it mean that we can walk hand in hand? — <em>Tachibana-san asked with a satisfied smile on her face.</em></p>



<p>I proceeded to put my hand in Tachibana-san’s pocket, and in turn, she was surprised that I did so. At this fact, she immediately took my hand, and gripped it very tightly.</p>



<p>—Shirou-kun, there’s something else that I want…</p>



<p>—And what’s that?</p>


<p>—This…</p>



<p>The next moment, Tachibana-san pulled my tie with her other hand, making our faces close in to each other, and then kissed me.</p>



<p>Her lips, which were icy cold from the winter air, pressed very hard on mine. Tachibana-san’s glassy eyes told me that this act was pure and natural.</p>



<p>Behind us, the group of girls who were still watching us, shouted with much excitement and expressed words of encouragement and happiness at our romantic scene.</p>



<p>When Tachibana-san stopped kissing me, she smiled and opened her lips slowly.</p>


<p>—Shirou-kun, let’s run. </p>



<p>A very unexpected and confusing request from her, I was obviously curious at such a sudden request.</p>



<p>—Huh? Why?</p>



<p>—Because that’s what I want now.</p>



<p>And without waiting for my answer, Tachibana-san took our hands out of her pocket, and started to run at her voice pulling my hand. I had no choice but to run too. And for some strange reason, the freshman girls who were behind us started to keep up with us. </p>



<p>A rather surreal situation that I’m not used to.</p>




<p>From that day on, Tachibana-san was no longer that reserved and expressionless girl everyone knew. Now she was the kind of girlfriend any high school boy would wish to have for themselves. </p>



<p>She would wait for me at the school gate when school started, and after school ended. During recess she comes to my classroom and sits next to me at the empty desk to keep me company. And during physical education, she puts on the jacket I wear to exercise.</p>



<p>—Everyone looks at me like I’m a fool.</p>



<p>—Like you’re my dumb girlfriend?</p>l


<p>—Yes. — <em>she replied energetically.</em></p>



<p>—They think I’m madly in love with Shirou-kun.</p>



<p>—Whose tie are you’re wearing, Tachibana-san?</p>



<p>—Yours.</p>



<p>—And that jacket of yours?</p>


<p>—Yours.</p>



<p>—And what are you thinking about now?</p>



<p>—Kissing you.</p>



<p>Tachibana-san takes the Yukimi Daifuku from my mouth with her finger, and eats it while smiling with satisfaction.</p>



<p>After we left the group of girls following us, we did a lot of things, we went into a photo booth, bought matching bracelets, visited a coffee shop, drank coffee with lots of cream which looked like a parfait, and even went to a second-hand bookstore…</p>



<p>And so, it went on for many days. Dates to Karaoke, where she surprisingly did very well. There were also escapes from her house during the night in order to see meteor showers together.</p>



<p>Tachibana-san had become the most romantic and cute girlfriend of all time. And in turn, making her also become a very popular figure among the girls at school.</p>



<p>Her cold and unattainable goddess personality was nowhere to be found. She is now a normal girl who is in love. Since that festival day, everyone has seen Tachibana-san in a different light. </p>



<p>Also, the teasing came quite soon after. The girls’ commonly known description for her was; “the girlfriend who is madly in love with her boyfriend”.</p>



<p>—[ don’t like it] — <em>Tachibana-san said over the phone.</em></p>



<p>It was night-time, and I was in bed talking to her. She had developed a need to want to fall asleep listening to my voice and breathing.</p>



<p>—[Everyone says I’m a possessive girlfriend. I’m not like that at all].</p>



<p>—[Sakai told me that it was difficult to talk to me now because Tachibana-san was making scary eyes].</p>



<p>—[….]</p>



<p>There was no response from her, but there was the sound of her body moving under the comforter. She must have been balled up.</p>



<p>—[…It’s Shirou-kun’s fault that I get jealous]</p>



<p>—[It’s my fault?]</p>



<p>—[Today I saw you talking happily with other girls].</p>



<p>Certainly, the girls in my class have been teasing me a lot.</p>



<p>—[That’s because they were looking forward to seeing Tachibana-san’s reaction.]</p>



<p>What happened today was not something that was caused by me. A group of girls had approached me because they could see from afar that Tachibana-san was on her way. After seeing me and the other girls together, Tachibana-san approached us in a violent manner claiming me as her property, they all shouted in joy and saying that it was something cute.</p>



<p>In the end, they left while telling her that those words were accurate, and patting her on the head.</p>



<p>—[Everyone was making fun of me.]</p>



<p>—[I don’t think so, they hold you in high esteem.]</p>



<p>Despite my answer, Tachibana-san still had her doubts.</p>



<p>—[Well, you can talk to them, but you have to promise me one thing.]</p>



<p>—[What?]</p>



<p>—[Don’t let other girls touch you, okay? When that happens… I feel a strong pain in my chest… And it makes me want to cry…].</p>



<p>The way Tachibana-san said it, it’s one of the sincerest things I’ve ever heard from her, and it makes me feel a pain in my chest too…</p>



<p>—[Okay, I’ll do it.]</p>



<p>—[Well, I’m going to sleep.]</p>



<p>—[Good night.]</p>



<p>—[Wait, don’t hang up… Let me do it tonight.]</p>



<p>Judging from Tachibana-san’s voice, her happy personality atmosphere vanished, and she had returned to being the same old Tachibana-san. </p>



<p>—[She’s there with you now… Right?]</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/m4wYcH0/sg-vol3-01.png" alt="sg-vol3-01" border="0"></a>



<p>Why was I talking to Tachibana-san while lying in the same bed with Hayasaka-san? Well… The reason for this event goes back to that afternoon after school.</p>



<p>—Today it’s my turn. Well, actually, today is Tachibana-san’s day, but she was busy with her piano lessons due to her piano competition coming up. So, I asked her to give up this day to me. I’m sorry that this was all very sudden, I made this decision on my own.</p>



<p>—I see. So, did you discuss all this with her afterwards?</p>



<p>—Yes, I did. What do you say, Kirishima-kun? Are you okay with it?</p>



<p>—Absolutely.</p>



<p>Those were the words I said that night at the train station when Tachibana-san and Hayasaka-san agreed to share me between the two of them.</p>



<p>From the outside it’s a perfect situation, right? But to be honest, I don’t know how the two of them must really feel about all this. Still, both girls set up four rules to be followed in the face of this strange relationship the three of us have.</p>



<p>Rule number one; Kirishima Shirou must obey whatever Hayasaka Akane and Tachibana Hikari say. </p>



<p>Rule number two; Hayasaka Akane and Tachibana Hikari must share Kirishima Shirou equally.</p>



<p>Rule number three; Hayasaka Akane and Tachibana Hikari must not do anything without the other knowing, no actions behind the other’s backs. </p>


<p>Rule number four; there will be a penalty if the set time with Kirishima Shirou is exceeded. </p>



<p>Since that night I have been boyfriends with these two girls on the days specified. But today there was this unexpected change of plans. </p>



<p>—What do you want us to do today? — <em>Hayasaka-san asked.</em></p>



<p>—Well, we should first decide which places to go. </p>



<p>Everyone at school recognizes me and Tachibana-san as official lovers, so, every time I do something with Hayasaka-san, I have to make sure no one sees us. That’s why our dates are always in places far away where students of this school don’t go near to. However, Hayasaka-san decided she wanted to take a chance today…</p>



<p>—Today at school is fine with me. I want to make the most of this day and I don’t want to waste time travelling long distances. I want to spend as much time with you as possible.</p>



<p>—Well, let’s say this will be the right place for a date, what do you want to do Hayasaka-san?</p>



<p>—Let’s have a little game.</p>



<p>—What kind of game?</p>



<p>—Walk around the building holding hands. </p>


<p>—No no no no, that’s a bad idea. Even if it’s after school, there are still a lot of students left.</p>



<p>—That’s true. If anyone sees us, I’ll be a bad girl who’s doing improper things with a boy who has a girlfriend. And lately Tachibana-san is very popular with girls, if you’re seen, you’re going to get hurt.</p>



<p>That’s not the only thing I’m worried about, I’ll be branded as an unfaithful man.</p>



<p>—And that’s why it will be a game — s<em>aid Hayasaka-san cheerfully with a childish expression.</em> — We’ll do our best to make sure no one finds us, we’ll be scouring the building constantly.</p>



<p>—But…</p>


<p>—Don’t worry, if we run into someone, I’ll take my hands off of you.</p>



<p>That could work as a security measure. While imagining that situation in my head, Hayasaka-san smiled mischievously.</p>



<p>—Hey… What do you say, Kirishima-kun? Are you okay with it?</p>



<p>—Absolutely</p>



<p>—Hehehehe. I like that about Kirishima-kun.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p>—Hey… What do you say, Kirishima-kun, are you okay with it?</p>



<p>—Absolutely</p>



<p>—Hehehehe. I like that about Kirishima-kun.</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san and I were walking through the school building holding hands. From the outside it looks like a very romantic and special scene. But now I don’t have the time to enjoy a moment like this.</p>



<p>Every time I hear the voices of the students participating in their club activities, I become uncomfortable and anxious, I feel that they might look out of the window at any moment and see me and Hayasaka-san like this together.</p>



<p>—Do you understand the rules, Kirishima-kun?</p>



<p>—Yeah, let’s get this over with quickly.</p>



<p>The rules set by Hayasaka-san were simple. Our school had built a new building next to the old one, with cross corridors connecting the buildings on the east and west sides. We decided to focus on only  one of the floors. </p>


<p>So we decided to start from the Mystery and Research club room, knock on the door of the classroom at the end of each of the buildings, and walk around until we return to the point of origin.</p>



<p>—It’s quiet, there are hardly any students in the old school building. </p>



<p>—Yeah, but to add to that you raised the difficulty level of this game with your second request.</p>



<p>—Hehehehe. — <em>she laughed sheepishly</em>.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san not only wanted us to walk hand in hand through the halls, she also wanted me to give her a kiss in the middle of every hallway.</p>


<p>—Come on, Kirishima-kun, I can’t wait to taste your….</p>



<p>Before Hayasaka-san could finish her words, we heard a noise of a door opening several meters ahead of us. A student had come out of the classroom. </p>



<p>—What… What are we going to do, Kirishima-kun?!</p>



<p>—Don’t worry, that guy usually wears his glasses to see clearly, but right now he’s not wearing them so he can’t see us that well.</p>



<p>The guy had set his gaze towards us, but there was no reaction from him. He just turned around and continued on his way.</p>


<p>—Hayasaka-san, it’s too risky for us to continue this.</p>



<p>—Why…? I… I just wanted to be Kirishima-kun’s girlfriend in high school, just for once…</p>



<p>My heart crumbled when I heard her say that. Hayasaka-san has been watching Tachibana-san and I being a normal couple in front of everyone in high school from afar. That must really hurt her deep down…</p>



<p>—Would you like us to go to the second floor too?</p>



<p>—Are you sure?! — <em>Hayasaka-san asked excitedly.</em></p>



<p>—Yes, everything will be fine.</p>



<p>—Yes! Thank you, Kirishima-kun! — <em>she said while pulling my hand.</em></p>



<p>I couldn’t let something like that happen again, so Hayasaka-san and I started to walk while holding hands and travel parallel to each other at a certain distance, this way, those watching us from the window, will be tricked by the optical illusion that we are just walking side by side.</p>



<p>In the event that we come face to face with someone, one of us will step forward, and put their hand behind their backs.</p>



<p>—I love this! You’re the best Kirishima-kun! — <em>she expressed with great joy.</em></p>


<p>—H—Hey! You’re so close! We’re just supposed to hold hands!</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san couldn’t control her excitement, and started hugging me tightly. My arm was held between her breasts, our thighs are close together, and our faces were placed very close to each other. In other words, it was quite a compromising situation for us, and especially dangerous if someone were to observe us like this.</p>



<p>—This is very dangerous, keep your distance.</p>



<p>—Come on, follow me to that corridor.</p>



<p>—You’re not listening to me…</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san dragged me to a certain point in the hallway, and we hid in a blind spot behind a column in the wall. Then she grabbed my shoulder, and our lips overlapped for a few seconds.</p>



<p>—Well, you got what you wanted, let’s go.</p>



<p>—No, I want more…</p>



<p>For her, it wasn’t enough that our lips were lightly pressed together. She was starting to feel hot, her cheeks flushed, and she became completely aroused. To prevent me from being able to escape, Hayasaka-san stood on her tiptoes, and placed her hands behind my neck, and kissed me again, but this time panting between each kiss, until she reached the point where her hot, wet tongue entered my mouth.</p>



<p>When she felt my tongue, Hayasaka-san takes it with her lips and starts sucking it hard. In turn, her breasts pressed into my chest, the softness of them making me lose my sanity.</p>


<p>—I like you… Kirishima-kun… I like you a lot….</p>



<p>After kissing for five minutes, Hayasaka-san parted her lips from mine, causing a trickle of our saliva to appear as the distance between us began to grow.</p>



<p>—I feel guilty that I enjoyed something extremely dangerous…</p>



<p>—Hehe.</p>



<p>A smirk appeared on Hayasaka-san’s face. After that dangerous kissing session, we turned around the second floor and headed towards the second-floor hallway that connects to the new school building.</p>


<p>—You know, Hayasaka-san, I heard about what you did today at break time. </p>



<p>—Oh, really?</p>



<p>At lunchtime, Hayasaka-san was in the back of the classroom with another group of girls, the topic of conversation was about what kind of boys each of them liked. The moment it was Hayasaka-san’s turn, she said out loud that she loved me.</p>



<p>When I heard this, I froze completely. Although everyone seemed unsurprised, or didn’t attach enough importance to her words, the reason was obvious, Tachibana-san had gone out of her way to make it clear that I belonged to her. And Hayasaka-san’s declaration of love was nothing more than a quick way to dodge such a question.</p>



<p>That’s how everyone tends to see Hayasaka-san, a girl who has no impure thoughts, and who wouldn’t dare to say out loud who the person she really loves is. Which ends up being funny, if everyone knew she was telling the truth, more than one guy would lose their mind. </p>


<p>—I think you should avoid playing with fire, Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>—It’s not fair… I… I just wish I could say out loud who’s the best I love…</p>



<p>—Hayasaka-san…</p>



<p>While we were talking about that, we reached the end of the hallway of the new school building. I tried to knock on the door of the last classroom. But before I could touch it, the door moved, causing every fiber of my body to be on high alert. </p>



<p>Suddenly, through the frosted glass, I could hear a person’s voice speak, and their silhouette appeared. </p>


<p>—Hayasaka-san, let me go, someone is coming. </p>



<p>—No…</p>



<p>—Huh? Why?!</p>



<p>—I don’t want to let go of Kirishima-kun’s hand.</p>



<p>Her answer was totally unexpected, she was determined in wanting to go all the way, she didn’t care at all about the consequences that could arise from here.</p>



<p>—This isn’t a good idea.</p>


<p>—I’m Kirishima-kun’s girlfriend too. I like you too. And I’m very serious.</p>



<p>—No, it’s my fault for letting all this happen, if I had chosen one of you two from the beginning, we wouldn’t have gotten to this situation where Tachibana-san and you have to share me, this is not good for you, so—…..</p>



<p>Before I could finish my words, the door opened unceremoniously. And the person who came out of the classroom was an adult woman I had never seen before. On the other hand, Hayasaka-san was puzzled and between hesitations said a word that surprised me a lot.</p>



<p>—Mo… Mom?</p>


<p>Come to think of it, today was our parents’ reunion day. Surely Hayasaka-san must have forgotten about it then, but it wasn’t the time to think about that right now.</p>



<p>—Akane, who is this boy? — <em>Hayasaka-san’s mother asked, looking at our clasped hands.</em></p>



<p>—Ah, mom, he, umm, he’s…. </p>



<p>Hayasaka-san didn’t know what to answer, her eyes were glazed over and her breathing was agitated.</p>



<p>—No, no, no, no… Boyfriend! Kirishima-kun, my boyfriend! We’re dating!</p>


<p>There was no turning back now, I had no choice but to play along with Hayasaka-san’s game.</p>



<p>—Hello, my name is Kirishima Shirou, it’s a pleasure to meet you.</p>



<p>From then on, everything happened very quickly. I met the Mother of Hayasaka-san, went to her home, we had dinner together, and spent a long time talking about various things. Before we knew it, time flew by and it was already too late in the evening, so I was invited to spend the night at their home.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san’s mother lent a T-shirt of her husband’s, he is on a business trip right now, so it will just be the three of us. Hayasaka-san will sleep in her room, mother in hers, and I will sleep in the room of her older sister, who has left home after finding herself a job.</p>



<p>I was lying in bed thinking about the things that happened today, but my thoughts were interrupted when I saw Hayasaka-san enter the room and lie down next to me on the bed. </p>


<p>And if things couldn’t get any worse, a call came in on my phone, that person was Tachibana-san, thus, creating a rather awkward situation where I was lying with Hayasaka-san, and at the same time talking on the phone with Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>—Thank you for agreeing to this, Tachibana-san. — <em>said Hayasaka-san while hugging me under the comforter and with her face pressed into my chest.</em> — I think my mother is happy that I have a boyfriend.</p>



<p>—But is that okay with you?</p>



<p>I’m a little worried that Hayasaka-san will get her hopes up too high about this, and the reason is more than obvious.</p>



<p>—Your mom might find out about me and Tachibana-san through her friends.</p>


<p>—It’s okay, I just have to say that Kirishima-kun broke up with Tachibana-san…</p>



<p>Saying that, Hayasaka-san poked her head out of the comforter and addressed Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>—[Hey, Tachibana-san, you don’t have a problem with it?]</p>



<p>—[No, go ahead.] </p>



<p>Tachibana-san answers through the phone. The two girls start exchanging information with each other, planning what the next few days will be with whom I will be with.</p>


<p>—[I don’t want to keep interrupting, so I’m hanging up.]</p>



<p>However, before Tachibana-san did so, she hesitated a little, and turned to Hayasaka-san again.</p>



<p>—[…Umm, Hayasaka-san.]</p>



<p>—[Take it easy… I won’t break any of our rules, I’ll do everything as agreed.]</p>



<p>—[…Then, good night.]</p>


<p>Tachibana-san’s voice stops coming out through the phone speaker. And the next thing that happened is that Hayasaka-san reached back under the comforter, and unzipped the zipper of my T-shirt trying to take it off.</p>



<p>—Wait wait, Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>—What’s wrong?</p>



<p>—I just talked to Tachibana-san.</p>



<p>—So what? We can still do things those normal lovers do, you don’t have to be self-conscious, Tachibana-san allows it. — <em>She said while placing her lips on my chest.</em> — Okay, let’s do it, we won’t do anything that we’ll regret later.</p>


<p>—I don’t think it’s a good idea… Your mother is in the other room.</p>



<p>—It’s okay, once she goes to sleep, she doesn’t wake up until the next day.</p>



<p>—Still… I don’t think it’s right for us to do this kind of thing in your sister’s room.</p>



<p>—I’ve had enough of this… — <em>she said as her eyes turned dark.</em></p>



<p>—I’m sorry.</p>



<p>—I don’t want you to apologize. I don’t mean to blame you for anything. — <em>Feelings of sadness on Hayasaka-san’s part began to seep through as she unbuttoned her pajamas.</em> — You didn’t want to do it with me at that time because Tachibana-san was hiding in the closet, right?</p>



<p>—Yes.</p>



<p>—It’s not because I’m an unattractive girl, right? It’s not because Kirishima-kun doesn’t like me at all, right?</p>



<p>—Of course not.</p>



<p>—Then prove it, or I don’t know what will happen next. I can’t believe your words anymore. A few days ago, I started to wear the shorter skirt, do you know why?</p>


<p>—I think I do.</p>



<p>—I attracted the attention of all the boys at school. They gave me nasty looks, and it made me feel bad. But it was the only way to know if Kirishima-kun was attracted to me or not.</p>



<p>—I am attracted to you, very much Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>—Demonstrate it to me. Touch me, make me yours, let me know that you’re crazy about me, and that I’m not useless… What do you say, Kirishima-kun? Are you okay with it?</p>



<p>—…Absolutely.</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san keeps reminding me of the words I said that night at the train station… I had no choice but to accept her request, so I put my hand on her chest, as a result, a small, tender moan came out of her mouth, at the same time she started to breathe sweetly.</p>



<p>I felt the presence of a bulge through the upper portion of her pajamas. Well, to be more precise, I felt it from the moment she laid down next to me after she entered the room. </p>



<p>When I caress that small hard area with my fingers, Hayasaka-san’s vacant eyes start to moisten, and her expression becomes more ecstatic.</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun….</p>



<p>Feelings of pleasure and spite invaded her body, I kissed her full lips and sounds of saliva deliberately emerged after each kiss. Maybe it’s the sound, or the fact that Hayasaka-san’s body temperature is rising higher and higher, but her sweaty body made me excited.</p>


<p>I continued to touch her large breasts on the soft pajama fabric, which, even with my hand open all the way, was still not enough to be able to cover the whole area. With every movement I made, the shape of it moved in an interesting way. </p>



<p>Every action has its reaction, and the reaction of Hayasaka-san’s body was also quite interesting. The bulge stands out clearly on the fabric, and sweat begins to show through her skin. </p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun…. I like it, Kirishima-kun….</p>



<p>As the act became more intense, we started to undress each other, until we were down to our underwear.</p>



<p>—I like this. I can feel Kirishima-kun’s body heat.</p>


<p>—Hayasaka-san’s body is very warm.</p>



<p>It was very special for us to be cuddling in bed on a cold winter night, with our skin touching each other. I could really feel that I was not alone, and Hayasaka-san’s expression was also happier than ever.</p>



<p>I touched Hayasaka-san’s warm skin with my fingertips very slowly, being turned on by her shoulders, her back, her waist, and the fact that she was only wearing one piece of underwear. With my leg between her thighs, we try to be closer to each other.</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun, your-…</p>



<p>—I’m sorry…</p>


<p>—No, it’s okay, it’s normal for that to happen to boys, right? It means Kirishima-kun is very attracted to me, that’s what happens, right?</p>



<p>—Yes…</p>



<p>—I’m so happy! — <em>she expressed while clinging to me and kissing my neck.</em> — Kirishima-kun can do whatever he wants with me. My body is all yours, you are free to touch and kiss every part of me.</p>



<p>I climbed on top of Hayasaka-san, and continued to touch her breasts. Hayasaka-san began to gasp, I ran my tongue over her soft skin, which caused her to press her crotch against mine. the result? A rather lovely sound from her.</p>



<p>—Hayasaka-san, your voice.</p>


<p>—Umm…</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san took my left hand, and put my index finger into her mouth, then started to lick it as if it was a pacifier. For my part, I continued to stimulate the tip of her breasts, she squirms and continues to suck my finger, only with much more force than before.</p>



<p>Every time I touch a sensitive area of hers, her body gets even hotter. Hayasaka-san is at my mercy with an ecstatic expression. I touched her crotch with my free hand, it was a very warm and moist place that can be felt even through her underwear. </p>



<p>—It’s okay, I don’t mind Kirishima-kun treating me like a toy.</p>



<p>I then slipped my hand inside her underwear, it was such a wet place that by just placing my fingers at the entrance of the hole, it slid smoothly by itself without any effort from me. As soon as the repetitive movements I was making with my finger were generated, a sound like water started to be heard from in there. </p>


<p>—Don’t… Don’t do that… I’m… I’m embarrassed… Aaah….</p>



<p>Despite her plea, Hayasaka-san continued to suck my finger hard, her breathing was agitated, but sweet at the same time. </p>



<p>Her hips moved slightly, the force of movement of my finger became even stronger, and the sound generated by her crotch was also more intense. The intervals between spasms were getting shorter and shorter, it was as if she was entering a state of pleasure that was already reaching its climax.</p>



<p>The image of Hayasaka-san in front of me was so erotic and turned me on so much, that I put my body between Hayasaka-san’s legs, I pulled my fingers out of her most sensitive parts.</p>



<p>The next thing I did was to press my crotch with hers, and as if our minds were connected, we both rubbed our parts very intensely.</p>


<p>—We can’t take the next step Kirishima-kun, I promised Tachibana-san…</p>



<p>—I know.</p>



<p>—But still… I want to do this… I want to give everything to Kirishima-kun.</p>



<p>—Me too… I want to do this with you, Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>For us, the promise we made to Tachibana-san was bigger than our desires, so we just rubbed and kissed each other. </p>


<p>—Your tongue… Give it to me…. </p>



<p>I thrust my tongue into Hayasaka-san’s mouth.</p>



<p>—More, more, more, more aaahhh…..</p>



<p>After that, Hayasaka-san hugged me tightly and presses her mouth on me, as if trying to bite me…</p>



<p>—Kirishima-kun… That was amazing… I love Kirishima-kun, Kirishima-kun!</p>


<p>Hayasaka-san continued to rub her crotch against mine rhythmically and repeatedly. The kissing continued and we stayed that way all night. By the time our level of perversion was over, it was already morning.</p>



<p>—I want to change my underwear.</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san looked embarrassed, and hid her expression with her bangs.</p>



<p>—And, I’d better wash the sheets too before my mom wakes up.</p>



<p>After she left the room, I picked up my phone that was on the bedside table… And I had gotten a creepy surprise when I saw the screen…</p>


<p>—[So… You didn’t hang up.]</p>



<p>—[…Good morning, Shirou-kun. I don’t know anything about it, I just know that I fell asleep with my phone on.]</p>



<p>Tachibana-san replied in a serious voice. I’m sure there’s a lot you’d like to talk to me about, but I’ve been awake all night, and I can’t think clearly. But I’ll take this moment to ask you a question I’ve been meaning to ask you for a while.</p>



<p>—[Don’t you regret it?]</p>



<p>—[What?]</p>



<p>—[Don’t you regret accepting Hayasaka-san’s proposal?]</p>



<p>—[I couldn’t let Shirou-kun make a decision at that moment.]</p>



<p>—[Why not?]</p>



<p>—[Because you definitely would have chosen Hayasaka-san, because you’re someone kind… No, the truth is… Shirou-kun is weak.]</p>
