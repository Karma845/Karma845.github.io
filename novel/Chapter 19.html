<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Brother's Willpower</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" class="calibre19">When
a group of novice adventurers fought against an elf of level 1500 that
possessed the fantasy class Grandius, it is obvious who would win.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
less than a few minutes, Miya's comrades, who had drawn their swords to protect
her, fell to the ground with deep cuts to their bodies.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hii,
hii, hiii......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
crying in despair, Miya continued to hold her staff.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
elf slashed his brother and friends. He isn't hurt at all, and he rechecked his
status.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tsk...
As expected, small fry like them can't raise my level. Well, it's okay. At
least it will increase my experience point. Besides..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hiii!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
slowly turns back to Miya.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
elf with a beautiful face, pointed ears, and green eyes talks to himself.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"She's
ugly, but I've been stuck in this dungeon for days. Sometimes humans still can
be useful. I can use her as entertainment."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
no, stay away..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Miya
retreats while holding her staff.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
tilted his head.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't understand."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
am a future hero, and I am going to use you. Above all, the most honorable
thing a human woman can hope for is to be embraced by an elf man, right?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So
why are you so frightened and running away? Instead, you should shed happy tears,
right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Aside
from the "future hero" mentioned by Kaito, "the most honorable
thing a human woman can hope for is to be embraced by an elf man" is a
typical misconceptions and racism believed by the elves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">No
matter how good they look, no human woman would willingly go along with someone
who clearly thinks she is a fool.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Despite
this, elf men mistakenly believe that if they call out to a human woman, she
will immediately fall in love with them and beg to be embraced.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
how confident the elf men are in their own beauty.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Mi,
ya, run, ru..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Onii-chan!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
Kaito turns his head, Miya's brother, the red-haired Erio, stands up behind
him, using his sword as a walking stick.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
had been deeply wounded in the stomach during his fight with Kaito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Blood
is flowing from the wound in his stomach, creating a blood pool on the floor.
The injury was so severe that ordinary people won't be able to move.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
thanks to his intensive training in the dungeon and his level up, he had
acquired endurance, physical and mental strength that could not be compared
with ordinary people.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Thanks
to this, he was able to stand up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
he won't have been able to stand if his body had been slashed and his legs had
been cut off like Gimra and Wardy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Cough,
cough ough!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Erio
coughed and spat out a clot of blood.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
knew instinctively that he would not survive.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is a miracle that he can stand up again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
enemy in front of him is far more superior. The only thing he can do with his
remaining breath is to protect his sister until the end.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
raised his sword and shield and shouts.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Miya,
run! Cough..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Onii-chan..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Sensing
the death approaching her brother Erio, Miya holds her tears and runs away.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tsk,
I'm not sure why you're trying to run away. You're just a bug, don't give me
any trouble!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
clicked his tongue as he watched Miya running away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
had no intention of letting her alive since she had seen him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is sure that she won't be able to reach the dungeon entrance. But it would be
troublesome if she met other adventurers on the way and told them about his
race, characteristics, weapons, and so on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
immediately tried to chase after him, but Erio, who is already on the verge of
death, swings his sword.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"You're
a dead man!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Don't get in my way!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He doesn't
need to use his treasure sword, Grandius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
difference in their level is too significant. Erio's sword can't even scratch
his skin, but it was enough to stop him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tsk......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
could just leave the dying man to chase after Miya. Still, it would be
troublesome if another adventurer happened to pass by while he is dying and
tells them about Kaito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
best thing to do would be to quickly kill Erio and chase after his sister.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
grabbed the grandius sword with both hands. He wants to cut off his opponent's
head as fast as possible, but something weird happens to Erio.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is bleeding badly and almost lost consciousness, but he kept muttering
something repeatedly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"There's
no rule that says you must use your shield for defense and your sword for attack.
The shield's role is not only to protect. The sword's role is not only to
attack. You have to use your head and think about what your enemy scared of and
what you can do to catch them off guard."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"What,
what the hell is wrong with this guy?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is wandering why his opponent, who almost unconscious still standing and
repeatedly muttering something. Erio is repeating "Gold's teaching".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">……
And that gave him a chance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Erio
throws the sword in his hand!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
also didn't expect him to throw a sword. Because he was wandering about Erio's
weird behavior, so he's a bit late to respond.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
did not use his sword or his arms to block the attack. He reflexively moved his
body to avoid it because of the training he had acquired during his time as a
knight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">At
the same time, Erio strikes Kaito in the face with the shield in his hand!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ugh!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
was hit in the face with a very basic shield blow.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
damage is zero, but because he took it as he was trying to avoid the sword, he
ended up falling on his butt.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">An
elf with level 1,500 was knocked off his feet by a human boy with level no more
than level 20.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pQXMVXG/000024.jpg" height="500" width="330"></img>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
was an outstanding achievement.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">What
Kaito saw is not an illusion. The boy looking down at him and grinned.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
got you!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">～～～～～～～～～～～</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Don't,
don't get cocky, human!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is so angry. As if to cover up his mistake and his shame, he jumps and swings
his grandius sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
stabbed his sword deep into Erio, who was already losing a lot of blood and
pinned him to the ground. Then Kaito kicked him in a desperate attempt to
inflict pain and torture him while still conscious.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Don't
think you can die easily!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">You
damn human!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6"></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">You'll regret in pain for wounding my
beautiful face!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Furious
at the unexpected counterattack, Kaito continued to torture and yells at Erio.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
took a few minutes for Kaito to remember the fact that he had allowed Miya to
escape. </span></p>
