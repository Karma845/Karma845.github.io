<h2 style= "text-align:center;">Bank Statement</h2>

<p>First of all, I didn't connect any bank account in this account. So my main bank state will be my gcash account (which I have history in my activity.) and the link shortener I've used to create money.</p>

<p>This is my past activity in my Gcash account. "Cash-in via PayPal" is my history cashing in with my PayPal account. </p>

<p>Now, this is the latest cash-in I've used in this account.</p>

<p>Another bank statement I can provide is my history with my link shortener.</p>

<p>The latest 65$ payout was sended in my  current account and the amout was deducted mostly because of the tax service of the websites.</p>

<p>Now, this photo is the proof that my Linkvertise account was connected to my PayPal account.</p>

<p>I hope this is enough to conclude the bank statement. Since I didn't connect any bank account, and I've also read in the community of PayPal that as long as I explained what happened it would at least help me to conclude this limit. I hope you'll understand this situation.
