<h2 style= "text-align:center;">Explanation on how business works</h2>

<p>My website animestuff.me, is novel site providing epub/pdf were I provide myself by using the Fan TL or MTL in novel updates.</p>

<p>Now, in order to download my files, the users must need to tackle link shortener I provided and that would be Linkvertise. After the ad they can freely download my file, whether epub or pdf. The picture below is the proof on how many times I already cash out in that website. The latest 65$ was mention in my current account.<p>

<p>Now, this photo is the proof that my Linkvertise account was connected to my PayPal account.</p>

<p>Another explanation on how I run my website would be by asking donations or asking them to subscribe to my membership.</p>

<p>The first photo was Donation while the second one is Membership. Since I don't usually get donation nor membership most of my money is coming from link shorteners. I hope this would help to conclude the limitations in my account. Thank you for the service.</p>
