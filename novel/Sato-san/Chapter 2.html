		<h2>Chapter 2 &#8211; Second first love</h2>




<p>I, Oshio-souta, am an employee at Cafe Tutujiーーalthough I don&#8217;t get paid, I&#8217;m a high school student before that.</p>



<p>On weekends, I work at the cafe, but of course, I have to go to school after the break.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;. For example, Even if my physical condition is very bad due to lack of sleep the day before.</p>



<p>And then even if I end up dozing while being tossed by the hustle and bustle of a lunch break alone in the classroom.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s like akabeko]</p>



<p>In my slumber, I was suddenly awakened by the sound of my best friend Misono Ren laughing like an idiot.</p>



<p>Apparently i had fallen asleep before he knew it.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;ah.Ren,what about the next lesson&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>[Oi! Stop being sleepy head.it&#8217;s already lunch break]</p>



<p>He took a position on the other side of the desk and took a bite of the croquette bread he had bought from the store.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;.It seems that the last several dozen minutes are vague.I seem to be dozing for quite some time.</p>



<p>But my sleepiness hasn&#8217;t cleared up at all, my head is still foggy as if in a haze.</p>



<p>[Are you still asleep?]</p>



<p>[No,a little more&#8230;.I&#8217;m really tired]</p>



<p>[Wake up,wake up.why did I have to eat while looking at the man&#8217;s sleeping face]</p>



<p>When I was about to take a nap, I was shaken roughly by the shoulder and woke up forcibly.</p>



<p>I know it&#8217;s unreasonable of me to ask him to wake me up, but I&#8217;m a little annoyed.</p>



<p>[Give me a break.I am sleep deprived]</p>



<p>[Lack of sleep? Did something happen to you that made you stay up late?]</p>



<p>I was so excited to be able to talk to the girl I like for the first time in a long time that I couldn&#8217;t sleep until dawn.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible to say even if my mouth get teared up.</p>



<p>Especially to the guy in front of me who looks like a clown walking around with his clothes on.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s nothing.i was just watching itube till late night]</p>



<p>[Ha-ha-ha! You&#8217;re such an idiot! Hahahahaha]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a stupid laugh.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to be told that only by you.</p>



<p>Or rather,you always send me strange itube video link in mine at late in night,do you think you have the right to say that to me?</p>



<p>While thinking that inwardly,I glared at that guy who is laughing like an idiot at myself.</p>



<p>[Hey souta, should I tell you something to wake you up?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.if it&#8217;s about how to be a youtuber then no.]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s different]</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t need to know about TV drama story or gravure models too.]</p>



<p>[To wake up more then that]</p>



<p>[What is it?]</p>



<p>[Look at the opposite side]</p>



<p>I looked sideways while furrowing my eyebrows.</p>



<p>Then just like he said,my drowsiness was gone in an instant.</p>



<p>Because Sato-san was standing by the window, directly opposite to us who were sitting in the hallway, and she was staring here with tremendous eyes.</p>



<p>Her gaze was so laser-like that even a flying fly might drop it.</p>



<p>[Ah!?]</p>



<p>I turned around my face,my heart almost stopped.</p>



<p>Perhaps Seeing me surprised to that extent was interesting,Ren twisted his mouth like a demon.</p>



<p>[Did you get awake?]</p>



<p>I turned to face Ren and said in a murderous way,</p>



<p>[Since when,since when Sato-san was doing that?]</p>



<p>[Probably from around 10 minute.she hasn&#8217;t moved even a 1mm.]</p>



<p>[10..!?]</p>



<p>Did I take a nap for 10 minutes while being struck by the murderous gaze?</p>



<p>And Sato-san,why are you like that Sato-san.</p>



<p>[Souta!,did you do something to make Sato-san dislike you.]</p>



<p>Ren said while showing a broad grin</p>



<p>At that moment, I felt the blood drain from my body.</p>



<p>[Eh?why?]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t know but you are definitely going to be killed, to anger&nbsp; &#8220;salt god Sato san&#8221; that much, just what have you done?]</p>



<p>[Lie]</p>



<p>Inside of my head turned pure white.</p>



<p>If I had to describe my current state of mind in one word, It feels like it&#8217;s the end of the world.</p>



<p>[Sato san has been acting like that continuously, everyone is freaking out wondering when it gonna happen]</p>



<p>&nbsp;I could hear Ren&#8217;s voice in the distance, completely lost in thought.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I wonder if yesterday&#8217;s thing was offensive .</p>



<p>That might be so, taking the girl who doesn&#8217;t talk much to the room and going as far as touching hand.I can&#8217;t blame her for thinking I&#8217;m an animal&#8230;.</p>



<p>[Hey souta! somehow Sato-san is coming this way ah&#8230;&#8230;wai&#8230;..!]</p>



<p>Is this what heaven to hell is all about?</p>



<p>I can talk to the girl I like, I feel like an idiot for being so excited last night. &#8230;..</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.uta!&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.souta&#8230;&#8230;.hey&#8230;&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>&#8212;-Ah,I want to vanish,I want to disappear.</p>



<p>Certainly now that I think about it again, I was creepy yesterday.</p>



<p>Die, should I die?, there is no other way then to die&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[Souta-kun!!]</p>



<p>As I was sinking into despair, her voice echoed throughout the classroom.</p>



<p>As I raised my face and returned to myself,before I knew it, Sato-san was standing right beside me, looking down at me.</p>



<p>Deadly silent,In the center of the quiet classroom, Sato-san is looking down at me as if she can&#8217;t see anything else beside me.</p>



<p>With her thin shoulders shaking and her face flushed like an apple, she &#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Ma,&#8230;.Ma&#8230;..,Mine!&#8230;can we share Mine id?]</p>



<p>She said this while chewing very hard.</p>



<p>[Eh?]</p>



<p>That line caught me completely off guard.</p>



<p>everyone in the class was surprised to hear this remark with their eyes rounded, but the one who was most surprised was me,so much so that I stopped thinking.</p>



<p>To this response, Sato-san said [different&#8230;.it&#8217;s different!] And started giving explanations while gesturing with her hands and feet.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not like I want to know Oshio-kun Mine!&#8230;..No!.. that was rude.I am sorry.I really want to know your MINE&#8230;.. it&#8217;s not that!]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;. Sato-san?]</p>



<p>[That, look! I thought I should send you that picture! Yes, that&#8217;s right, that picture&#8230; You remember it, right?&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;]</p>



<p>[Sato-san&#8212;&#8212;]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on, but calm down..</p>



<p>I was thinking about saying that, but Sato-san, who looked like a locomotive spewing steam out of his face, showed no sign of stopping.</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;That selfie we took last night in Oshio-kun house!]</p>



<p>I felt the air in the classroom froze.</p>



<p>This state of emergency, Sato-san hasn&#8217;t released yet.</p>



<p>Rather, she seemed to be saying, &#8220;I finally got to say it.&#8221; While patting her chest in relief.</p>



<p>I looked at Ren as if to ask for help.</p>



<p>Ren just stared at me and opened his mouth to say only one thing,</p>



<p>[Amazing]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t like it when my best friend is stupid and unpredictable.</p>



<p>With Sato-san remarks as a trigger, the classmates&#8217; piercing gaze concentrates all at once.</p>



<p>Disregarding my almost tearful face,more and more classmates started to join and start a commotion.</p>



<p>[By MINE, does Sato-san also using MINE?how should I&nbsp;</p>



<p>His say&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s surprising?why with Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t you think those two look close?I have never seen Sato san talking to anyone before but&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[She also said about selfie and house&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Perhaps those two are going out?]</p>



<p>Sato-san seemed to be busy blowing out steam and didn&#8217;t seem to hear these voices, but I heard them all the same.Ahhhhh,that moment my face turned red like in fever…</p>



<p>[Sa&#8230; Sato-san,you aren&#8217;t feeling thirsty?]</p>



<p>I stood up from my chair and strained my voice deliberately.</p>



<p>But on the other hand, Sato-san tilted her head in a cute little animal-like gesture&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Oh,not particularly.I am not feeling thirsty.Ra&#8230;Rather then that, about MINE&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>[Okay, but I&#8217;m thirsty! Let&#8217;s go get some juice, juice!]</p>



<p>[Mine&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Shall we go now?]</p>



<p>I ran away from the classroom by forcibly pulling Mr. Sato, who didn&#8217;t understand my intentions so much that I was surprised.</p>



<p>Everyone gazes stabbing my back hurts but there wasn&#8217;t much I could do.</p>



<p>I continued down the hallway, turned the corner in front of the central staircase, and went straight down the long corridor that led to the other building.</p>



<p>I let out a deep sigh when I saw that there was no sign of anyone.</p>



<p>[Haaaaah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>My heart is still pounding.</p>



<p>I was so embarrassed that I almost died.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What excuse will I give to Ren later?</p>



<p>When I was thinking about it.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>A voice came from behind me, sounding as if it was about to disappear.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>Without giving any second thought,I turn around to look and,</p>



<p>[Uwaa!?]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a scream.</p>



<p>For the reason is Sato-san shaking and trembling with a record-breaking unprecedented &#8220;redness&#8221;.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s wrong? Are you just now realizing what you&#8217;ve done?</p>



<p>I thought this at first but apparently I was wrong.</p>



<p>She pointed to her other hand with the fingers of one hand, and then said,</p>



<p>[That,hand&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Hand&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>When I looked downward,I finally realised.</p>



<p>My right hand was holding her bright red left hand in a tight grip&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[!? Ah, I&#8230;I am sorry!]</p>



<p>I took my hand away as quickly as I could.</p>



<p>Sato san with a face like having a fever looked at the palm of her hand.</p>



<p>Ugh&#8230;&#8230;..even though I was crazy about running but as expected suddenly grabbing the hand must have been creepy, right&#8230;..!? dammit&#8230;&#8230;my hands didn&#8217;t sweat right?</p>



<p>When I was struggling with this, I noticed that</p>



<p>[Uuuu&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>What in the world is going on here?</p>



<p>The face of Sato-san, which was flushed so much, turned pale in an instant, and this time she looked down with a face that seemed to start crying.</p>



<p>The change was so sudden that I could not help but feel confused.</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;wait Sato-san, what&#8217;s the matter&#8230;?]</p>



<p>[U,uuu&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Even if I ask, She just groaned like a cat while holding her tears down.</p>



<p>Was holding hand forcibly so unpleasant to the extent that she started crying?</p>



<p>In the empty corridor, as I waited for her to speak, Sato-san&#8217;s voice trembled.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;. Sorry, Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;.as expected, suddenly asking for exchange mine was a bad idea&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Ah, that one.</p>



<p>[No!, It&#8217;s not like I didn&#8217;t want to.]</p>



<p>I managed to appeal to Sato-san, who was looking up at me with her upturned eyes, with a gesture to say, [I don&#8217;t think that way at all.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.But Oshio-kun, when I asked you to exchange Mine, hadn&#8217;t you denied in an indirect way?&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I see,so that&#8217;s the catch huh&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[No, that was just because I was embarrassed to exchange them in front of everyone&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..But didn&#8217;t people exchange mines in the classroom&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>[Ugh&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I once again groaned.</p>



<p>Sato-san, you seem to have a slight airheadedness or communicative disorder. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Well, anyway!</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not bad, but rather I&#8217;m happy.]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m honestly happy that Sato-san suggested exchanging contact information with me, and that&#8217;s my honest and true opinion.</p>



<p>Of course I&#8217;m happy, I&#8217;m so happy that I&#8217;m in heaven.</p>



<p>[Really&#8230;&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>Sato-san asks me with an anxious expression, like a child soaked in the rain.</p>



<p>No Matter how many times she asked,the answer was same.</p>



<p>[Really.lets share.]</p>



<p>I take out my phone from my pocket.</p>



<p>Hereupon,her smile blossomed like a flower blooming in the spring.</p>



<p>She shook her head innocently, like a child.</p>



<p>Being hit by an innocent smile creates an extra misunderstanding in me.</p>



<p>Ahh, I&#8217;m like a child.</p>



<p>Sato san told me earlier it&#8217;s for sharing pictures we took yesterday.</p>



<p>All the high school girls of today exchange it normally, and Sato-san wanted a friend.I was just happy to be selected as one.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t misunderstand..</p>



<p>She just smile a little and said to exchange Mine, don&#8217;t get misunderstanding like&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>Perhaps Sato-san like me?</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. This is my id, can I get it registered?]</p>



<p>[All right]</p>



<p>Whether she knew what I was thinking or not, Sato-san sniffed and began to operate her own phone while staring intently at the screen of the phone I held out to her.</p>



<p>I felt my heart tighten as I stared at her, but I managed to keep a smile on my face so that she wouldn&#8217;t notice.</p>



<p>She who is known as &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221; is finally trying to change on her own accord.</p>



<p>She is making an effort to break out of her thick shell and make friends.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m just a stepping stone, a &#8220;first friend,&#8221; nothing more, nothing less.</p>



<p>If I reveal my feelings for her here&#8212;&#8211; she&#8217;ll be very annoyed.For that reason&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Bokon.</p>



<p>My phone buzzed with a dumb voice, informing me of Sato-san&#8217;s friend request.</p>



<p>[I did it]</p>



<p>Sato-san reports it to me, looking very happy.</p>



<p>I smiled at her as a friend.</p>



<p>it might not be possible right now.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t touch her beautiful hair, put my hand on her slender body, or gaze at her sunflower-like smile as long as I want.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;m sorry, I haven&#8217;t given up on you one bit.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not going to give up on my first love, which comes only once in a life, just because of this, don&#8217;t look down on highschool students.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to make you aware of it, I&#8217;m going to have you look back.</p>



<p>So now, first of all, start from friends.</p>



<p>[Finally done, Sato-san.]</p>



<p>With that said, I added her to &#8220;friends &#8221; list in Mine.</p>



<p>Not long after that, there was a silly sound, and my phone received a message from mine which reads,</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve received a new message from Koharu Sato.&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>I wondered, and opened the Mine app.</p>



<p>There was a cute Pomeranian icon on the screen, probably from owner Sato-San.</p>



<p>There was a speech balloon extension that read.</p>



<p>[Will you go together with me to drink tapioca milk tea after school?]</p>



<p>As I finished reading the message, I received another stamp with a deformed Pomeranian covering his face with his front paw.</p>



<p>Sato-san also, like the Pomeranian in the stamp, is hiding her bright red face with his phone.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I wonder how long I can continue to be a mere &#8220;friend&#8221; in front of such a cute creature.</p>

<p>After that, we went back to the classroom, and I dare not tell you how much attention we got from everyone.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I mean, I don&#8217;t want to remember.</p>



<p>it would only make me want to die of shame and no one would benefit from it.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;ll tell you this.</p>



<p>When I returned to my seat, Ren Misono, who seemed to have just finished eating his croquette bread, tapped me on the shoulder and said,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[You&#8217;re doing great.]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all he said, and went back to his seat instead.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s stupid, he&#8217;s witless, but he&#8217;s definitely my best friend.</p>



<p>And so the boring class was over, and it was time for the long-awaited after-school activity.</p>



<p>Sato-san and I, under a barrage of stares, hurried out of the classroom.And then we arrived there.</p>



<p>[As usual,it&#8217;s terribly long line]</p>



<p>I let out my voice in admiration when I saw the long line stretching to the sidewalk like a snake, not just inside the store.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always looked at it from a distance, but I never thought there will come a day where I will be part of it&#8230;&#8230;you never know.</p>



<p>The name of the store is &#8220;Tea bar&#8221;.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the only tapioca milk tea store in town, and people line up every day.</p>



<p>[Hey, Oshio-kun, it&#8217;s Tapioca milk tea! The one they&#8217;re talking about! It looks really good!]</p>



<p>[Clam down Sato-san.]</p>



<p>She seemed to be completely excited in front of the line, her eyes glittering, and she was sniffling incessantly.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..It&#8217;s like a child being brought into a toy store.</p>



<p>[But the line is pretty long, are you okay?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m fine! I can&#8217;t go home after coming this far.]</p>



<p>Without changing,Sato-san continued to sniffle like a kettle or something.</p>



<p>But halfway through, She stopped moving as if she had noticed something.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;m sorry, Oshio-kun kun.Its my bad to keep you with me to company in line]</p>



<p>Sato-san said so while blatantly downhearted.</p>



<p>She is upright in a strange place.</p>



<p>I let out a sigh, turn around on my heels,</p>



<p>[Let&#8217;s get in line quickly, I&#8217;m thirsty.]</p>



<p>And walked to the end of the line.</p>



<p>Sato-san rolled her eyes once in surprise, then hurried to follow behind me.</p>



<p>[Oh, Oshio-kun, there&#8217;s a splendid long line.]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s what I said earlier.it&#8217;s alright,since we have come,we will not go before trying it.]</p>



<p>[But..]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;d like to try it too, the much talked about tapioca milk tea!</p>



<p>Besides, it&#8217;s for Sato-san.]</p>



<p>The two footsteps that had been overlapping with a flapping sound suddenly became one.Thinking it was a little strange,I turned around my back only to see Sato-san with a puzzled expression.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.?What&#8217;s wrong?]</p>



<p>[Because&#8230;&#8230;just now, Oshio-kun kun said it&#8217;s for me&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[I said that,so?]</p>




<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>





<p>[Yeah, because that means]</p>



<p>Her voice trembled, and cheeks flushed</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what she meant by that response, but I answered.</p>



<p>[Yes, I know that&#8217;s what you need to do to become a minstagrammer, Sato-san.Of course I&#8217;ll cooperate.]</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>[What? Didn&#8217;t you want the tapioca milk tea for Minsta, Sato-san?]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;What?&#8221; Sato-san tilted her head like a squirrel.</p>



<p>[I mean,you want to use the photo of the currently famous tapioca milk tea to launch your Minsta account,it&#8217;s that Kind of strategy, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>[Ahh&#8230;]</p>



<p>What&#8217;s with that &#8220;I just remembered&#8221; reaction.</p>



<p>At least, that&#8217;s what I thought when I came here.</p>



<p>But as soon as she heard my words, her whole body, which had been so tense, in the end hangs down her head in dejection while .</p>



<p>[You are right&#8230;]</p>



<p>Sato-san affirmed it in the quietest voice ever.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;?</p>



<p>What&#8217;s with that haggard expression?</p>



<p>well, there are some things that bother me, but if she says so, then I guess she is.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m glad. I almost made the pleasant misunderstanding of thinking that [Sato-san had genuinely invited me to an after-school date].</p>



<p>To the bitter end,This is just the ring of the &#8220;Sato-san Minstagramming Project&#8221;.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get carried away. Don&#8217;t get carried away.</p>



<p>[Well let&#8217;s line up, Sato-san]</p>



<p>[Lining up,huh]</p>



<p>Sato-san,what happened to all the energy you had just now?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know why she felt so deflated, Sato-san and I lined up at the end of the line but&#8230;..</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s Hot]</p>



<p>[Yeah, it&#8217;s Hot]</p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s time to leave school,It&#8217;s early summer.</p>



<p>The sun, still high in the sky, was reflecting off the asphalt and burning the queue.</p>



<p>I felt that it was a bit of an anticlimax to be exposed to the heat while waiting in line to buy a nice drink.</p>



<p>Of course, there was no way I was going to leave, but there was one problem.</p>



<p>Let me confirm it for you again,Tapioca milk tea is a sweet drink that is popular among high school girls.</p>



<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that it is the most</p>



<p>Talked drink now, as it is mentioned on TV and sns every day.</p>



<p>The line for tapioca milk tea is almost 90% made up of high school girls, so what I am trying to say is,</p>



<p>[Yeah, it&#8217;s really hot.]</p>



<p>[Hey, look at this one, it&#8217;s soaked.]</p>



<p>[Haha, that&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s like a waterfall.]</p>



<p>The three high school girls in line in front of Sato-san and me were laughing and flapping their skirts as if they were fans.their sweaty chest peeking out from under their shirt collars.</p>



<p>I guess it&#8217;s what&#8217;s called a &#8216;high school girls only drinking party&#8217;.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening right in front of my eyes.</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun.]</p>



<p>When I was at a loss for where to look, Sato-san suddenly called out my name.</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s wrong?]</p>



<p>When I turned around, Sato-san was looking up at me with her glaring eyes&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[I just feel like calling you.]</p>



<p>What&#8217;s wrong with your face?</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not just a face, what&#8217;s wrong?]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right.let&#8217;s play staring down stare at each other game]</p>



<p>[Seriously, what&#8217;s wrong?]</p>



<p>I thought she was just a child who got misunderstood often for a long time but I seriously don&#8217;t understand the meaning now.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve never seen anyone propose a stare down with a wrinkled brow like that before.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m very good at staring]</p>



<p>[To begin with,I&#8217;ve never seen a high school girl give me a scowl before]</p>



<p>[LET&#8217;S PLAY]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;well,afufufu]</p>



<p>I had no choice but to helplessly make a funny face.</p>



<p>In response to this, Sato-san&#8217;s answer is&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s trying to do, but she keeps staring up at me with her brow furrowed. It&#8217;s like saying [I&#8217;m not going to miss a single move you make].</p>



<p>What&#8217;s this? Maybe a different game has started before he knows?</p>



<p>This is when I began to feel a certain shame alone.</p>



<p>Suddenly, one of the three high school girls in front of me &#8230;..</p>



<p>[Ahaha&#8230;.I can see through miko&#8217;s bra.]</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;a man is a deplorable creature.</p>



<p>Even if you&#8217;ve never met the person before, even if the person next to you is your first love, it&#8217;s imprinted in your instincts.</p>



<p>Almost reflexively, I tried to look sideways at the three high school girls, and &#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s no good.]</p>



<p>[Ouch!]</p>



<p>Pashiiiiiiiiiiiiiin</p>



<p>With a shout of anger, Sato-san&#8217;s right hand, like a bolt of lightning, swung out and struck the base of my nose. It hurts, it hurts so badly.</p>



<p>[Oh&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;it hurts.why, Sato-san?]</p>



<p>When I asked with teary eyes, Sato-san shook her shoulder and quivered,</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not good]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s not good, but she seemed to be very upset&#8230;..</p>



<p>Just like that,we waited for half an hour while burning by the sun.</p>



<p>A little troubled with Sato-san eccentricity,but I and Sato-san</p>



<p>Finally got it.</p>



<p>[Thank you for waiting.Here is your Assam Milk Tea Black Tapioca &amp; Milk Foam Topping]</p>



<p>The saleswoman recited the incantation with a 100-point sales smile and handed one to me and one to Sato-san.</p>



<p>Milk tea is filled in a transparent cup, a cloud-like milk foam on top of it.</p>



<p>And the black pearls that contrast with the beige milk tea with a slight transparency at the bottom of the cup are the protagonists of this drink and sweet.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;. That is tapioca.</p>



<p>When Sato-san received this, her eyes, which were black and round like tapioca, became even rounder.</p>



<p>Then she exhaled slightly.</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun, this is tapioca milk tea.]</p>



<p>[I know.]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but smile at her childish gesture.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure the rest of the class doesn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Sato-san, who has always had a clear face in the classroom, is so happy to see a cup of tapioca milk tea.</p>



<p>I feel a little superior when I think about it.</p>



<p>[Oh, Oshio, this, this! How can I take a good picture of this?]</p>



<p>Sato-san looked so excited that if add a little more she would jump up and down on the spot.</p>



<p>I would like to see that.i thought but I don&#8217;t want to bully her so I started to teach her about how to take a good tapioca milk tea picture.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s not much of a course, but</p>



<p>[I think the safest way is to take a picture with a signboard in the background.]</p>



<p>[With a sign in the background?]</p>



<p>[Yeah,look at it.]</p>



<p>[Oh, it&#8217;s delicious.]</p>



<p>this is what high school girls who are picky with thier taste are crazy about.</p>



<p>The tapioca was not too hard or too soft, but it had a pleasant elasticity to the teeth.The milk tea is not as sweet as I thought it would be.</p>



<p>This level of fragrance must have been made using good tea leaves.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll try to make it myself next time. &#8230;&#8230;.. If it turns out well, I can ask my dad to add it to the menu.</p>



<p>While I was thinking about this, Sato-san came running towards me like a penguin.</p>



<p>[I got it! Look, Oshio-kun!]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;You are fast.]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m already a little nervous at this point.</p>



<p>But Sato-san confidently puffs out her chest and holds out her phone to me.</p>



<p>I wondered how it was going to work, and sure enough…</p>



<p>[Hmm&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>It was purely a bad shot.</p>



<p>Because of poor positioning, the setting sun almost turned her Tapioca Milk Tea into a light.In addition to that, the tapioca milk tea was not in focus.</p>



<p>For some reason, her white, thin, and tense arms are in focus.The arm holding up a cup of tapioca milk tea high in the sky, almost as if it were light.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..western style poster?]</p>



<p>[Eh&#8230;&#8230;..I will be embarrassed if you praised me like that, Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not praising at all&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Hmmm&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think it looks that good.]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s it?]</p>



<p>I thought I could do the opposite.</p>



<p>Then just as I was troubled over how to explain it&#8230;..</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;ah&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;.Amazing Miko,as expected of big boobs.]</p>



<p>[Hurry up and record it! Take a video! It&#8217;s pretty hard since it&#8217;s making my boobs cold.]</p>



<p>[Hahaha&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s seriously good.]</p>



<p>In a corner a little farther away from Tea Pearl, there is a group of people who are getting excited about something.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>





<p>When I looked over there without thinking, I saw that one of the three high school girls in line in front of us was doing &#8220;that rumoured&#8221; pose with tapioca milk tea.</p>



<p>[Wow, someone can really do that?&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[That?]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Tapioca Challenge&#8221;, Sato-san.]</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;tapioca challenge.</p>



<p>A strange attempt that arose from sns beside the popular tapioca milk tea boom.</p>



<p>It is a very vulgar game in which a woman places a cup of tapioca milk tea on her chest and drinks tapioca milk tea from a straw without using her hands.</p>



<p>Because of its special trait, only females with very large breasts can do this. &#8230;.</p>



<p>[Amazing&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I naturally let out a sound.</p>



<p>The men on the street are also looking at it twice</p>



<p>My gaze was drawn to it before I could even think about how badly it was behaving.</p>



<p>It was already a special kind of acrobatic&#8230;&#8230;but then I realized the obvious fact that [it is not good to stare at a woman&#8217;s breasts too fixedly] so I turn towards Sato-san.</p>



<p>[Ah,sorry Sato-san, About the earlier photo&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more, Sato-san&#8217;s appearance look strange.</p>



<p>The cheeks are inflated into a round shape, and she is glaring at me with an expression that wants to say something.</p>



<p>When I was puzzled by her mysterious reaction, Sato-san asked in a stifled voice</p>



<p>[Do you like the one with the bigger boobs, Oshio-kun?]</p>



<p>I thought for a moment about the purpose of the question, and then the blood drained from my body.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;No way, did she think I was indecent because i was staring at the girls&#8217; breasts so much!?</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ve heard about it in rumours only but I didn&#8217;t thought anyone could really do that.]</p>



<p>Oh, why I am such a thoughtless person!.</p>



<p>of course Sato-san would not like to have such a dirty guy next to her!</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to be hated only by her&#8230;&#8230;ended&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Such a feeling of despair was about to fill me up,at that time</p>



<p>[I can do it too]</p>



<p>Surprisingly, what jumped out of Sato-san&#8217;s mouth was not a word of contempt, but such a word.</p>



<p>[Eh&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[I can do it too, tapioca challenge]</p>



<p>[Wait&#8230;.. that&#8217;s a little&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I was about to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s a bit impossible&#8230;..&#8221; when I hastily held my tongue.</p>



<p>Are you an idiot! Don&#8217;t you have delicacy!</p>



<p>But the reality is that Sato-san is probably incapable of taking the tapioca challenge.</p>



<p>She does have feminine breasts, and they may be slightly larger than average but&#8230;&#8230;..as expected&#8230;..</p>



<p>As I was thinking that far, I blushed realising that I was staring at the chest of my first love.</p>



<p>[I can do it! I will do it! Watch properly!]</p>



<p>On the other hand, Sato-san has become irritated for some reason, I don&#8217;t know what she is doing anymore.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;look at it properly]</p>



<p>[Wai&#8230;&#8230;.wait a little, Sato-san]</p>



<p>For the time being I tried to stop her but I wasy slow.</p>



<p>In order to perform the Tapioca Challenge, Sato-san turned her chest up and placed the cup on top of her raised twin hills.</p>



<p>It will spilled&#8230;&#8230;For a moment, the vision of Sato-san&#8217;s shirt soaking wet and teary-eyed flashed through my mind but&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[Oh&#8230;&#8230;ohhhhhh!!]</p>



<p>Without thinking,I let out my voice in administration.</p>



<p>Sato-san fixed the cup on her chest while in a dangerous situation where it could spill out on her.</p>



<p>[How is it&#8230;..oshio kun?]</p>



<p>I heard a pained, squeezing voice, so when I looked up,I saw Sato-san looking down at me with what is commonly called a smug face, her voice trembling from the impossible posture.</p>



<p>Amazing&#8230;.this is really amazing…</p>



<p>I forgot about my ulterior motives and was about to applaud purely, but then I realized something.</p>



<p>Her chest which was greatly warped, was soaked with water droplets from the cup that had condensed on it, and it was transparent in various ways</p>



<p>As I thought that, The next moment, one of the salary men on the street turns to look here&#8212;&#8212;-</p>



<p>[Sato-san!! ]</p>



<p>I almost reflexively raised my voice.</p>



<p>[What&#8230;&#8230;..uwaa&#8230;]</p>



<p>Surprised by this, Sato-san lost her balance and fell backwards. I roughly leaned forward and supported her slender body with my outstretched arm.</p>



<p>Time stopped, Inside of my heart turned blank.</p>



<p>Exposed to the strong western sun, I slowly begin to understand the current situation as if the ice is melting.</p>



<p>I was now holding Sato-san in my arms..</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>We both froze in that position and looked at each other in silence.</p>



<p>Our faces are close together, and I can feel her heat through shirt. Sato-san waist,thin.</p>



<p>[&#8230;. I am sorry]</p>



<p>[Same here]</p>



<p>I heard one of the three high school girls who had been looking at me from a distance muttering,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Hey, I&#8217;ll do that for my boyfriend next time.]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m dying of embarrassment.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>In the scorching sun, two people sit side by side on the bench in front of the tea pearls, drinking on their respective milk teas.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just ,silently taking their time, little by little.</p>



<p>The visibly diminishing milk tea is the time limit for me and Sato-san to remain silent.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;.and it&#8217;s almost gone.</p>



<p>At the same time, Sato-san&#8217;s straws made &#8220;zuzu&#8221; airy sound.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s awkward.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t look straight into the eyes of Sato-san.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever had such an awkward time in before&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Sato-san seemed to be feeling the same awkwardness as me, stirring the ice with a straw and fiddling with the ice in the cup.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..I can&#8217;t see the face.</p>



<p>only her face is looking away, obviously unnaturally.</p>



<p>I was hated by her.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no doubt, I&#8217;m completely hated.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not just the cold milk tea that&#8217;s making me feel strangely cold.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m such a coward to do nothing.</p>



<p>I know that she already hates me, but I can&#8217;t tell.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to be hated more than I already am.Those miserable feelings aren&#8217;t coming out from my mouth.</p>



<p>The only thing I could say was just one word, [I&#8217;m sorry Sato-san for earlier]&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Sa&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Making up my mind,I somehow started to pull words to say but I swallowed them back.for what reason?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s because I could see Sato-san&#8217;s shoulders trembling little by little.</p>



<p>[Sato-san&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>[Tsu&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>When I call her name, Sato-san&#8217;s body turns stiff with a jump.</p>



<p>Ah&#8230;&#8230;.. don&#8217;t cry Sato-san&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230;..I&#8217;m really sorry, Oshio-kun.]</p>



<p>For some reason, it was a word of apology that came out from Sato-san&#8217;s quivering voice.</p>



<p>[As expected, I&#8217;m no good&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..no matter what I tried to do]</p>



<p>Her slender fingers traced the straw with little effort, the ice in it making a crunching sound.</p>



<p>[I can&#8217;t even do the same thing as everyone else, even if Oshio-kun takes the trouble to help me. Even this tapioca milk tea, which I drank even though I haven&#8217;t taken a single proper picture of it yet&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Her Finger tracing the straw was shivering.</p>



<p>Her head went down slightly.</p>



<p>And at any moment, drop of water is about to spill from her large eyes. &#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Sato-san]</p>



<p>At that moment,Before I could think, my body moved..</p>



<p>I close the distance between us and draw near the shoulder of Sato-san.</p>



<p>[Wha&#8230;.wait a min Oshio-kun, currently]</p>



<p>Sato-san hides her face.</p>



<p>I took her hand and held the empty cup of tapioca milk tea high in the air.</p>



<p>[What are you&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I took her other free hand and put it on my phone.</p>



<p>And then</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-pikon.</p>



<p>My phone made a dumb sound and I captured the scene.</p>



<p>[Didn&#8217;t I say it earlier,&#8230;&#8230;.It&#8217;s not the tapioca milk tea itself that&#8217;s important, it&#8217;s where the tapioca milk tea is from.]</p>



<p>Sato-san took a breath looking at the display of smartphone.</p>



<p>ice.</p>



<p>There, with the Tea Pearl sign in the background, was a transparent cup, gleaming in the sunlight through the ice.</p>



<p>[Beautiful.]</p>



<p>[Sato-san mutters dreamily]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>I let out a smile at her innocent reaction.</p>



<p>[You can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re not good at yourself, Because I&#8217;m sure there are people who like Sato-san]</p>



<p>[There isn&#8217;t]</p>



<p>[Yes, there are, definitely, lots of them.]</p>



<p>At least, there&#8217;s one here.</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t need a lot of&#8230;&#8230;.I just&#8230;]</p>



<p>Mr. Sato said that much, then closed his mouth with a pained expression.</p>



<p>In the silence, the faint sound of high school girls laughing seemed rather distant.</p>



<p>After a few moments of silence, Sato-san slowly opened her mouth and said</p>



<p>[Next Saturday&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[Yes?]</p>



<p>[Next Saturday.]</p>



<p>She repeated it again and took a deep breath.</p>



<p>Then she turned to me,</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m thinking of going out for ice cream rolls this Saturday, and I was wondering if Oshio-kun would like to come along.]</p>



<p>She said it quickly, her face fell, either from embarrassment or from the thought that she might be rejected.</p>



<p>It was an earnest request, not something you would expect from a friend.</p>



<p>Whether from anxiety or helplessness,her shoulders tremble little by little.</p>



<p>When I saw that, my chest tightened, but &#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[&#8230;.. I&#8217;m sorry, I have something to do that day.]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of face Sato-san had on at that time.</p>



<p>but one thing&#8217;s for sure&#8230;&#8230;Her shoulders weren&#8217;t shaking anymore.</p>



<p>[But don&#8217;t worry, Sato-san can take such great pictures, even without my help.]</p>



<p>Even though I knew in my head that I shouldn&#8217;t, I couldn&#8217;t help but repeat the words.</p>



<p>Sato-san then lifted his head and smiled back at me somewhat weakly&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Ye&#8230;.yes, I&#8217;m sorry.It was a little abrupt, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>When I saw her smile dyed red I felt as if my heart was being crushed.</p>



<p>Seeing that smile&#8230;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not sure if she knew how I felt or not, but she stood up from the bench and said,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Thank you for today, Oshio-kun.Then, Should we go back?]</p>



<p>In the sunlight, she looks back at me as if dancing.</p>



<p>The way she looked back at me, dancing in the sun, was terribly beautiful, terribly fragile, and&#8230;&#8230;somewhat sad.</p>



<p>Saturday</p>



<p>It was around five o&#8217;clock in the evening, and I had finally finished all my cafe&#8217;s work for the day.</p>



<p>[Okay, I&#8217;m done cleaning up&#8230;&#8230;.Dad, you want some tea?]</p>



<p>I asked as I took off my apron, but there was no answer.</p>



<p>Thinking that it was a little strange,i looked over and saw Tou-san in the kitchen, using his abdominal muscles to emphasize his strong lower body.</p>



<p>I wondered if he meant he was there?</p>



<p>Oh well, I&#8217;ll get him one anyway.</p>



<p>I started to make tea.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been five days since the day I went to Tea Pearl with Sato-san.</p>



<p>Since then, Sato-san and I haven&#8217;t spoken a word.</p>



<p>As if Mine uproar of that day was a lie, Sato-san returned back to her usual &#8220;salty Sato-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>Like an untouchable flower&#8230;&#8230; naturally,I wasn&#8217;t an exception.</p>



<p>How did it turn out? I didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>But surely, I think the reason lie on our last conversation.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I&#8217;m thinking of going out for ice cream rolls this Saturday! If you don&#8217;t mind, Oshio-kun, would you come with me?</p>



<p>The words she desperately said out reappeared in my mind.</p>



<p>What was the right answer for me?</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..No, maybe there was no right answer in the first place.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t like she couldn&#8217;t take a picture even if she was alone.</p>



<p>Thinking that my refusal of Sato-san&#8217;s invitation had changed her might have been a huge mistake.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll continue to act like the &#8220;salty Sato-san&#8221; at school as she did before, but on weekends she&#8217;ll go to trendy cafes and keep taking pictures.</p>



<p>Given her lack of photographic sense, she will probably have a hard time at first, but after a few times she will gradually improve.</p>



<p>Then one day she will upload the photo to Minsta, her classmates who see it will change their perception of Sato-san and make friends with her&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>See, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..The only one who has a problem with that is me.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I thought about it while steaming the tea leaves.</p>



<p>Sato-san is cute.</p>



<p>The more I learn about her, the more I realize how attractive she is, not only for her face, but also for the way she smiles sometimes, her surprisingly childish smile, and her small gestures.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll make lots of friends and be very popular if she can get rid of the disgraceful title of &#8220;Salt-god Sato-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>For example, she&#8217;ll be confessed by the fresh and handsome members of the soccer club or basketball club.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Imagining all of that,his chest pained.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m such an idiot.</p>



<p>As I thought about it,I pulled my phone out of my pocket, launched the Minsta app, and opened that page I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of times.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-It was Sato koharu Minsta account, which she had registered &#8220;that night&#8221;.</p>



<p>She had zero followers and 0 total number of photos posted.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a brand new account without even a profile picture set up.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. She probably didn&#8217;t know that when she created her account, it would automatically notify her MINE friends.</p>



<p>Today, the total number of photos posted is still zero.</p>



<p>[Haha&#8230;]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh dryly at my own timidity.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m relieved to see that no photos have been posted today&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help it, I can&#8217;t help it.</p>



<p>As I gave myself excuses, I made myself a cup of tea and headed down to the terrace to wait for my dad. &#8212;-</p>



<p>[Muscles are crying.]</p>



<p>Tou-san, who sat deep in the Garden chair, said something that didn&#8217;t make sense</p>



<p>[Ha?]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a simple reaction.</p>



<p>What are you saying,this muscular durama.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;What are muscles doing?]</p>



<p>[I already told you, Muscles are crying.]</p>



<p>[I didn&#8217;t understand the point of going through circles.]</p>



<p>Tou-san sipped from his teacup with graceful gestures.</p>



<p>&#8230;..He.stop drinking and answer me.</p>



<p>[Souta, since Sakiko&#8230;&#8230;.Since your mother passed away, I&#8217;ve been protecting this cafe tutuji and Sota with my own hands. Both of them are irreplaceable and precious things left by your mother.]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m really grateful for that, but why are you talking about it now?]</p>



<p>[There&#8217;s nothing I don&#8217;t know about this Cafe and Sota.]</p>



<p>[What are you trying to say?]</p>



<p>[Sota, you&#8217;re about to give up the girl you love for me and cafe tutuji, right?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I shut my mouth tightly however that reaction affirmed it.</p>



<p>[Why did you&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[Fufu, I can understand just by looking at your face.I&#8217;ve seen Souta&#8217;s face more than I&#8217;ve seen pancakes]</p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s a lie,he knows his son best.</p>



<p>[It can&#8217;t be helped.]</p>



<p>Anyway,it&#8217;s useless to keep it away from Tou-san.I feel relieved and started talking,</p>



<p>[Cafe tutuji is good for customers, but not enough that it can afford to hire employee.I know that much.]</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve grown up in this Cafe tutuji&nbsp; since I was born, just looking at the concrete number is enough to tell me about the situation.</p>



<p>[I know Tou-san won&#8217;t tell me this, but for example If I were to go out on a date with a girl I&#8217;m interested in on the weekend, he&#8217;ll be in trouble. I know that much]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right,that was the reason to refuse Sato-san&#8217;s invitation.</p>



<p>Cafe tutuji can&#8217;t afford to hire a part-time worker.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why, most importantly, if I leave this place on weekends and leave my dad alone, the store will not be able to function well.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable blaming my dad, so I didn&#8217;t tell Sato-san the reason&#8230;</p>



<p>[There is nothing I can do about this,cafe tutuji is also an important place for me.</p>



<p>Thanks to the promotion at Minsta, It&#8217;s on track now, but I can&#8217;t do that]</p>



<p>This was my untrue and honest feeling.</p>



<p>Of course I like Sato-san. But I love this place just as much.</p>



<p>Tou-san listened to me quietly as he rolled the tea in the mouth.</p>



<p>After a while, he poured the tea down his throat and slowly opened his mouth to say: &#8212;-</p>



<p>[That was back in college when I was in the sweets club together with like minded members.]</p>



<p>[what are you saying suddenly?]</p>



<p>[Shut up and listen.]</p>



<p>I had no choice but to listen to him.</p>



<p>He coughed, and then resumed his story.</p>



<p>[The Sweets Club was a small group of four guys who worked together in a very peaceful way, we were captivated by sweetness and calories.]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a great club.</p>



<p>I was tempted to complain aloud, but my father was unusually sincere, so I decided to keep quiet.</p>



<p>[But a turning point came when Tou-san was a 3rd student, someone called &#8220;Lord Muscle,&#8221; who had been expelled from the football club, asked to join us.]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m curious about that nickname, but&#8230;&#8230;expelled from the football team? Why?]</p>



<p>[It seems that he was hiddenly putting protein on the drinks of the members.]</p>



<p>Why is that!?</p>




<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>[As it&#8217;s name implies, Muscle Lord was so fascinated by muscles that&#8230;… he had fallen to the muscle side because of strange obsession to them]</p>



<p>Where is the muscle side, where does it come from!?</p>



<p>[After being expelled from the football circle who hated him for his radical ideas and excessive muscle appearance, the muscle lord fled to our club, which was relatively peaceful and free from the influence of the football circle.]</p>



<p>[What does Tou-san and others do?]</p>



<p>[We accepted him.We were like brothers in the same pancake.]</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t say it like rice in the same pot,it&#8217;s disgusting.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;So?that muscle obsessed person&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>Tou-san smiled at me and said,</p>



<p>[He added the protein in our pancakes.]</p>



<p>[That guy is already a psychopath.]</p>



<p>I finally got it out of my mouth.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s already beyond hope.</p>



<p>[So because of excessive protein,we became fat and started diet.we impose harsh muscle training and before we know it,our body turned muscular as muscle lord expected.]</p>



<p>[So those muscle origins were such an obsession&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I get to know what I don&#8217;t want to.</p>



<p>[So we who were mad at being deceived fought the muscle lord&#8230;..well one thing led to another and in the end we reconciled.]</p>



<p>[Isn&#8217;t that one thing led to another point most important…]</p>



<p>[No, what&#8217;s important is that in this struggle we&#8217;ve learned the merits of muscle, and Lord Muscle was also reformed and stopped forcing unwanted muscle on us.]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;. psychopath lord finally got his human heart back.]</p>



<p>[Well that person was Souta&#8217;s Okaa-san.]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..haaaa!!?</p>



<p>[Okaa-san was the muscle lord!?]</p>



<p>I froze for a while at such shocking news.</p>



<p>What!?&#8230;..wai&#8230;it must be a lie, right!?</p>



<p>Okaa-san who is smiling gracefully inside the portrait of&nbsp;</p>



<p>deceased person was the muscle lord!?</p>



<p>[Oops,the story derailed&#8230;&#8230;what was it?]</p>



<p>[No, derailment of story or anything, I don&#8217;t remember due to excessive shocking news.]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right, it was the talk about Souta&#8217;s muscle crying.]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right but&#8230;?</p>



<p>As I tilted my head,&nbsp; my father turned to look at me with a kind smile.</p>



<p>[Souta, Muscles grow only when they start hurting, just like your mother and father.]</p>



<p>[What&#8230;?]</p>



<p>I stared back at my father When he started talking quietly unlike before.</p>



<p>[Souta, People get hurt when they touch other people, it hurts and it&#8217;s painful, but the muscles are happy, they are happy to grow after this.Thats why if muscle start crying then it&#8217;s the time they might lost the chance to get hurt.]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..I see, did you want to bring the story that way?</p>



<p>&nbsp;But, even if you said that&#8230;.</p>



<p>[It can&#8217;t be helped, for practical problems.]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not that it can&#8217;t be helped!.]</p>



<p>Father screams and snaps his finger.</p>



<p>As I thought just what in the world does that mean&#8212;&#8211;Suddenly, some of the bushes in the garden start to rustle, and three strange muscular Daruma appear from within.</p>



<p>In this unusual situation, I unconsciously stepped back.</p>



<p>[What? What&#8217;s going on? Suspicious people!]</p>



<p>[They aren&#8217;t suspicious people, they are Tou-san fellow clubmates.]</p>



<p>[What!?&#8230; doesn&#8217;t that mean&#8230;no way]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right, all from sweet club.]</p>



<p>[So foolish talk just now was preparation for this?]</p>



<p>When I shouted, as if to affirm to me they each struck the pose, appealing Their muscles.</p>



<p>No, what kind of situation is this!? Seriously that situation&#8212;-</p>



<p>[Actually, I asked them to help me at my cafe only on weekends.]</p>



<p>[Eh&#8230;why?]</p>



<p>When I was completely bewildered by the succession of new revelations, Tou-san smiled gently at me,</p>



<p>[Isn&#8217;t that already obvious? It&#8217;s so that souta can do what he wants to. It&#8217;s a disqualification of a father to snatch away the chance of getting hurt from a<em> child who wants to be hurt</em>.No,rather..]</p>



<p>Saying that far, Tou-san got up from the chair, bowed deeply to his own son, and said,</p>



<p>[Thank you for everything till now.Thanks to souta,he made it this far.Thats why leave the rest to Tou-san and do what souta wanted to do.]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Those were words of gratitude that were straight to the point.</p>



<p>At that time I feel like the weight from my shoulder vanishes like smoke.</p>



<p>And&#8212;-I&#8217;m sure god must have been watching.</p>



<p>Smartphone inside my pocket vibrates.</p>



<p>When I picked it up at, I saw a system message from Mine on the phone&#8217;s display&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sato koharu has posted her first photo to Minsta!&#8221;</p>



<p>I resolve my decision.</p>



<p>[Tou-san, I&#8217;m borrowing your bicycle for a while.]</p>



<p>As soon as I said that, I jumped on the bike parked in front of the store in my work clothes and pedaled off into the wind.</p>



<p>I swept past Cafe tutuji and headed towards her&#8212;-</p>



<p>[Good luck souta, Tou-san is always rooting for you.]</p>



<p>At the sound of my father&#8217;s encouragement coming from far behind me, the sun in my eyes blurred a little, but I didn&#8217;t look back.</p>

<p>♠️</p>



<p>&#8220;aytim9&#8221;</p>



<p>This is a recently opened store in our town that specializes in rolled ice cream.</p>



<p>To begin with, rolled ice cream is made by spreading a thin layer of liquid cream on a cold, hot griddle, scraping it with a spatula, rolling it up, and placing it in a cup.</p>



<p>Not to mention The process of making it, as well as the ice-cream decorated like the petals of a tulip.</p>



<p>I have seen an article on the net that that kind of Fancy sweet is popular in highschool girls.</p>



<p>[With this&#8230;it&#8217;s ok.]</p>



<p>After much deliberation, I uploaded the photo of the ice cream roll to Minstagram, [haaaa&#8230;..] And let out a deep sigh of relief.</p>



<p>Finally, I have finally done it.</p>



<p>The exhaustion was overwhelming me. I never thought that posting a single photo on the Internet would be so nerve-wracking.I had no idea that posting a single photo on the Internet was such a nerve-wracking experience.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I wonder what kind of reaction I will get.</p>



<p>I wonder what kind of response I&#8217;ll get.Did I take a good picture?</p>



<p>Comments? Tagging?</p>



<p>Is it a highschool girl?</p>



<p>A feeling of regret is going around in my head.</p>



<p>To begin with since I have zero followers, it seems wrong to even think about what kind of response I will get. &#8230;.</p>



<p>[As expected, Oshio-kun is amazing&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Those words naturally come out from her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212; Wow, Oshio is amazing.</p>



<p>I have 0 followers and I&#8217;m worried about this but Oshio-kun has 5,000 followers.</p>



<p>He keeps uploading fashionable photos every day. That means he is living up to the expectations of 5,000 people whose names he doesn&#8217;t even know.</p>



<p>5000, I can&#8217;t even imagine.Even my classmates only count to 40 people.</p>



<p>Oshio-kun really is amazing&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>I blushed when I realized that I was trying to open the official account page of Minsta&#8217;s cafe tutuji quite naturally.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I hurriedly turned off the smartphone.</p>



<p>Again I&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Even when I come here alone to eat ice cream, all I am thinking about is Oshio-kun!</p>



<p>And just how many times did I access the official account of Cafe tutuji in a day?</p>



<p>Because I feel like I have already seen it a million times already.</p>



<p>Maybe a stalker is born like this, isn&#8217;t it.</p>



<p>Somehow I hate myself for falling into evil.</p>



<p>[Let&#8217;s eat ice cream&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Yes,in the end ice cream is the main thing.</p>



<p>Scoop the ice cream with a plastic spoon and carry it to the mouth.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s delicious, un, it&#8217;s probably delicious.</p>



<p>But&#8230;&#8230;I wonder what&#8217;s it?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s that delicious.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t tell the difference between ice cream that melts on your tongue and ice cream sold cheaply at the grocery store.It even cost 800 yen&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Suddenly, I look around.</p>



<p>There were a few young girls sparsely seated at the table, laughing and poking on ice cream deliciously.</p>



<p>I wonder if my taste has turned strange.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Taking one more bite, as expected it&#8217;s not delicious.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never had anything like this before.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t enough to leave behind, so I half-heartedly scraped the ice cream off the spoon and repeatedly put it in my mouth. It was more like disposing than eating.</p>



<p>As I mindlessly put ice cream into my mouth like a Robot, I can&#8217;t help but think about him.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-Oshio-Kun, he really is kind.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;ve been spoiled by his kindness.</p>



<p>Oshio-kun was always kind.</p>



<p>I guess he&#8217;s the kind of person who can&#8217;t leave a person in trouble like me alone.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure that nothing has changed since the day he gave me a Konpeito on the day of the entrance exam.</p>



<p>[Tl note-In case you guys forgot,Konpeito is a small coloured sugar candy.]</p>



<p>Helping me out in Café tutuji, taking me to the room and teaching me how to take photos and also going for drinking tapioca milk tea together, all of it was his kindness.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m special, he&#8217;s kind to everyone.</p>



<p>I knew that all along&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Re-thinking back to that day.</p>



<p>About that day, Oshio and I drank tapioca milk tea together.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>I had misunderstood Oshio&#8217;s kindness somewhere in my heart, and I said the decisive words.</p>



<p>&#8212;- I&#8217;m thinking of going out for ice cream rolls this Saturday! If it&#8217;s ok with Oshio-kun, would you like to come with me?</p>



<p>I invited Oshio-kun for <em>Date</em>.</p>



<p>Regarding that, Oshio-kun replied with a terribly troubled face.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;sorry, I have an errand to do that day.</p>



<p>If it had been just this, I would have been very disappointed, but I am not sure if I have taken the words as they were meant.</p>



<p>But he cared for me and kept going.</p>



<p>But don&#8217;t worry, Sato-san can take such great pictures, even without my help.</p>



<p>If you say this much, even I, a person who is not familiar with love affairs, will understand.</p>



<p>I crossed a line that I shouldn&#8217;t have crossed in order to be friends and made the kind Oshio-kun reject me.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>With a shakushaku sound, I continued to shave off ice cream.</p>



<p>The ice cream rolls, which originally look so good, are getting dirtier and jerky.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..At the first place,why did I decide to aim for becoming minstagrammar?</p>



<p>To make friends&#8230; &#8230;.. Of course, that was there, but I don&#8217;t think it was the final goal.</p>



<p>Because I wasn&#8217;t that troubled even if I don&#8217;t have any friends.</p>



<p>Then,why is that so?</p>



<p>Giving it a little thought, I realised it soon.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right&#8212;&#8211;to get closer to Oshio-kun.</p>



<p>In order to get closer to Oshio-kun, who is cool and kind to everyone, I decided to become a full-fledged high school girl and started doing stupid things like this.</p>



<p>Even if I don&#8217;t have any friends or no charm, I thought that if I became a glittering Minstagrammar , I would be on the same stage as him&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>But that was a shallow idea.</p>



<p>From a long time, Oshio-kun was an unattainable flower, which was impossible for me to touch.</p>



<p>And finally, it disappeared from my scope of vision.</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;. that&#8217;s right.]</p>



<p>I totally understand as I eat the terribly salty ice cream.</p>



<p>The 800 yen ice cream, which should have been delicious, why it&#8217;s not delicious.</p>



<p>Oshio-kun said before, what&#8217;s important isn&#8217;t tapioca milk tea.</p>



<p>I particularly didn&#8217;t want to eat pancakes, drink tapioca milk tea or even eat ice cream.</p>



<p>I just wanted to be on the same frame as Oshio-kun.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>As emotions started overflowing I couldn&#8217;t endure anymore and downcast my face.</p>



<p>A strange floating feeling wraps around the whole body, making me feel uncomfortable enough to vomit.</p>



<p>The laughter of the high school girls feel so distant that it seems as if it is coming from another dimension.</p>



<p>And I feel as if I am the only one in the world.</p>



<p>I remember this feeling.</p>



<p>But this feeling of being crushed in the depths of the ocean was much more compared to that day.</p>



<p>Because My first love, which comes in life only for one time, had just now dissipated.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>As if wishing for help,I said his name.</p>



<p>As if it becomes the signal, the dam Inside me started to break, at that time&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>A coat gently covers me from my head to all over completely.</p>



<p>[&#8230;..what?]</p>



<p>Suddenly the upper half of my field of vision is covered, and the emotions that overflow from me are pulled back.</p>



<p>What,what is it&#8230;&#8230;?</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s bad if your body gets cold, so use it.]</p>



<p>Suddenly, a voice comes from above my head, the voice that I had even dreamed of.</p>



<p>At this time,I really had the illusion that my thumping heart stopped suddenly.</p>



<p>Dressed in his Cafetutuji uniform, he slowly sat down on the seat opposite me and placed his own ice cream roll on the table.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t see him because of the coat covering my upper half but I understood.</p>



<p>I understand his gentle voice and his beautiful fingers.</p>



<p>As soon as he got to the table, he scooped up an ice cream with a plastic spoon and put it in his mouth.</p>



<p>Here for the first time I looked up and saw him.</p>



<p>Holding spoon,somewhat mischievously but kindly.</p>



<p>[Oh, I ate it before I could take a picture&#8230;&#8230;. Ah well, it&#8217;s not very tasty, is it?]</p>



<p>Saying so,Oshio smiled at me as usual.</p>



<p>I hate my own naivety for getting even a little carried away.</p>



<p>I squeezed the jacket over my head and put it on even deeper.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want Oshio-kun to look at such a face.</p>



<p>[Ha&#8230;.haha, how did you know I was there Oshio-kun?&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I somehow managed to let out a shaky voice.If I let my guard down even a little bit, I would be going to explode again.</p>



<p>[Besides that, didn&#8217;t you have an errand to do today&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>After I said that, I was disgusted by my own bad character.</p>



<p>However, if I don&#8217;t do that,I will misunderstand it again.</p>



<p>Of course it&#8217;s already decided, Oshio-kun only pitied a gloomy woman like me who was eating ice cream rolls alone&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;yes, but I really wanted to eat ice cream rolls with Sato-san, so I cut out early to run an errand.]</p>



<p>[What&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but raise my head.</p>



<p>Hereupon, Oshio held his mouth with his hand, his gaze slanting downward with an expression I&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>



<p>Oshio-kun,his face is red&#8230;..</p>



<p>[&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry, that sounded like I was hitting on you.]</p>



<p>[Eh.. how?]</p>



<p>Suddenly, my face became hot as if it was on fire, and I quickly retracted into the shell of my jacket and looked back at Table.</p>



<p>No, that isn&#8217;t it.It&#8217;s not how a highschool girl will say.</p>



<p>[So&#8230;&#8230;..so it&#8217;s like that.haha]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a haha.Already, I didn&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s the right response anymore.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t look at Oshio-kun&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>I was looking down at my empty ice cream cup, frozen&#8212;&#8212;it was at that time.</p>



<p>I heard the sound of taking a deep breath twice or three times from above, and immediately after that, something slipped into my field of vision.</p>



<p>[What&#8230;?]</p>



<p>It was Oshio-kun smartphone.</p>



<p>What displayed on the screen was the photo of ice cream I had uploaded on Minsta.</p>



<p>I was surprised that Oshio-kun knew my Minsta account, but even more surprised that it had already been almost 30 minute since I uploaded the photo.</p>



<p>It seems I&#8217;ve been so absent-minded that I&#8217;ve even lost track of time.</p>



<p>[&#8230;. about how I know you are here, first of all there aren&#8217;t many store who serve ice cream roll in sakuraba.in addition with mint on cream, you don&#8217;t even have to guess around since there&#8217;s no one but &#8220;aytim 9&#8221;.]</p>



<p>Oshio-kun said like a detective and pointed to the tags I have set up.</p>



<p>When I saw it, I certainly forgot to tag the store name.</p>



<p>Oshio told me that it&#8217;s important where I ate, but what an elementary mistake I made,I started to hate myself.</p>



<p>At that point&#8230;..</p>



<p>[As expected, Oshio-kun is amazing.]</p>



<p>I muttered with self-deprecation while staring at Oshio-kun smartphone.</p>



<p>Not good, I can&#8217;t control my emotions anymore.</p>



<p>[Not only do you work as an employee at a stylish café, but you also have much more knowledge than I do and you&#8217;re a great photographer&#8230;&#8230;haha, I&#8217;m losing confidence.]</p>



<p>That was a lie.The truth is that my fragile confidence was shattered long ago.</p>



<p>The more I know about Oshio-kun, the more I understand that he is not within my reach.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..I think I might have gotten a little carried away, uploading these crappy pictures to Minstagram and wanting to be a Minstagrammer&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; I guess might be better to delete it&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I said in a shaky voice.</p>



<p>Hereupon, Oshio-kun answer to that was&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Yes, they are terrible.]</p>



<p>I tied my mouth tightly at his harsh words.</p>



<p>I knew it,I should have known that.</p>



<p>[First, you have taken the photo from too high position, then aytim9 logo is on the side but it&#8217;s not reflected properly and the filter is also strange.]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I knew it.i should have known it all along&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, it&#8217;s sad to be told directly from Oshio&#8217;s mouth&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>When the inner corner of the eye gets hot and a drop of water is about to fall off&#8230;.</p>



<p>[But they are much better than me]</p>



<p>Oshio&#8217;s thin finger bounces on the display, switching the screen of the smartphone.</p>



<p>And when I saw what was projected there, I was surprised.</p>



<p>[This is&#8230;..]</p>



<p>What was projected out was a pancake from cafetutuji.</p>



<p>But, how should I say it&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; Compared to the one on Minsta&#8217;s official account,</p>



<p>[They are terrible, right? This is the first pancake photo I&#8217;ve taken.]</p>



<p>[What?]</p>



<p>Oshio said with a bitter smile, I inadvertently jumped out of the shell of my jacket and raised my face.</p>



<p>[This &#8230;&#8230; Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>[But, but such photo on the official account of Cafe tutuji]</p>



<p>Ah, Mouth slipped.</p>



<p>This makes people think I&#8217;m a creepy person who checks all the 300 pictures uploaded to cafetutujjua&#8217;s official account&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>However, fortunately for me, Oshio-kun didn&#8217;t seem to particularly care about what I said.</p>



<p>[Yes, they sucks too much so I didn&#8217;t upload it&#8230;&#8230;look here]</p>



<p>Saying that, Oshio-kun starts scrolling the photo folder.</p>



<p>I was surprised.</p>



<p>A huge number of photos of pancakes lined up from one end of the screen to the other.</p>



<p>[Here&#8217;s a pancake that was shot too high up and turned into a sun circle, here&#8217;s a backlit pancake, and here&#8217;s a pancake from &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;this is a pancake that was taken too long and the butter is completely melted.]</p>



<p>[Wai&#8230;&#8230;.wait! How many are there Oshio-kun?.]</p>



<p>[I wonder if I took about 1000 photos until I uploaded the first photo in Minsta?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s more than double the number of photos uploaded to Minsta by cafetutuji.</p>



<p>Just for the sake of uploading one photo, Oshio-kun have&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[I started Minsta with a light hearted desire to help my dad, but when I got into it, I realized that it was a lot more than that, when I was taking the first photo to upload, my hands didn&#8217;t stopped sweating, how many times did I get lost trying to erase it?]</p>



<p>[I thought that Oshio-kun could do something like that easily.]</p>



<p>[Haha, isn&#8217;t it impossible for sure?I studied like crazy nevertheless i was still anxious.but&#8212;-]</p>



<p>Oshio&#8217;s finger bounces over the smartphone to display the photo I uploaded to Minsta again.</p>



<p>[I and Sato-san both have uploaded photos in Minsta,at this point you are already a minstagrammar.]</p>



<p>He said this, and smiled kindly.</p>



<p>Seeing that smile, I thought&#8230;&#8230;.Oh, what an idiot.</p>



<p>[By the way, Sato-san, it seems that a shaved ice shop that is Minsta worthy has recently opened in the neighboring town.As an apology, Would you like to go with me next weekend? This time I couldn&#8217;t eat the ice cream rolls together.]</p>



<p>My chest is painful and my body trembles naturally.</p>



<p>[But I sucks at taking pictures&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[I will teach you.]</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t have anything interesting to say, and I don&#8217;t have any friends.]</p>



<p>[I can&#8217;t say anything interesting either.]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m not at all like highschool girl but, still then]</p>



<p>I raised my face and looked at Oshio-kun.</p>



<p>[Still then&#8230;.will you go with me?]</p>



<p>With a little shy voice, Oshio-kun replies,</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8211;I want to go together with Sato-san.]</p>



<p>That smile is foul!</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but fall flat on my face. I didn&#8217;t want him to see my face now.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m an idiot.Truly an idiot.</p>



<p>I never thought I&#8217;d fall in love with my first love all over again.</p>
