<h2>Chapter 3 &#8211; I, to Sato-san….</h2>



<p>A man&#8217;s vanity is a trivial thing, but it is not something to be discarded lightly.</p>



<p>The only time he throws it away without hesitation is when he is chasing after a woman he is in love with.</p>



<p>These are not the words of a great man, but the words of my good friend, Misono Ren.</p>



<p>Incidentally, the person in question Misono Ren, the day after he said this line, he got down on his knees and asked his ex-girlfriend to get back together with him, but she despised him and kicked him in the head or not.</p>



<p>Even though he throw away the pride, noteworthy point as a man, as human yet what was left for him was such treatment……. he remember feeling a little sad even though it was someone else..</p>



<p>Anyway, the result was somehow good.</p>



<p>The time for a man to abandon his vanity is when he is chasing after the woman he loves.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Then now is the time.</p>



<p>[I have an request.]</p>



<p>I opened up Misono Ren&#8217;s chatroom on MINE that night and sent him the sentence on the right. It was read right away, paused for a few seconds, and then,</p>



<p>&#8220;Depends on the thing&#8221;</p>



<p>Though he only say that,I quickly send him the next sentence i prepared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Help me choose the clothes to wear for Saturday&#8217;s date&#8221;</p>



<p>[Nevertheless Souta, you have aim for a great place, it&#8217;s &#8220;Salt-god Sato-san&#8221;, isn&#8217;t?]</p>



<p>After school, the day after I sent message on Mine, Ren, who was walking next to him, said that without any context, to which I froze for a while.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s natural to noticed, after all there is &#8220;Mine clamor&#8221;.</p>



<p>When I affirmed it with some embreassment, [hahaha] Ren laughed.</p>



<p>[I thought you weren&#8217;t interest in love but to actually aim for<br>that Sato-san, no matter how prominent that position is, good or bad, I would never be able to aim.You have my respect a bit.]</p>



<p>[……….]</p>



<p>Dammit, heartless…..if such guy wasn&#8217;t my best friend, I would have break our friendship….what a contradictory anger I&#8217;m feeling.</p>



<p>[By the way, that mean everyone knows?]</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>[That I am aiming for Sato-san…….]</p>



<p>When I asked him nervously, Ren lifted his corner of mouth in a noticeably evil style.By the way, I believe that a person&#8217;s character comes out in the way they laugh.</p>



<p>As far as I know, this is the only person with such a twisted smile on his face.</p>



<p>[No, I&#8217;m the only one who knows you are aiming for her.]</p>



<p>[Oh, is that so? That&#8217;s really unexpected.]</p>



<p>[The rest of the class think you are already going out from a long time.]</p>



<p>[What!]</p>



<p>I spat out.</p>



<p>Happy from From the reaction he wanted, [Hahaha]<br>Ren erupted in wild laughed.</p>



<p>[Goi… going out, You, I and Sato san have nothing…..]</p>



<p>[Hahaha, I know, I know from your display of virgin reaction..]</p>



<p>I bite on my teeth so hard that sound can be heard.</p>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have killied him if not for him to be my best friend…..</p>



<p>[No, seriously, recently all the boys have been screaming, what hand Oshio used to have that &#8220;Salt-god Sato-san&#8221; fall for him</p>



<p>[Why I&#8217;m hearing it from Ren……!]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s because they are bunch of good for nothing who are afraid to talk with &#8220;salt god Sato san&#8221;, there&#8217;s no way they have the courage to ask from the person in question directly….hahaha]</p>



<p>[Ugh…]</p>



<p>Hahaha,Ren continued with his wild laughter.</p>



<p>There must have been one or two devil inside that stupidly open wide mouth.</p>



<p>[Well you are a virgin, but a virgin with enough guts, an accomplished virgin.]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t say virgin, virgin too much]</p>



<p>[Am I wrong?]</p>



<p>[………]</p>



<p>I grind my teeth.</p>



<p>Ren is like a fish who has found the water, pressing for answer as he laughed.</p>



<p>[Hahaha, without even asking, even though you are already in second year of high school yet requesting me to choose clothes for date somehow hahahaha]</p>



<p>[…….You will drop to hell someday]</p>



<p>[At that time I will take you alone too.]</p>



<p>Ren says it mischievously and poked me with his elbow.</p>



<p>This person habit of making fool…..there really hasn&#8217;t anything about this guy since middle school time.</p>



<p>I think you mighy have already understand by now, he has a bad mouth&#8212;or rather straightforward bad personality, arrogant and lazy,loose in every thing yet somehow popular with women.He is a man whose very existence symbolizes the distortion of the world.</p>



<p>The only thing I blame myself for is the fact that I somehow find myself agreeing with such a person.</p>



<p>[You can tease me all you want, but please don&#8217;t start a rumor that Sato-san and I are dating.]</p>



<p>[Eh? Why is that? Isn&#8217;t it a matter of great congratulation to you?]</p>



<p>[Sato-san will be troubled if she heard rumours of going out a guy she doesn&#8217;t want to.]</p>



<p>It was now Ren turns to froze suddenly.</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s wrong?]</p>



<p>I came to an halt and looked at him.</p>



<p>Stopping his laughter, he looks at me as if he couldn&#8217;t believe his eyes.</p>



<p>[Eh? Are you seriously saying that? To hide your embreassment? It&#8217;s joke right?]</p>



<p>[?What are you talking about?]</p>



<p>[Iya, as expected virgin are gross.]</p>



<p>[Ha?]</p>



<p>[This is terrible for Sato-san too.]</p>



<p>[Hey! What&#8217;s terrible?]</p>



<p>[Shut up! Shut up! Shut up virgin!]</p>



<p>As I was about to shoot out virgin will not shit up, Ren abruptly stopped walking and I swallowed the word that are about to escape from my throat.</p>



<p>[We have arrived at my recommendation place.]</p>



<p>Ren laughed meaningfully and pointed to a quaint store.</p>



<p>In the midst of a crowd of old houses and compact independent stores, there was one red-painted building that stood out.</p>



<p>The sign said, &#8220;Europe Used Clothing MOON.</p>



<p>[Oh…]</p>



<p>I was surprised since I have expected to be taken to suitable chain store.</p>



<p>Is this a place I can enter?</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t feel like it but as Ren went through without any questions, I also follow him nervously.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry for intruding…….]</p>



<p>After following him, I realized again how out of place I felt, and I still regretted it.</p>



<p>First of all, there were so many clothes lined up in such a cramped space that I felt as if I had wandered into a huge closet.</p>



<p>Useless gloomy lighting, the dust dance mixed with the strong smell of incense, and the heavy bass background music coming from many directions.If I had come here as a child, I would have been traumatized for sure.</p>



<p>Even though it&#8217;s same fashionable but it&#8217;s completely opposite of the &#8220;cafe tutuji&#8221;.</p>



<p>[Amazing…]</p>



<p>Overwhelmed, I let out such voice unconsciously.</p>



<p>Ren, on the other side, seemed to be accustomed was moving rapidly within the sea of clothes at the back of the store saying something like [hey, It&#8217;s not here?]</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t imitate his fearlessness. …. While I was thinking about it, I looked at the clothes nearby.</p>



<p>[Eccentric] or [brimming with exoticness] or [when to wear it] or [what&#8217;s this?Peter*n clothes?and here this shoes have hair grown….?]<br>It&#8217;s like a fantasy world.</p>



<p>As I touched the mysterious white hairs on the shoes, I felt a certain eeriness in them………</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s a 70&#8217;s Swedish military pullover long shirt, and those boots are French seal fur Tyrolean shoes, maybe a little early for you.]</p>



<p>[Uwaa!!]</p>



<p>I screamed reflexively at the sudden voice coming from behind.</p>



<p>I turned around to see a tall, slender woman dressed in an elaborately embroidered, antique denim dress.</p>



<p>[Haha, I&#8217;m sorry to surprised you, I&#8217;m the employee here.]<br>In front of me whose heart was still beating, she laughed while making a salute pose.</p>



<p>Then Ren, who heard my scream and came back to me, looked at her and said,</p>



<p>[Ah, what&#8217;s that nee-chan, you were here?] (nee-chan &#8211; his sister)</p>



<p>[Eh, ne, nee-chan?]</p>



<p>I compared the Ren and her face alternatively.</p>



<p>Hereupon, as if she found my reaction interesting, [ahahaha] she laughed out like Ren.</p>



<p>[So! I&#8217;ve heard about you from Ren! Today, I, Shizuki, who works at the MOON vintage clothing store, will turn Sota-kun into the most popular man in the world! Yappy!]</p>



<p>Yappy! In the face of an unfamiliar greeting and a strangely high-tension sister of Ren&#8217;s, I was struck by an inexplicable anxiety.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>A woman&#8217;s vanity is precious and should not be discarded lightly.</p>



<p>Keep it with you at all times and hold for the rest of your life.</p>



<p>These are not the words of some great person, but the words of my mother, Sato kiyomi.</p>



<p>By the way, [ hm, Okaa-san is a vain person isn&#8217;t it?] When I slip it out unconsciously, I was smacked hard on my head.</p>



<p>Rather than pain, I was surprised to hear my head make an unexpectedly good sound, and I almost cried. No violence.</p>



<p>Well, they were nice words, even if it did make me teary-eyed and put my mom in a bad mood.</p>



<p>A woman&#8217;s vanity is precious, and she should never give it up at any time.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;If that&#8217;s the case, it would be this time, too.</p>



<p>That night, I made a phone call I rarely make.</p>



<p>To Sudo Rinko, the girl closest to me in age among my few acquaintances.</p>



<p>[Ah, hello, koharu, what&#8217;s it……..]</p>



<p>I said it quickly before the girl on the opposite side could finish her words.</p>



<p>[I want you to help me choose an outfit for the date on Saturday.]</p>



<p>[Ugh…]</p>



<p>I heard the Rinko-chan voice from Ver far.</p>



<p>It seems she had put the phone away.</p>



<p>Sudo Rinko is Okaa-san&#8217;s little sister&#8217;s daughter, in other words cousin.</p>



<p>She has soft hair that extends to her chest, and her small, doll-like white face has confident eyes that shine like jewels.</p>



<p>Her face looks childish, like a middle school student but her<br>Strong gaze, compose looks compared to her age, monotonous fashion and then looking at her long and slender limbs, [perhaps isn&#8217;t she more adult then me?] I had such a illusion for moment.</p>



<p>By the way, she is 15 years old this year, a junior high school student, which means she is two years younger than me but……</p>



<p>[Is Koharu&#8217;s boyfriend handsome?]</p>



<p>After school, Rinko-chan who was walking next to me said it suddenly to which [wha!] I let out an voice unbefitting of a highschool girl.</p>



<p>Falling behind, as [boyfriend] three letter fall into my ear, my face turned hot.<br>[TN &#8211; Boyfriend in Japanese consist of three letter, ka-re-shi]</p>



<p>[Boy…. boyfriend! I and Oshio-kun aren&#8217;t yet like that…….]</p>



<p>[Ho~ so he is called Oshio huh]</p>



<p>[And what do you mean by still yet to?you are in highschool yet saying things like that, at this rate he will be taken by someone else because you are bad at communication koharu.]</p>



<p>[<del>~</del>~~~~]</p>



<p>Holding my lips tightly, I stared at her.</p>



<p>But Rinka-chan kept her gaze clear and deliberately pretended not to notice her gaze.</p>



<p>Unlike me, Rinko-chan is Frank, saying whatever she thought of and confident.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why perhaps my hesitant feeling are just problematic to her.</p>



<p>She is always very mean to me, regardless of the fact that I am two years older than her.</p>



<p>……Even though I&#8217;m 2 year older then her!</p>



<p>[So? In the end is he handsome, or how he looks?]</p>



<p>I shut my mouth tightly and didn&#8217;t answer.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a pitiful story because I&#8217;m confident that if I were to have a verbal contest with Rinka, I&#8217;d lose 100 out of 100 times.</p>



<p>Absolutely, [I will not say such things from my mouth], absolutely…….</p>



<p>[Not answering means you&#8217;re not confident, and you know you&#8217;re not that cool inside.]</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun is good-looking, though!]</p>



<p>[Ugh…..]</p>



<p>I was surprised how quickly she was provoked.</p>



<p>Pulling a scowl on her face, she held out her hand without a moment delay.</p>



<p>[What? what&#8217;s with that hand?]</p>



<p>[Photo,there should be atleast one right? Show me.]</p>



<p>[Wha!], I let out an strange voice again.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a highschool girl, I&#8217;m a highschool girl……….</p>



<p>[But that&#8217;s a little embrassing…..]</p>



<p>I barely said it from the opening of my thin narrow mouth.</p>



<p>Photo of Oshio-kun…….I have one though it&#8217;s only one.</p>



<p>But apparently from her behaviour, she thought I was trying to make him look good without a photo.</p>



<p>[Ha<del>~</del>~~~] Rinko-chan Lt out a deep sigh.</p>



<p>[Koharu, are you really a highschool girl? Atleast show that much.]</p>



<p>[Because on that photo, Oshio-kun is cool but I ….probably….am not looking…..good.]</p>



<p>[Cheeky]</p>



<p>[Ah!? Aaaaaaa!?]</p>



<p>The phone that was in my hand was snatched from me in a blindingly fast motion.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


		
<p>My smartphone doesn&#8217;t have a lock.</p>



<p>This is because of the bitter experience when I first got this phone, I forgot the passcode and couldn&#8217;t unlock it, so I had to tearfully clung to my mother.</p>



<p>Normally, [it&#8217;s really convenient to open the smartphone right away], I used to think carefree like that but this time it backfired.</p>



<p>I reflexively tried to take it back, but the quick movements of the current basketball team dodged it, and I, being a devastatingly unathletic person, fell forward.</p>



<p>I almost fell on my face, and while I was trying to calm my thumping heart, Rinko-chan took control of my phone with a familiar hand and found the photo.</p>



<p>The photo I and Oshio-kun took together at the Cafe tutuji on the night of that day,</p>



<p>[Huh? isn&#8217;t that your photo koharu, what&#8217;s with such a stiff face&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!!?]</p>



<p>[Noisy, hou~ I see, certainly this is the kind of guy you will like, however this type of gentle boy isn&#8217;t to my liking.]</p>



<p>And Yes here, saying so she returned my phone.</p>



<p>As I was so embarrassing I wanted to die, I took my smartphone and hide my blushing face with it.</p>



<p>[Ugh&#8230;..I want to hide if there is a hole..]</p>



<p>[ Too exaggerated, isn&#8217;t he a good looking man, why need to hide?]</p>



<p>I hide my inner happiness being told he is good looking even though I was bullied.</p>



<p>Then, Rinka turned around and said</p>



<p>[You were a little happy when I&nbsp; called him handsome just now, weren&#8217;t you?]</p>



<p>[Wha? How!?]</p>



<p>[You have smirk on your face]</p>



<p>As expected, I hate Rinko-chan.</p>



<p>As I was stomping around in my mind, Rinko-chan &nbsp; continued in an unusually serious face, [but you know],</p>



<p>[Koharu, Face is uselessly good, I&#8217;m a little worried]</p>



<p>[What?]</p>



<p>[ He maybe tricking you for like, Interested in your body or status, that kind of thing.]</p>



<p>[O-, Oshio-kun isn&#8217;t a person like that!]</p>



<p>[You don&#8217;t know person like them, because you&#8217;ve never been in love before, especially with a handsome man like that who&#8217;s more powerful than women.]</p>



<p>[ It&#8217;s isn&#8217;t like that&#8230;]</p>



<p>It becomes somewhat ambiguous in the end but of course I don&#8217;t doubt Oshio-kun.It&#8217;s just my complex since I&#8217;m in my second year of high school and I&#8217;ve never been in a relationship.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure Rinko-chan knows this, too.[haa&#8230;] She let out a sigh once again and then opened her mouth,</p>



<p>[Well, I don&#8217;t know all the truth but you should be aware of your inexperience in love, because when you have a crush on someone, you don&#8217;t think about it, and when the time comes, it&#8217;s too late to realize it.]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but close my mouth.</p>



<p>I was overwhelmed but more then that I was thankful for her words.</p>



<p>Earlier, I said about Rinko-chan [ perhaps isn&#8217;t she more mature then I am?], But it&#8217;s not <em>Perhaps</em>.</p>



<p>Rinko-chan is actually more mature than me.</p>



<p>[Rinko-san&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Stop calling me that, it&#8217;s gross, rather than that we are here, my recommendation.]</p>



<p>Saying so, Rinko-chan came to a halt.</p>



<p>When I looked at it, there was one very conspicuous red-painted shop among the quaint houses.</p>



<p>The sign says &#8220;Europe Used Clothing MOON&#8221;.</p>



<p>Just the sound of &#8220;Europe Used Clothing&#8221; makes me shrivel.</p>



<p>[Riri, Riri, Rinko-chan? I was expecting a more light-hearted store, but&#8230;?]</p>



<p>That much to me, who isn&#8217;t particularly obsessed with fashion, a second hand store is a high hurdle for me.</p>



<p>Be, because, second-hand clothing stores are like that, right?the ones where the scary clerks with coarse hair, beards, piercings, necklaces, and tattoos talk loudly to you&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Koharu, it&#8217;s not that way, it&#8217;s the other store in the back.]</p>



<p>[What..?]</p>



<p>As told by Rinko-chan to look there, sure enough, next to the red-painted store, there was a beautiful whitish store.</p>



<p>There was a flower bed in front of the store with lovely seasonal flowers in bloom, and the signboard said &#8220;hidamari&#8221; in pop letters.</p>



<p>The atmosphere was slightly similar to that of &#8220;cafe tutuji&#8221;. I patted my chest with relief.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m glad.]</p>



<p>[MOON is basically all men&#8217;s clothing, and it&#8217;s not always the best. I&#8217;ve rarely been there. On the other hand, &#8220;hidamari&#8221; is a general store, but they have pretty good clothes. ]</p>



<p>[Rinko-chan, do you always buy your clothes at such fashionable places&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>[I am a middle schooler, though.If I buy second hand clothes all the time, my wallet wouldn&#8217;t be able to withstand it.I usually just go to Pannys or H&amp;N. But you&#8217;re serious this time, aren&#8217;t you, Koharu?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.yes!]</p>



<p>[When I nodded vigorously, Rinko-chan smiled and opened the door of hidamari.]</p>



<p>The gentle scent of wild flowers softly tickles my nose, and I exhale.Even though it was already evening, the space was filled with the air of morning.</p>



<p>Calm bossa nova and warm indirect lighting flowing inside the store.</p>



<p>The antique clocks, overseas dolls, and humble and wonderful accessories lined up with a sense of unity make me feel nostalgic.</p>



<p>It was as if unique peculiarities of the morning &#8220;exuberance of the beginning of the day&#8221; has been locked in the space.</p>



<p>As I was fascinated by this sight,a voice was raised.</p>



<p>[Welcome, Rinko-chan]</p>



<p>As I followed the voice, I saw a woman sitting in an easy chair at the back of the store, looking through a magazine.</p>



<p>She is a very beautiful Onee-san.</p>



<p>She has softly curled medium-length black hair, a mysterious smile with a hint of melancholy, Her tight white top, pale yellow wide pants, and modest necklace glittering on her chest give her the most &#8220;mature&#8221; look.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.who might that person be?]</p>



<p>Rinko-chan pointed at me, who was standing there completely still, and said.</p>



<p>[This is my cousin, Koharu.Its quick but I need you to help me find something for her to wear, Maya-san.She have a date that I can&#8217;t lose.]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;yes, that&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m Satou koharu.]</p>



<p>I was so nervous that I gave an incoherent greeting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However the Onee-san who is called Mayo didn&#8217;t seem to mind, clapping her hands and saying in a gentle voice,</p>



<p>[Ara Ara, it&#8217;s tough isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m Nezu mayo of &#8220;Hidamari&#8221;.and I&#8217;ll do my best to coordinate.Yappy]</p>



<p>Yappy&#8230;&#8230;?</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t understand the word very well, but I assumed it was some kind of code word for fashionable people, and I hesitantly replied, &#8220;Yappy &#8230;..</p>



<p>Misoko Ren and Misoko Shizuki.</p>



<p>Those sibling&#8217;s &#8220;Oshio Souta remodeling plan&#8221; was extremely difficult.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.it&#8217;s fine.]</p>



<p>As soon as I finished changing in the small fitting room, the curtain was thrown open.</p>



<p>Behind the curtain, I saw Ren sitting on a chair with her legs crossed and Shizuku-san confidently stretching her ample chest.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san snorted and spoke up.</p>



<p>[I paired a German fisherman shirt with white work pants. The bucket hat and navy stripes are perfect for summer, and I feel marine and sporty! What do you think?]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; what&#8217;s that incantation?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what the words mean but I tried to give my honest impression,</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m wearing clothes, the silhouette is too loose, and it doesn&#8217;t fit with Sota&#8217;s slenderness.]</p>



<p>And Ren immediately criticized.</p>



<p>You are answering instead of me?No, certainly, [isn&#8217;t it good to wear them by a person with more better build?] I also thought so.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san stared at me again and [yes] and made a duck mouth expression, then she clapped her hands [certainly].</p>



<p>Then Ren stood up from his chair and handed me a set of clothes that seemed to be prepared beforehand.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s player change, Nee-chan should sit here and watch]</p>



<p>[Fu fu, so now it&#8217;s my Otouto turn to show what he has in hand for us.]</p>



<p>She sat down on a chair as a substitute and crossed her legs.</p>



<p>Whatever the replacement, aren&#8217;t I the one who is going to wear them?</p>



<p>Curtains were pulled before I could have asked the question.</p>



<p>I reluctantly changed into the clothes Ren prepared,</p>



<p>[&#8230;..It&#8217;s fine.]</p>



<p>As if waiting for me to say that, jaaan and certain was pulled with taht shout.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s a paisley collared shirt tucked into the gray slacks. The calm colors are antique and adult, perfect for Souta&#8217;s slim body, what do you think?]</p>



<p>What&#8217;s with that spell again?</p>



<p>Shizuku-san once again groaned, making a sharp mouth and said [yes].</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s a good line but a high school student can&#8217;t help but feel taller. It&#8217;s almost summer. If it were autumn, I&#8217;d give it 90 points.]</p>



<p>[Certainly]</p>



<p>Yes yes, Misono siblings nodded to each other.</p>



<p>What about my intention?</p>



<p>[You can make a difference in a casual way just by adding one military style! I love this one! French Navy border shirt!]</p>



<p>[No, if you&#8217;re going to put military in it, you&#8217;ve got to put military in the bottoms! British army cargo shorts]</p>



<p>[No, no, no! Shoes are the best in the military! They are easy to match and have excellent functionality! Italian Navy sailor shoes!]</p>



<p>No, no, no, no, many words that I have never heard are flying around with the momentum to silence even the noisy BGM that flows through the store.</p>



<p>[TN-I agree, souta, even I have a hard time figuring out all things.]</p>



<p>For some reason, the one who was left behind in all this was me, the one who was supposed to be wearing the clothes.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure he wasn&#8217;t paying attention to me, but when the discussion went in circles, Ren abruptly looked back at me and said,</p>



<p>[Souta, what do you think is good?]</p>



<p>Shizuku-san also turned her attention here.</p>



<p>How, Even if you say that, I answered while scratching my cheeks due to embreassment,</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t know much about the clothes however this is a scene where I definitely wants to looks good.]</p>



<p>The two of them shut their mouths together, as if the commotion they had just experienced was a lie.</p>



<p>Even the bass-heavy background music seemed to be coming from somewhere far away, filling the store with silence.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s an embarrassing story. I&#8217;m average at sports and study or can talk just fine but I am not that good at fashion.</p>



<p>Well, that was fine until now since it&#8217;s not like I wanted to be popular like Ren but&#8230;.]</p>



<p>And I finally said it.</p>



<p>[I just want to look good enough that the girl I like won&#8217;t get embarrassed walking together with me]</p>



<p>I feel like I&#8217;m saying very embarrassing things, but that&#8217;s my honest feeling.</p>



<p>An untouchable flower everyone envy, Satou koharu.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s vanity or pretense.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s just a moment, just like releasing the shutter. I want to stand up.</p>



<p>I wanted to be a man who doesn&#8217;t feel uncomfortable even if I take a picture of a scene where we walk side by side.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;that&#8217;s my only sincere wish.</p>



<p>Misono siblings froze for a while with their mouths opening.</p>



<p>Have they attracted too much or have I said something too gross?</p>



<p>That was when I started to think about that.</p>



<p>[Nee-chan, do you have that shirt? The beige one.]</p>



<p>[There is, Do you have a white tank top and denim pants?]</p>



<p>[Yes, a light blue, tight British ones.]</p>



<p>[What about a bag? I don&#8217;t have a good one right now.]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ve got one I don&#8217;t use.]</p>



<p>[Okay, shoes, Italian navy sailor shoes.]</p>



<p>Suddenly, as if stopped time has come to alive,, Misono siblings restlessly run inside the store.</p>



<p>While I was puzzled, the two of them quickly gathered clothes from the miscellaneous store in a brilliant coordination that made it hard to believe that they had been arguing about fashion just a moment ago.</p>



<p>In no time at all, a complete set of coordinates was assembled and handed to me.</p>



<p>[Eh? That is?]</p>



<p>[In fact, as a vintage clothing store employee, I would like to see Souta-kun wake up to the beauty of vintage clothing, but I&#8217;ll let you off the hook this time, thanks to your manly spirit.]</p>



<p>[Well if you say something so cool, I will choose seriously after all, I will play it next time.]</p>



<p>[After all you both were playing with me.]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t mess up and please change~~]</p>



<p>Then curtains were pulled vigorously.</p>



<p>I changed into the outfits they had prepared and opened the curtains, albeit a little unsettling.</p>



<p>[Oh-], A voice rises between the two.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s safely organized]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>There was a crevice running through the skinny rocky mountain.Orange lights spilled out from that crevice.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It was the cave of the Mummy&#8217;s race.</p>



<p>About thirty Mummies, men and women, lived in the back.</p>



<p>They were all wearing the same bandages.Only their eyes and mouths were free from bandages. Still, it was easy to distinguish between men and women.</p>



<p>The one with the ample bosom protruding out are the female mummies.</p>



<p>The wedding ceremony had just ended. The bride and groom were nowhere to be seen. They must have moved to another cave nearby.</p>



<p>Mimia had just talked about the Deferente she happens to come across in the daytime.</p>



<p>[That story is made up, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>The older womens laughed and chided her.</p>



<p>The mummies are frowned upon by humans, who call them dirty, tell them to stay away from them, and hurl insults at them.</p>



<p>Those who have treated them kindly are almost non-existent.</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t know anyone who will ask to be bandaged.Maybe you&#8217;re freezing in the rain and hallucinating.]</p>



<p>Mimia shook his head.</p>



<p>That man was not a hallucination.</p>



<p>The young deferente had grabbed her hand and pulled her under the tree. The warmth of his hand was not an illusion.</p>



<p>It was an unexpected kindness.</p>



<p>The knight had told her to leave.</p>



<p>It happens all the time. I guess he didn&#8217;t want to stay in the rain with the mummies. But when I was about to go back out into the rain, he stopped me. He had negotiated with the knight to let me stay in the rain</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>I was really happy because I had been running in the rain for a long time and was soaking wet.And that was the only place I could take shelter from the rain in that area. &#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>In addition, he took care of me and talked to me a lot. He even complimented me on my bandages. I was embarrassed, but I was happy.Since most humans think their bandages are dirty&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Mimia imagined the figure of that Deferente.</p>



<p>The eyes were clear. It was not the face of someone who had not studied. What did he do in the other world?</p>



<p>Royalty?I don&#8217;t know.Most of the royalty in the Kingdom of Hybride are elves. The key positions in the Spiritual Church are occupied by humans, though&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Mimir wondered if the man had already arrived at Mora&#8217;s village. Would he be in the middle of a feast right now?</p>



<p>But the people in the village have been uptight lately &#8211; especially against people coming from Solm Castle, so they might not be very welcoming.Maybe they haven&#8217;t received a warm welcome.I hope they haven&#8217;t been badly told that he&#8217;ve been kind to myself &#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s a bad joke by Deferente to put on a bandage, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>Said an older mummy woman.</p>



<p>[He isn&#8217;t that kind of person]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s a bad joke.As if he could be serious]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right. Everyone says they&#8217;re dirty and they don&#8217;t want to wear bandages. Well, they don&#8217;t know that our bandages are the best.They are strong, they don&#8217;t get hurt, and they don&#8217;t get sick.]</p>



<p>[Well,it can&#8217;t be helped since humans think of us as similar to insects afterall.when those half hearted people find those below them,they just make fun of them.]</p>



<p>Mimia was silent.</p>



<p>That human is a kind person.He wouldn&#8217;t make fun of myself.</p>



<p>Deferente are from a different world, so he definitely saw things differently than the people of this world.</p>



<p>[Would you like to see the situation in the village?]</p>



<p>One of them suggested it mischievously.</p>



<p>[Are you insane? The people in the village think we are colluding with vampires.]</p>



<p>[We&#8217;re just going and coming back. It&#8217;s nothing.]</p>



<p>[If they find you, they&#8217;ll kill you. I&#8217;m not going.]</p>



<p>The other mummy women agreed with the voice of one of them.Before long, the women dispersed.</p>



<p>Mimia was left alone.</p>



<p>The lights went out. She lay down on the bed she had made by spreading grass on the ground.</p>



<p>But&#8212;&#8212;-sleep didn&#8217;t come.</p>



<p>Her companion seems to be asleep already.</p>



<p>She wondered if that person was asleep, too.Has he been put on night watch? Maybe he&#8217;s thirsty. &#8230;.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Mimia stood up.</p>



<p>She tilted the alcohol barrel into her pottery cup.</p>



<p>A little came out.</p>



<p>She took the bandages with her and left the cave.</p>



<p>She walked straight into the woods. The stars were shining brightly in the sky.</p>



<p>Mimia began to walk briskly through the night.</p>



<p>The fort was just in a name, it was like a lookout base.</p>



<p>A stone wall stretched for tens of meters, with a watchtower in the middle of it. That was Mora&#8217;s fort which looked nothing more than a hut.</p>



<p>It might be useful to avoid a few arrows, but in a full-scale battle, the wall would be easily breached. There were some small stones scattered near the hut.</p>



<p>The person in charge of the fort was a middle-aged man named Luke.</p>



<p>[You guys keep a close watch. We&#8217;ll be sleeping.]</p>



<p>With that, he and another soldier named Gurna went to bed.</p>



<p>Hiroto and Souichiro went outside.</p>



<p>There are huge number of stars shining in the dark blue night sky.</p>



<p>Night sky is brimming with stars.</p>



<p>For a moment, Hiroto and his friend were fascinated by the number of stars.And then,</p>



<p>[Do we really stand out?]</p>



<p>They looked at each other&#8217;s shirts.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s a good target.]</p>



<p>It was Souichiro who answered.</p>



<p>They both put on crude coats made from animal skin.</p>



<p>They were asked to keep looking out but there wasn&#8217;t anything to do.</p>



<p>It was a strange sensation.</p>



<p>In the daytime, at the clubhouse of Doshinen High School, he was talking to Soichiro while being sick of the heat, but before he knew it, he was in a different world. And now he is made to look out at night.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s somehow strange but interesting.</p>



<p>He had the same feeling when he first traveled to Thailand in Elementary school.After a six-hour plane ride, he found himself in a world different from Japan.</p>



<p>The signs were written in unfamiliar Thai characters, and the language spoken was Thai. The temperature and ethnicity were also different.</p>



<p>He remembered being confused and excited.</p>



<p>(But perhaps now he was more shocked then on Thailand trip)</p>



<p>Skeleton knight walking on a town.</p>



<p>Then the Mummy race filled with bandages.</p>



<p>He wondered if that mummy girl had made it home yet.</p>



<p>He wonders if the bandages have dried up yet.</p>



<p>When he saw her for the first time, he felt sorry for the mummy girl who looked so sad when Soichirou screamed.</p>



<p>Afterwards, he noticed that she had large breasts but ――.</p>



<p>(He wondered if he could get to see her at least one more time while he is in Moras?)</p>



<p>Suddenly They both turned their heads in the direction of the horizon when they heard the eerie sound of a beast in the distance.</p>



<p>[What is it?]</p>



<p>Souichiro was frightened.</p>



<p>[Isn&#8217;t it a plane?]</p>



<p>[There&#8217;s no such thing here.]</p>



<p>Souichiro snapped at him.</p>



<p>Hiroto just smiled.</p>



<p>He tried to make him relax, but he caught on.</p>



<p>[We have come to a terrible place, haven&#8217;t we?]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s your fault. It&#8217;s your fault you made that deal.]</p>



<p>Souichiro snapped at him again.</p>



<p>[But if you complete your mission, you&#8217;ll get to meet the Archbishop.]</p>



<p>[Can you complete it? how do you plan to catch the vampire?]</p>



<p>[By asking for a favour like please get caught?]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t talk]</p>



<p>Souichiro shakes his head.</p>



<p>After that The two men fell silent. Hiroto looked up at the night sky again. He could hear the sound of someone fiddling with their smartphone next to him.</p>



<p>[As expected, it&#8217;s not connecting.]</p>



<p>Souichiro raised a helpless voice.</p>



<p>[Dammit&#8230;&#8230;..why did it have to be like that..]</p>



<p>He held his head and grumbled.</p>



<p>He must be frustrated. He must be feeling responsible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why he hit Hiroto.</p>



<p>They came to another world when he touched a piece of parchment that souichiro had bought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Souichiro must have been thinking that he is the one who caused all this.</p>



<p>Was that parchment a door to another world? Or was it a tool to summon Deferente?</p>



<p>Perhaps it was the latter.The map had HYBRIDE written on it. It must have been a map of this country on it.</p>



<p>As a result, the two of them are in a different world from the one they came from and there was no way back.But Hiroto wasn&#8217;t not feeling despair.</p>



<p>On the contrary, a corner of his mind whispered to him, &#8220;This is a good chance&#8221;.</p>



<p>This is the beginning of a fun and adventurous experience.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Thailand and Iceland are different world but could they be in more different world than this?</p>



<p>[I wonder if my parents reported it to the police&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Souichiro muttered.</p>



<p>[Yours parent might have]</p>



<p>[You are lucky since your parents are abroad,in Iceland.]</p>



<p>Hiroto&#8217;s parents are staying in Iceland.Both husband and wife are studying volcanoes together.They don&#8217;t know about Hiroto, and they&#8217;re probably not worried about him.</p>



<p>His little sister &#8211; she&#8217;s not worried about him either.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



		
<p>Oshio-kun would look good in any kind of clothes.</p>



<p>I decided this morning that I had to acquire enough feminine power to be able to say so without hesitation this morning.</p>



<p>But, but, but,</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a real thing, not a delusion or a dream, the real Oshio-kun with his casual clothes easily exceeded the hurdle I have raised all day and night!</p>



<p>If that destructive power! If that destructive power hit!!</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..so cool]</p>



<p>Unconsciously, words spilled out of my gaping mouth.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>The moment I saw her, I was struck by lightning.</p>



<p>This is a metaphor of course, but the sight of Sato-san in her casual clothes was enough of a shock to make me think that.</p>



<p>Though this is not the first time I&#8217;ve seen Sato-san in casual clothes.</p>



<p>Last Saturday, when we ate ice cream rolls together, Sato-san was wearing casual clothes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, I was more than a little shocked to see my first love in plain clothes, but I was too busy worrying about the situation at the time to even say, &#8220;You look good&#8221;.</p>



<p>I think Ren once said that no matter what kind of clothes you wear, if you can&#8217;t say &#8220;it looks good on you&#8221; with a witty line, you&#8217;re disqualified as a man.</p>



<p>I think Ren once said that no matter what kind of clothes you wear, if you can&#8217;t say [it looks good on you] with a witty line, you&#8217;re disqualified as a man.</p>



<p>But, but, but!</p>



<p>The choice of clothes was too&#8230;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230; Cute.]</p>



<p>I hurriedly closed my mouth when those words unconsciously slipped out of my mouth.</p>



<p>How can I say that line without even an introductory thing like &#8220;it looks good on you&#8221;.</p>



<p>Even if it&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s disgusting.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;ool]</p>



<p>How fortunate that it didn&#8217;t reach Sato-san ears.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Sato-san seemed to have muttered something, but unfortunately my confused mind couldn&#8217;t make out the content.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;But still, this is bad, this is bad.</p>



<p>Oshio Souta, your biggest crisis in life is still going on.</p>



<p>My heartbeat and temperature rises.The back of my head starts to heat up and I finally find it difficult to even make eye contact with her.</p>



<p>The words I had practiced so much, &#8220;You look good,&#8221; and all the clever dialogue templates I had prepared, were wiped out in a single blow.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I had no idea that there exists a fashion in this world that could enhance Sato-san&#8217;s charm to this extent</p>



<p>And I never thought that I would encounter the current Ms. Sato without any preparation at all!&nbsp;</p>



<p>After thinking about it for a while, I finally realized that I was still holding onto Mr. Sato&#8217;s wrist.</p>



<p>[&#8230;..ah!? So&#8230;.sorry.]</p>



<p>I pulled my hand away from hers as if I had been shocked, and floated a deceptive &#8220;ha ha&#8221; laugh.</p>



<p>As if to match the response, Sato-san also &#8220;ha ha&#8221; float a stiff smile again,</p>



<p>[N, No.Th, Thank you Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Hmm?</p>



<p>Sato-San?</p>



<p>Where are you looking&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.?</p>



<p>[Co, what a coincidence, what are you doing at this place?&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Why are you talking to the cracked asphalt?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And when I saw the direction of the line of sight that was no longer at the level of &#8220;diverting&#8221;, the worst thought in me passed.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to be ridiculed for my ill-fitted clothes.</p>



<p>[I thought I&#8217;d buy some clothes, so I came with Ren to the vintage clothes store right there&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>It was already a miracle that I was able to give a decent reply.</p>



<p>After all, my tension had taken a sudden turn, and I was in the depths of despair, from heaven to hell. To put it simply, I want to die&#8230;..</p>



<p>Without even turning to look here, Sato san said her words while looking toward asphalt,</p>



<p>[heh&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Is that so? what a coincidence.]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Once again, her fashion was very cute.</p>



<p>Her summary, fresh, yet cool fashion brought out the charm to the maximum in her, which was right in the middle of cute and beautiful.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not that I doubt the fashion sense of Ren and her sister, but it&#8217;s true that compared to them, no matter how much I dress up, it&#8217;s probably laughable. But it was obvious from the start.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-in that case, more so the reason it&#8217;s not time to get depressed.</p>



<p>There are words I need to say.</p>



<p>[Sato-San]</p>



<p>I called out her name with all my might.</p>



<p>Sato-San trembled her shoulders once and slowly turned to me with her hand over her mouth.Her face was flushed and her eyes were swimming.</p>



<p>[Wh, wh, what is it Oshio-kun &#8230;?]</p>



<p>I looked straight at Sato-san, smiled as usual, and said the words I had practiced so many times.</p>



<p>[You look great in those clothes, I think it&#8217;s cute.]</p>



<p>The fact that the words came out so effortlessly must have been because I really felt that way from the bottom of my heart</p>



<p>After I said it, I felt so embarrassed that I wanted to die, but I had no regrets.</p>



<p>And in response to this, Sato-san,</p>



<p>[Wha!]</p>



<p>Wha?</p>



<p>Suddenly she let out a strange sound, to which I titled my neck and somehow Sato-san collapsed on the spot.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Ah, long awaited clothes will get dirty at this rate.</p>



<p>Thinking so, I hurriedly stretched out my arm and supported Sato-san&#8217;s shoulder.</p>



<p>[uwaa&#8230;.! What&#8217;s wrong? Did you get injured earlier when you were about to fall?]</p>



<p>Concerned, I looked into her face.</p>



<p>Hereupon, her eyes looking up at me gradually started to become watery and,</p>



<p>[uwaaaaaaaaa&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;m gladdddd&#8230;&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>She started crying.</p>



<p>As I held her in my arms, she began to cry like a child, unconcerned about her surroundings.</p>



<p>[Wai&#8230;. Sato-san!?]</p>



<p>[It, it also looks too good on youuuu&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[What? No, Thank you very much&#8230;&#8230;..!? For the time being, calm down Sato-san]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on anymore, but anyway I had to keep her in the same position to pacify her until she stopped crying.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.You look cool.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a little proud of myself, despite the situation.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll buy Ren a bowl of ramen next time.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..what are you doing, koharu?]</p>



<p>I, Rinka Sudo, said with a sigh, looking at the bizarre scene unfolding outside the window.</p>



<p>Koharu, who leaves the Hidamari saying she has to pick her Okaa-san call, is currently crying outside like a child while a young man was holding her hand in front of the store.</p>



<p>Even though she couldn&#8217;t hear their voice but she has seen the whole story happening through the window.</p>



<p>And that young man, of all people</p>



<p>[He seems to be the date of Koharu-chan]</p>



<p>As Mayo-san next to me laughed and said, [Ara, Ara], I held my head in my hands on the contrary.</p>



<p>[I want to hide in a hole if there is&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Even if that&#8217;s disgraceful behaviour is from my older cousin,&nbsp;</p>



<p>I feel like a fire would come out of my face.It&#8217;s just so purely pathetic. .</p>



<p>[ Even though I thought if Mayo-san chooses clothes for her, she will have a little self confidence at least and yet&#8230;&#8230;I guess it was useless to expect KoHaru, who&#8217;s an amateur at romance, to play games.]</p>



<p>[Ara, isn&#8217;t that kind of thing also sweet and sour, the other party seems to be kind, it might work out better than you think]</p>



<p>[Who knows]</p>



<p>I said it in a deliberately suggestive tone.</p>



<p>However even if I said that in such unpleasant way, Mayo-san doesn&#8217;t frown a bit, on the contrary, she smiled and said</p>



<p>[Does Rinka-chan have no interest in things like that?]</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t]</p>



<p>I cut to the point of snapping.</p>



<p>As if Mayo-san knew the reply, [oh my] she floated out a laugh.</p>



<p>Certainly, Mayo-san must be 21 year old at the moment.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m always amazed at how mature college girls can be.</p>



<p>[Everyone is like children, completely]</p>



<p>I let out a sigh and continued.</p>



<p>[Besides, <em>It&#8217;s amazing</em>, middle schooler or highschooler too doesn&#8217;t change, no matter how much you extend your back, no one is really in love in a true sense, because in the end you don&#8217;t think about anything but yourself.]</p>



<p>I faintly muttered while looking at the crying Koharu.</p>



<p>When you have a one-sided love, you stop thinking. I repeated what I had said in my head again. After all, not everyone is in love, it&#8217;s just a one-sided love.</p>



<p>Just when I was about to chuckle to myself at how cold my thoughts were, Mayo-san &#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Pu] and spouted.</p>



<p>[Rinka-chan unexpectedly is a maiden, right?]</p>



<p>[Ha?]</p>



<p>At the reaction which was opposite of what I thought, I unconsciously raised my voice.</p>



<p>Mayo-san said so while stifling a laughter in amusing and intolerable way.</p>



<p>[Why are you laughing?]</p>



<p>[Fufu, No, I didn&#8217;t mean it in a bad way, it&#8217;s just that Rinka-chan is at an age where she needs to be.]</p>



<p>[Ugh&#8230;.. what&#8217;s with that&#8230;&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>I was afraid that if I got angry and tried to argue, I would be laughed at again, so I managed to hold back.</p>



<p>Not happy&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Fufu], I turned my back to Mayo-san who was still laughing&nbsp; and looked outside the window&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;that caught my eyes.</p>



<p>A group of people riding bicycles passed by Koharu and Oshio-kun, who seemed to have finally calmed down and were chattering away.</p>



<p>The boys were wearing their school uniforms, which they had worn down as if they were trying to show each other something, and their hair was waxed up in a random way&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. It looked familiar.</p>



<p>[That? The boys from the basketball club?]</p>



<p>Yes, They are the boys from the same basketball club.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure they were on their way home from playing somewhere after school.</p>



<p>They were passing by the road in front of the store, looking at the crying Koharu from their bicycles in a curious way.</p>



<p>Well, if a high school girl with a reasonably good face was crying in the middle of the street, they would have look at her.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>




<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



		
<p>Just when I was thinking about it, that happened.</p>



<p>One of the boys from the basketball team was driving while looking on the other side and caught his foot on one of the flowerpots in front of the hidamari store.</p>



<p>[Ah]</p>



<p>Even though I screamed, I can&#8217;t do anything else.</p>



<p>The pot, which was filled with a lovely houseplant, toppled over and rolled out into the street.</p>



<p>[&#8230;..ah, not good&#8230;..!]</p>



<p>[&#8230;.Hey, what are you doing&#8230;!]</p>



<p>[Hahaha]</p>



<p>Basketball club members&#8217; laughter arrived through the window.</p>



<p>They didn&#8217;t pick up the flower pot, but instead accelerated their bicycles as if they were trying to escape.</p>



<p>[Those guys! I ran out of &#8220;hidamari&#8221; as if I had been thrown.]</p>



<p>[Wai, wait a minute Rinka-chan, it&#8217;s alright so&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I heard Mayo-san&#8217;s voice behind me to stop but there wasn&#8217;t any way I could stop.</p>



<p>I know that! Mayo-san will not say herself but that was the one Mayo-san carefully raised up&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Just before I ran out onto the road, I caught a glimpse of Koharu and Oshio-kun looking at me with a surprised look on their faces, but there was no time to stop.</p>



<p>I swiftly picked up the flower pot that rolled on the roadway, then&#8212;-</p>



<p>[Rinka-chan!!]</p>



<p>Koharu shouted in a way that resembled the scream, I finally realised.</p>



<p>[Huh!?]</p>



<p>Sound of a loud headlight filled my vision.</p>



<p>[Lie&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>The flower pot I had picked up made a dull sound and bounced on the asphalt.</p>



<p>My body stiffens as if it were not my own, and my body temperature drops rapidly.</p>



<p>I had heard that a running lantern would appear in such situations, but it seemed that It was too sudden to be ready for the screening, as the time slowly passed, all I could think of was a stupid sentence, &#8220;What a stupid end for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>And just as the intense light was about to catch my whole body</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;tsu!!]</p>



<p>My body, which was as heavy as a stone, jumped.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I was hit but that I jumped.</p>



<p>Hugged by &#8220;Oshio-kun&#8221; who jumped from the side.</p>



<p>A strong light went away with a loud horn sound.</p>



<p>I thought I heard a man who seemed to be the driver shouting in anger from far away, but I was no longer aware of that.</p>



<p>I was now lying on my back on the opposite sidewalk, covered by him.</p>



<p>The reason why I was not injured even though I was flung away with such force was because he put his arm around the back of my head and used it as a cushion.</p>



<p>So, naturally instead of my place, &#8220;Oshio-kun&#8221; whose arm scraped off from the asphalt was now</p>



<p>[Are you ok?]</p>



<p>I gulped down at the sound of his voice.</p>



<p>He, Oshio-kun, looked down at me and asked.</p>



<p>I still hasn&#8217;t yet put together all my thought,</p>



<p>[I, I&#8217;m okay.]</p>



<p>When I answered, He smiled broadly and gently and said,</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m glad, can you stand up?]</p>



<p>He just said that and held out his hand to me.</p>



<p>It was white, thin and pale, like a girl&#8217;s, but if you looked closer you could clearly see it was a man&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>[Ye, yes&#8230;]</p>



<p>I took hold of hands that were held out to me while not knowing what&#8217;s what anymore.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;For the first time, I noticed the sorry state of his arm scraped by asphalt.</p>



<p>The blood soaked through and the thin skin curled up like lint was painful to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But as if he didn&#8217;t even seem to feel the pain in the first place&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>[Sorry,I pushed you too hard,&#8230;&#8230; you don&#8217;t feel hurt in any place right?]</p>



<p>[Eh?ah no, rather than me&#8230;&#8230;..that]</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t expect him to be worried about me, so I slurred my words, but my eyes were glued to his arm.</p>



<p>[Uwaa, that&#8217;s gross&#8230;&#8230;..Oh, but it&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s not as painful as it looks.]</p>



<p>Saying so, He smiled at me.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no way it wouldn&#8217;t hurt, it&#8217;s also good at bluffing.</p>



<p>In truth he must not have leeway to care about other person but he smile just to reassure me&#8212;-</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;Rinka-channn!]</p>



<p>[Waah!]</p>



<p>I was suddenly embraced from behind.</p>



<p>When I looked in panic, koharu was pushing her drenched face on my back.</p>



<p>[Sorry, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I was too scared to move&#8230;. I&#8217;m so gladdddd&#8230;. Thank you Ojio gun]</p>



<p>[T/N &#8211; well here I&#8217;m not sure since I couldn&#8217;t find the meaning of those words but looking from the flow, most likely incongruous way of speaking as she is crying]</p>



<p>[No, wait&#8230;&#8230;. Koharu! Rather than me, He&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;-I&#8217;m really glad, you also didn&#8217;t get hurt]</p>



<p>He cut between my words.</p>



<p>When I looked at him with surprise, he smiled while hiding his right arm secretly as if there wasn&#8217;t anything that changed.</p>



<p>With that series of actions, I immediately understood his intentions and just as I was about to speak that he shouldn&#8217;t do it, that time&#8211;</p>



<p>[Are you both okay!?]</p>



<p>Mayo-san, who was lagging behind, hurriedly came over.</p>



<p>This is probably because Mayo-san was the only one who was able to calmly overlook the place.</p>



<p>She glanced at me to affirm I wasn&#8217;t injured and soon looked toward him.</p>



<p>While hiding his injured arm in the last moment, he just smiled and said,</p>



<p>[I am okay.]</p>



<p>When Mayo-san saw him like that, she seemed to freeze for a moment, but soon she smiled softly as usual and said</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m glad you are okay, But your face is dirty from the dust, there is a store I work at so how about you go in the back and clean yourself slightly at least?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..Thank you very much, then I will took your words]</p>



<p>[Good, then let&#8217;s go, Rinka-chan and koharu should also go]</p>



<p>[Higu&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.ugu&#8230;ye,yess&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>[Ara Ara, Koharu-chan should also return back and wash your face, ok? I will lend you the towel]</p>



<p>[T/N &#8211; Ara Ara means oh my, uh oh or something similar.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Here here&#8221;, Mayo-san slowly rubbed the head of a crying Koharu,picked up the flower pot and guided the way to Hidamari.</p>



<p>Fuzzy emotions build up in my heart.I feel like crying like a child not knowing what I should do.</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s wrong, Rinka-chan? Come here quickly.]</p>



<p>When I finally couldn&#8217;t take it anymore, I tried to complain, but Mayo-san put her face to my ear and said,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. consider his feelings too.]</p>



<p>She sweetly smiled at me.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!]</p>



<p>Mayo-san knows everything after all.</p>



<p>[Really, thank you very much Rinka-chan]</p>



<p>She looked at the flowerpot she was holding on her right hand after saying so.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8211;it&#8217;s different, that was not me,I just ran off without thinking and caused him trouble! It was my fault that Koharu&#8217;s first love was hurt so badly because of me&#8230;&#8230;.!&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;d much rather be blamed for this&#8230;&#8230;! I&#8217;d much rather be yelled at&#8230;&#8230;!</p>



<p>Even though I know it&#8217;s useless, a sob leaks out.The uncontrollable whirlpool of emotions makes me realize that I am a child, even if I try to be an adult.</p>



<p>My vision slowly blurs, and an inexplicable feeling of helplessness fills my chest, making me feel like I&#8217;m going to burst.</p>



<p>Ah, I can&#8217;t take it anymore, I&#8217;m at my limit.</p>



<p>Just then, a hand was placed on my shoulder.</p>



<p>[Ehh&#8230;&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>A beautiful hand, and when I turned around, there he was.</p>



<p>Different from earlier, he says without a hint of smile,</p>



<p>[ Was it Rinka-chan? Perhaps Sato-san imouto?Anyway, thank you for not telling Sato-san about my arm injury]</p>



<p>Receiving those words made me feel really miserable.</p>



<p>Because it&#8217;s like that? I don&#8217;t deserve to be thanked because of troubling him.</p>



<p>[N, no, it&#8217;s different, I&#8217;m really sorry, I just&#8230;.]</p>



<p>In front of his painful right arm, I couldn&#8217;t even speak properly anymore.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a mess, pathetic, pathetic&#8230;</p>



<p>At first he looked at me strangely then showed a broad smile here</p>



<p>[What do you do at the time someone does something for you?]</p>



<p>[Wha?]</p>



<p>The sudden question froze my thoughts.</p>



<p>He slowly bent down to be at eye level with me, and repeated again.</p>



<p>[What do you say when someone does something for you?]</p>



<p>His smile is strange. I don&#8217;t know why, but I feel strangely at ease when I see it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Um&#8230;&#8230;thank you very much?]</p>



<p>[Yes, you are welcome. Same here, You also helped me.]</p>



<p>[What are&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Thank you for making me look good, I never wanted to look bad in front of Sato-san.]</p>



<p>He then patted me on the head as if he were doing it to a child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it was normally, it should be a scene where one or two curse is spit out, such as [ what are you doing with rubbing dirt on my hair I have set after so much trouble, you blockhead]</p>



<p>It should&#8217;ve been like that&#8230;&#8230;even though it should have been like that&#8230;.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m going ahead&#8230;&#8230;.thank you]</p>



<p>Finally, he said this, and headed for the hidamari with Mayo leading him.In the end he didn&#8217;t break his smile even once.</p>



<p>I should have gone back to hidamari right away too, but I couldn&#8217;t move my legs.</p>



<p>Instead, I finally realized that my heart had been beating loudly for quite some time now&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Haaa&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I touched my cheek as if I had been hit.</p>



<p>I had a terrible fever.</p>



<p>[No, lie lie lie]</p>



<p>This palpitation is strange, I couldn&#8217;t think clearly and that smile wasn&#8217;t clearing away from my head.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s different, it&#8217;s different, it&#8217;s different, because&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I squat down there to calm down the palpitation of my body.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t admit it, I definitely couldn&#8217;t admit it.</p>



<p>Because&#8230;.</p>



<p>[ I am Koharu&#8217;s first love&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I felt like I couldn&#8217;t go back if I said that, so &#8220;Uhhhh!&#8221; I groaned and ruffled my hair as if to overwrite the feeling I had just experienced</p>



<p>At the time I was doing it, [Ara Ara] Mayo-san turned around and smiled at me which seemed like a hidden meaning but I couldn&#8217;t do much about that.</p>



<p>Sudou Rinka.</p>



<p>This is the first page of my unrequited love that I could never reach.</p>




<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>[well that&#8217;s, Oshio-kun can&#8217;t leave right now.]</p>



<p>As recommended by Mayo-san, I sat down on a chair in the back room of &#8220;hidamari&#8221; and waited, when I heard such a voice from the front.</p>



<p>[Eh, wh, why is that so? Perhaps Oshio-kun is injured?]</p>



<p>[That&#8230;..]</p>



<p>These were the voices of Sato-san and her cousin, Sudou Rinka-chan (which Mayo-san had told me about), and hearing the sound of their anxious voices made me nervous too.</p>



<p>But Mayo-san said it with a calm smile on her face as if to hide it.</p>



<p>[Fufu, no, no, his clothes has been torn a little due to the jump earlier therefore I&#8217;m going to stick it and so it will take time.]</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;.is that so?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I almost shouted in amazement when Mayo-san told the lie in a gentle voice smoothly, but I hurriedly closed my mouth.</p>



<p>I could hear Sato-san&#8217;s sigh of relief. On the other hand, when I see that Rinka-chan is silent, I guessed that she&#8217;s figured out what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>Apparently she is in Middle High school but surprisingly she looks more maturish.</p>



<p>I wonder if I was rude by treating her as child and patting her head&#8230;&#8230;. I felt a Peng of regret passing through my head after all that time.</p>



<p>[That being the case, you should return to your home first, it&#8217;s getting very late now.]</p>



<p>[Eh but I can wait till you finish stitching.]</p>



<p>[If you want to see Oshio-kun in his underwear so badly, do you want to go to the back room with me?]</p>



<p>[Rinka-chan let&#8217;s go back! I will send you!]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Can you convey my apology for causing all the trouble to Oshio-kun ?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;yes, I look forward for you to come to the store again.]</p>



<p>I heard Sato-san&#8217;s panicked voice, Rinka-chan&#8217;s stifled voice, and finally a somewhat absent-minded greeting, and then the sound of the door slamming shut.</p>



<p>Inside of the store turned completely silent.</p>



<p>Then, through the slightly open back room door, Mayo popped out her head suddenly and said</p>



<p>[There she goes.]</p>



<p>And smiled at me.</p>



<p>I finally let out a sigh of relief and stared at my scrapped right arm.</p>



<p>It was fortunate that the clothes I had just bought were mostly intact, but this one was terrible.</p>



<p>It was a little better by cleaning it with water while frantically stifling the voice earlier but the blood that had bled was still a little like grain of black pebbles.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m glad I kept it out of sight so i wouldn&#8217;t be conscious.</p>



<p>[Oh my, this one is quite flashy, isn&#8217;t it? Does it hurt?]</p>



<p>[It doesn&#8217;t hurt that much but I&#8217;m not good at things like that&#8230;]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not good at grotesque thing like blood or injury from a long time.Just looking at them make me dizzy&#8230;</p>



<p>[Then the first is disinfection it, wait a min]</p>



<p>[Thank you for everything Mayo-san.]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s fine, rather I should be thanking you for jumping in to save Rinka-chan, fufu, that was cool&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Is, is that so&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Mayo-san can be considered a stunning beauty.She also have composure that&#8217;s clearly different from the highschool students, exactly like an &#8220;adult woman&#8221;.</p>



<p>I was a little flustered when she said it with such straightforwardness.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Mayo-san didn&#8217;t care about that and pulled out her first aid kit with familiar hand, picked up the cotton wool with tweezers, and soaked it in disinfectant.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ve gotten used to it because my childhood friend was always getting hurt, now take out your right hand..]</p>



<p>[Thank you for your help. &#8230;.. Ouch.]</p>



<p>The disinfectant smeared, and I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a pathetic voice.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;As I was thinking &#8220;I&#8217;m really glad Sato-san returned home first&#8221;</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun, do you like Koharu-chan?]</p>



<p>[Wh!?How do you know&#8230;.. ouch!?]</p>



<p>My heart jumped two steps in surprise and pain.</p>



<p>Mayo-san continued applying disinfectant while laughing perhaps amused my reaction.</p>



<p>[I can tell just by looking.probably Koharu-chan is the only one who doesn&#8217;t know.]</p>



<p>[I, I see&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Should I be embarrassed or should I be in pain?</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..No, It&#8217;s overwhelming embrassing after all.is my behaviour really that balant?</p>



<p>[Because Koharu-chan, you see is a natural airhead]</p>



<p>[I already know this but&#8230;..haa, I&#8217;m relieved, on but also disappointed]</p>



<p>[Disappointed?]</p>



<p>[Because I was not even that much conscious of it, even if I get a level of favor that other people would notice, I wouldn&#8217;t notice it.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I closed my eyes, not really wanting to look at my own wounds, but suddenly the cotton wool that was systematically rubbing on my arms stopped.</p>



<p>When I opened my half closed eyes, I found that Mayo-san was staring at me and had stopped moving, as if she had been put on pause</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.?is something wrong?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.. that&#8217;s surprising, I wonder if it&#8217;s aiming for long shot win, Rinka-chan&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Yes?]</p>



<p>[No, you know, isn&#8217;t it humanity that you want to support the disadvantaged?]</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>[Speaking of it, you also have a little fault there.]</p>



<p>[Seriously, what are you talking abo&#8230;.ouch]</p>



<p>Cotton wool bounced at my arms at tremendous speed.</p>



<p>Wai..it hurts, its hurts, it hurts, Mayo-san!?</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun, Frankly what do you think of Rinka-chan?]</p>



<p>[Ha?why are we&#8230;.ouch, ouch, ouch]</p>



<p>[Is she cute of not?]</p>



<p>[Gee, gee &#8230;.! I think it&#8217;s cute &#8230;? &#8230;. that&#8217;s why a little&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>Please stop.I twist my body to indicate that but she has no sign of stopping]</p>



<p>In fact, the cotton is even more accelerated, no longer just pomping, but po, po, po, po, po, po.</p>



<p>And then for some reason Mayo-san eyes sparkle and she asked again&#8230;.</p>



<p>[And then,and then? What point do you think is cute?]</p>



<p>[Gah&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Incomprehensible question and yet Cotton swab continued to bounce on the wound.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on here anymore.</p>



<p>However, as I was silent and there was no sign of being released, I managed to dig up a memory of her appearance from her head, which was paralyzed by her pain.</p>



<p>Sudou Rinka, the part of her appearance that left biggest impression is&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Hairstyle!!!, Her hairstyle is cute!]</p>



<p>I shouted, almost like a scream, and Mayo finally stopped her hand there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on the silence, unpleasant sweat burst out and my breath turned rough.</p>



<p>Sa&#8230;was I saved?</p>



<p>[&#8230;..Yes, that&#8217;s it. Just bandage it up and you&#8217;ll be fine.]</p>



<p>Mayo-san let out a smile like a Buddha as if the fierce attack earlier was a lie.</p>



<p>It seems I am somehow saved.</p>



<p>I let out an oversized sigh that I would have been deflated if I were a balloon.</p>



<p>Thereupon not knowing what&#8217;s Mayo-san is thinking, in a strangely sexy gesture, she fiddles with the ends of her own hair with her fingers and says</p>



<p>[Should I also grow my hair?]</p>



<p>She asked mischievously.</p>



<p>&#8230;.Even if you say, should I?</p>



<p>[After all, it doesn&#8217;t look good if it&#8217;s not Rinka-chan?]</p>



<p>[No, it&#8217;s not that, because each person has a hairstyle that suits them&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[I see, I doesn&#8217;t suit me, huh?]</p>



<p>After saying that, Mayo-san backed off unexpectedly easily and started wrapping a bandage around my arm.</p>



<p>&#8230;..?.?.?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t really understand what adults think.</p>



<p>Just then, Hidamari&#8217;s door was suddenly thrown open with great force.</p>



<p>[&#8211;Yappei, Mayoo! It&#8217;s already 8&#8217;o clock. Close up the store! Time to close the store! It&#8217;s time for drink! It&#8217;s red wine festival today.]</p>



<p>I hear a familiar voice with an unusually high spirit.</p>



<p>When I looked at it, I somehow saw Misono Shizuku-san with a big smile on her face.</p>



<p>[That, Shizuku-san?What are you doing?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;.hm?hmmm?I thought who it was, isn&#8217;t it Souta-kun, what are you doing here or rather you still hasn&#8217;t gone home yet?Ren already returned, you know? though saying that, he just returned to 2nd floor of the Moon and what&#8217;s with that bandage?]</p>



<p>[I was overwhelmed by the torrent of questions.]</p>



<p>Shizuku-san, are you the type of person who talks more when you get excited?</p>



<p>[Oh, so Oshio-kun knew Shizuku after all.]</p>



<p>[Afterall?]</p>



<p>[Because this set of clothes is from MOON, right? You can tell by looking]</p>



<p>You can tell?&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>And this is the first time I&#8217;ve discovered this, but it&#8217;s extremely embarrassing to find out which store the clothes you&#8217;re wearing are from so easily&#8230;</p>



<p>[Shizuku-san little brother is my friend&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m Souta-kun&#8217;s best friend&#8217;s Big sister Misono Shizuku, Nice to meet you Yappei]</p>



<p>[Nice to meet you Yappei]</p>



<p>Mayo-san returns with a bodhisattva-like smile to Shizuku, who has an unusually high tension.</p>



<p>Eh,what? Is that kind of greeting popular around the clothing stores?</p>



<p>&#8230;..No,wrong.If you think normally, Both are&#8230;.</p>



<p>[We aren&#8217;t friends, Souta-kun, we are childhood friends from elementary school.]</p>



<p>[Friends, what?]</p>



<p>[We&#8217;re in the same Sweets Study Circle at university, our stores are next to each other, and because we also close the store at same time, and we often drink at Moon after work end.]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;Sweet research Club?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve heard a similar name somewhere recently, or is it just my imagination&#8230;&#8230;..?</p>



<p>When I was thinking that, Shizuku-san closes the distance with light movements as if she was performing musical steps and firmly holds my shoulder.</p>





<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



		
<p>[Well, you are lucky Souta-kun, aren&#8217;t you?you got to drink with two beautiful women, rejoice]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..What? How did you come up with the idea of a drinking party? &#8230;&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m underage.]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not cool to reject an invitation from girls! I will just toss you cola, soda or whatever you want, Now let&#8217;s go, to the opposite of Moon]</p>



<p>[Are you even sober Shizuku-san?&#8230;&#8230;Ma&#8230; Mayo-san help me&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>[I will come after finishing closing the store,so you can drink first]</p>



<p>[Wai&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[Come on handsome guy, walk briskly! Let&#8217;s talk about love, love! Even if it&#8217;s about vintage clothing.]</p>



<p>I glared at Mayo-san bitterly who just waved her hand without showing any sign of helping and I was forcibly taken to The Moon.</p>



<p>A beautiful full moon floated in the sky as if ridiculing me.</p>

<p>♦️</p>



<p>[Now then&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>In the empty hidamari, Mayo exhaled a breath of air.</p>



<p>Then&#8212;-</p>



<p>[Will Rinka-chan also come to drink?]</p>



<p>My shoulder suddenly flinched who was secretly hiding between the rows of clothes.</p>



<p>That person, just from when did she notice it?No, if it&#8217;s that person, probably she already knows about it from the beginning&#8230;</p>



<p>*Cough*</p>



<p>&nbsp;I stood up trying to look as calm as possible and lightly cleared my throat without glancing at Mayo-san.</p>



<p>[I, I will not go, I just thought of coming to properly say my thanks once again that&#8217;s why I came back&#8230;..But I don&#8217;t feel like doing it anymore, so I&#8217;m going home.]</p>



<p>[Too bad, Even though Oshio-kun is joining]</p>



<p>[It&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;It doesn&#8217;t matter]</p>



<p>[Reallyyyy?]</p>



<p>Mayo-san said with a hidden meaning.</p>



<p>I turned on my heel as my shoulders were trembling to quickly exited the store.</p>



<p>[Despite you could have asked for Mine too]</p>



<p>[It doesn&#8217;t interest me]</p>



<p>[Really? When you feel lonely at night before going to bed, you can send a casual message to your friend, isn&#8217;t it fun?.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m not interested]</p>



<p>[Rinka-chan, that hairstyle suit you]</p>



<p>That was my limit.</p>



<p>I stomped on the floor, turned to Mayo-san and said briefly,</p>



<p>[Like I said, I definitely can&#8217;t fall in love with Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>In response to that, Mayo-san laughed and said,</p>



<p>[Does Rinka-chan like Oshio-kun?]</p>



<p>[~~~~~~~~I&#8217;m sorry for intruding]</p>



<p>I closed the door a little exaggeratedly and rushed out of Hidamari.</p>



<p>Really, Really, Really! Oshio-kun kun too! Mayo-san too!!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like that! My face is hot because the weather is Humid recently! My body is trembling only because I&#8217;m afraid to be hit by a car! My heart is beating as if it&#8217;s about to burst out only because I&#8217;m running!!</p>



<p>Never, I will definitely never!</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t like I was happy that he called me cute, even though I knew that he was hopelessly in love with Koharu!</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t be ridiculous, Everyone!]</p>



<p>I ran on the moonlit road as I was absorbed in my thoughts.</p>



<p>♥️</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m home]</p>



<p>It was a little after 8:00 p.m, I opened the front door with an unconcealed good mood in my voice.</p>



<p>I could feel the presence of people in the living room.I slightly heard the sound of the TV.It&#8217;s my mother, she&#8217;s probably lying on the couch in the living room watching TV like she always does.</p>



<p>I started to take off the heels I had bought at &#8220;hidamari&#8221;, humming something I would never normally do.</p>



<p>Considering it was an item praised by Oshio-kun again, I was a little reluctant to take them off&#8230;&#8230;..well, I&#8217;ll keep them safe for the show.</p>



<p>As I was thinking about it, a familiar figure popped out from the darkness of the back hallway.</p>



<p>Well to put it simply, it was my mother.</p>



<p>[Wha!!], However, because it was too sudden, I let out an strange voice which doesn&#8217;t seems like a highschool will do due to my habit.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Koharu, Koharu]</p>



<p>My Mother called out my name in a slightly hushed voice.But I was here frantically trying to stop my thumping heart.</p>



<p>[Wha, wha, what&#8217;s the matter Mother!? You really surprised me]</p>



<p>[Why didn&#8217;t you pick up my call earlier?]</p>



<p>[Phone&#8230;..? Ah, Sorry, I was busy and forgot to call you back&#8230; Did you have something important to do?&#8230;&#8230;.or rather, why are you whispering like that?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..Hah! I really wonder who you resemble. Should I say you have bad timing or you are just unlucky&#8230;&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>[?]</p>



<p>[Anyway, I can&#8217;t back you anymore]</p>



<p>I tilted my neck at the words of My mother who I really didn&#8217;t understand what she&#8217;s trying to tell, then I realised.</p>



<p>Huh&#8230;&#8230;..?</p>



<p>Speaking of which, Mother just came out from the hallway then who was the one I sensed in the living room?</p>



<p>I listened carefully and found that the TV was playing a news program.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible that my mom, who loves variety shows, would bother to watch the news at this prime time.</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>Almost at the same time it occurred to me who it was, the door of the living room opened.</p>



<p>And when sharp eyes were exposed that emerged from the other side of the door, I, of course, and even my mother, felt like our spine was frozen.</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;Welcome back, Koharu.you are surprisingly late, aren&#8217;t you?]</p>



<p>[Fa, Father&#8230;..]</p>



<p>My father, Satou Kazuharu, was there.</p>



<p>And to make matters worse, he was not off.</p>



<p>[T/N &#8211; Nope, even I don&#8217;t know what does it mean, I thought maybe it&#8217;s about off from office but it doesn&#8217;t fit, most likely not off means not out of city for work something though that&#8217;s just a guess]</p>



<p>He had a head of hair that was blacker than black, parted seven to three, a shirt that didn&#8217;t have a single wrinkle in it, and a tightly fitted blue tie.</p>



<p>At the same time, however, deep wrinkles etched by daily hard work were protruding from the frames of his sharp, nervous-looking glasses. He was in full work mode.</p>



<p>And when my father, who usually takes a shower as soon as he gets home, is still in work mode&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s a given.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when he gives me a sermon.</p>



<p>[To, you are earlier today&#8230;..there wasn&#8217;t overtime?]</p>



<p>I tried to divert the conversation with an amiable smile on my face, but my father still wore the same scowl on his face&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m asking why you&#8217;re home so late. And it&#8217;s after school, isn&#8217;t it? Why are you wearing plain clothes? What happened to your uniform?]</p>



<p>I felt a trickle of sweat run down my neck as he questioned me so matter-of-factly.</p>



<p>Even though I knew it was my own parents, they scared me more than the teacher. I wonder if my father&#8217;s subordinates endure this kind of thing every day&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>I forced my thirsty throat open and managed to answer.</p>



<p>[I went to buy clothes with cousin Rinka-chan after school today&#8230;..since I liked them, I changed there&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Only you two children are going out for so late? And if i don&#8217;t remember wrong, isn&#8217;t Rinka-chan still in 3rd year of middle school?]</p>



<p>[Ye, yes&#8230;&#8230;..you are right&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t make eye contact with my father.</p>



<p>Even though my mind understands that the man in front of me is my own father and that he hasn&#8217;t done anything special to me in the past, my body just won&#8217;t listen to me.</p>



<p>[Come here]</p>



<p>So, when I looked down and fumbled with my mouth, my father said so and led me to the living room.</p>



<p>I obeyed with heavy footsteps.</p>



<p>At the same time, the TV news was showing a story about [a string of scandals on social networking sites and the need for morality.] There was a story of Minstagram.</p>



<p>It was about a student part-timer at a major family restaurant chain who had uploaded inappropriate and rash photos to Minstagram during the course of his duties, and how this had angered many people.</p>



<p>The father watched the TV and spat out,</p>



<p>[I&#8217;d much rather have a stray dog.]</p>



<p>He said it so coldly that it made me shudder.</p>



<p>[Koharu, you&#8217;re getting old, so let me tell you something. First of all, do you know why people get an education?]</p>



<p>At the sudden question, I timidly said,</p>



<p>[To enter into a good College&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>[No, because if you don&#8217;t get a good education, you can&#8217;t become a person in the first place.]</p>



<p>Saying that, he sat on one of the couches.</p>



<p>[Humans are only animals, always confused by their desires and easily led astray, so we need sensible adults to take the lead and educate them In the beginning. Things like Freedom and liberty, that&#8217;s the story only after one is a proper human.The young boy who appeared on the Tv is a prime example. He was a stray dog who had been released before he was disciplined properly. I&#8217;d have to say it was negligence as a parent.]</p>



<p>[After this, the boy will be fired from his part-time job and will have fingers pointed at him together with his family. The family restaurant that hired him will have a credibility problem, and the video on the Internet will never be erased&#8230;&#8230;.. Just one undisciplined stray dog can cause trouble for countless people. &#8212;&#8211; You know what I mean right?]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>In the midst of the suffocating tension, father made it clear.</p>



<p>[Koharu, you aren&#8217;t a proper human yet so don&#8217;t try to bite off the lead.]</p>



<p>Such a cold statement was nothing but a simple prelude and preaching continues.</p>



<p>After a while, I was finally released, and as I trudged to the bath, I noticed for the first time that the long hand of the clock had gone around.</p>



<p>[Haaaa~~~~]</p>



<p>My Deep, deep sigh reverberates inside the bathroom.</p>



<p>The tension that had been so high was now near its lowest.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m really tired&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I slowly sank into the bathtub.Father&#8217;s preaching drained me mentally and physically.</p>



<p>So much drama just because I was a little late&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; thought of rebellion did cross my mind for the first 10 minutes but for the remaining 50 minutes, it turned into small and small.</p>



<p>Because everything my father said was completely, completely fair.</p>



<p>Even though there wasn&#8217;t any curfew, it was my fault to come late without even informing them.</p>



<p>But, then again&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[He could have said it in a nicer tone at least&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Father is a little too strict, comparing his daughter who was at an apparent age to a dog or that she isn&#8217;t human yet!</p>



<p>However I know I couldn&#8217;t say it in this way, because I was so scared that I was on the verge of sobbing, I wish I could say it this way next time but&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I know what I&#8217;m thinking is impossible.</p>



<p>[I wish he could follow Oshio-kun example, honestly]</p>



<p>If it was him, I&#8217;m sure he would have admonished me in the gentlest possible way without hurting my delicate heart.</p>



<p>When I thought so far, I blushed when I realised I have naturally referred to &#8220;Oshio-kun&#8221; in the monologue.</p>



<p>I have been saying &#8220;Oshio-kun, Oshio-kun&#8221; a lot recently whether i was sleeping or awake, isn&#8217;t that creepy?Ah, jeez! If I continued this situation, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to live without Oshio-kun in the near future! I should forget about Oshio-kun once in a while and think about other things! Yeah, let&#8217;s do that!</p>



<p>Yes, yes, I nodded to myself and took out my waterproof smartphone I had placed in the bathtub but&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I took out but</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..I don&#8217;t know what to do.</p>



<p>[&#8230;.I want to be consoled by Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>At the words that came out from my mouth, I slammed my head into the hot water.</p>



<p>I felt like I couldn&#8217;t live without Oshio-kun any longer.I raised my head and opened up the Mine app as I was amazed at myself.</p>



<p>Then I opened the chat room with Oshio-kun, the message I have send him that day,</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you like to go together with me to drink tapioca milk after school?&#8221;</p>



<p>And stared at the shy Pomeranian stamp.</p>



<p>In the end, I haven&#8217;t sent a message to Oshio-kun even once after that&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>[I should send something&#8230;&#8230;!]</p>



<p>I have only looked at the chat room but my heartbeat started to thump like an alarm bell.</p>



<p>What does everyone do when they send something on the MINE to friends?</p>



<p>At any rate, I haven&#8217;t sent anyone but my mother and Rinka-chan&#8230;&#8230;.for the starting, &#8220;good evening&#8221;? Isn&#8217;t that a little too uptight?</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for your hard work&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; if I send that out of the blue, isn&#8217;t it too brazen or I am misunderstanding the sense of distance between us?</p>



<p>Or something like &#8220;Oshio-kun,I&#8217;m looking forward to the day after tomorrow&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[Date!!]</p>



<p>I once again slammed my head on the head water.</p>



<p>It was noisy as hell.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;or rather, I think this one should be better, isn&#8217;t it? &#8220;Oshio-kun kun, Thank you for Rinka-chan. I&#8217;m sorry for causing all the trouble today.&#8221; That&#8217;s the one! Something like getting consoled is impudent! First is gratitude for earlier!</p>



<p>When I was thinking about that while spitting bubbles in the bathtub, my father&#8217;s sermon passed through my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;at least Don&#8217;t mimic others and try to bite through the line&#8221;</p>



<p>With a splash, I raised my face in self mockery.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going to confess from now&#8221;</p>



<p>Hahahaha, I still laugh dryly and look back at the the screen of my smartphone,</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>There was a sense of discomfort.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;it&#8217;s an embarrassing story but I have tried to Mine Oshio-kun multiple times but just like now, I couldn&#8217;t muster up the courage to send and abandon it multiple times repeatedly that&#8217;s why Chat history with Oshio-kun is imprinted on my mind.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I noticed the change immediately.</p>



<p>Just down the Pomeranian stamp.</p>



<p>A short message was displayed there that said &#8220;Sato-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>[Huh!? A message from Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>Before I could comprehend the situation, my phone rang with a notification sound, and then.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>When I looked at the newly sent messages, I really thought my heart stopped for a moment.</p>



<p>No, it&#8217;s not perhaps, this time it definitely stopped for real.</p>



<p>Because the newly sent messages from Oshio-kun said,</p>



<p>&#8220;I like Sato-san&#8221;</p>



<p>Literally, the bathroom was filled with only the sound of water.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s probably what means forgetting yourself.</p>



<p>Forgetting the words, forgetting the breathing, a little more and I would have forgotten myself saying who am I, wouldn&#8217;t I?</p>



<p>&#8220;I like Sato-san&#8221;</p>



<p>That short line was repeatedly echoing my mind over and over and over.</p>



<p>Only my free eyes were tracing that short sentences back and forth over and over again.</p>



<p>Even though I haven&#8217;t digested it even a little, I repeatedly over and over looked at this single sentence.</p>



<p>In the midst of that, a drop fell from the ceiling and quietly hit the surface of the water, making a pop sound, which was finally the signal for water to finally break.</p>



<p>[T/N &#8211; how I wanted to add instead finally all hell loose break but I desperately controlled myself, wiping sweat.jpg]</p>



<p>[~~~~~~~~~~~hh!?]</p>



<p>I promptly cover my mouth with my right hand and let out a soundless scream.</p>



<p>Trembling of the hand holding the smartphone isn&#8217;t stopping, my whole body is burning hot.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;Not good, not good, not good, Not good, not good!?</p>



<p>What does it mean!? That, what does it really&#8230;&#8230;.mean!? Huh!? Oshio-kun, likes!? Who!?</p>



<p>No, isn&#8217;t it directly said, Sato-san!! Wait wait wait wait! I can&#8217;t understand anything! I should Calm down! Calm down! First take a deep breath&#8230;&#8230;..!</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.hikii]</p>



<p>Not good! I tried to contract my throat but a strange voice came out! I can&#8217;t even take a deep breath!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much time hasn&#8217;t passed since I have soaked in water and yet my toes have already turned red like a boiled octopus.Furthermore, my hands and feet were twisting inside the bathtub which made me look like a real octopus.</p>



<p>After all, it can&#8217;t be helped!</p>



<p>Instead it would have been strange if I were dealing with it calmly after receiving that kind of Mine! Various feelings gushed out from the depth of my earth becoming jumbled and I didn&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s what anymore!</p>



<p>Th, what does it really&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..mean!?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s, if I were to take the meaning of this sentence literally as it is, then that only means Oshio-kun like me however&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I, to Oshio-kun, it&#8217;s not, Oshio-kun, to me!</p>



<p>Ah, No! For me,I really like Oshio-kun but it&#8217;s not about that&#8230;&#8230;.anyway! It means Oshio-kun holds a favorable impression of me!</p>



<p>Then, why did Oshio-kun reveal it to me?</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s what it is supposed to be, right?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what it said&#8230;.</p>



<p>[~~~~~~~~~~~~~]</p>



<p>Unable to withstand it, I slammed my face on the hot water with great force.</p>



<p>If my mother and father were to see this scene, without doubt, they would definitely judge that as [Finally, Koharu&#8217;s head turned crazy].</p>



<p>But that much has already disappeared from my mind, mere 10 words or so have confused me.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-Don&#8217;t get excited Sato Koharu, don&#8217;t get excited, it hasn&#8217;t yet decided it is! Think, calm down and think about it&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>Perhaps, It was a coincidence but result was all right after i plunge my head inside the hot water</p>



<p>Thanks to that, only a little but I got back little margin to think.</p>



<p>Then, let&#8217;s think about it.I raised my head out of hot water with a splash.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;Possibility No 1, &#8220;Like&#8221; instead of &#8220;Love&#8221;</p>



<p>Oshio-kun definitely is a strong communicator.(strong communication power)</p>



<p>Perhaps People with good communication skills displayed Their favorites by conveying &#8220;I like you&#8221; to each other in the same way that they say &#8220;good work&#8221; or &#8220;thank you for today&#8221; to each other!</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; possible!</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Possibility No 2 &#8220;A simple typo!&#8221;</p>



<p>Maybe Oshio-kun wanted to message different kinds of greeting.While typing, different kinds of predictions pop out and miraculously, the aforementioned text forms out.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;. possible! I sometimes did that to my mother.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Possibility No 3 &#8220;Wrong target&#8221;</p>



<p>Surnames are common, I&#8217;m not the only one in class! Perhaps Oshio-kun wanted to convey his love to someone else, but mistakenly sent it to me&#8230;&#8230;..even though I said it myself, tears gradually started to swell up.</p>



<p>[Uuuuuuuuuu&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!!]</p>



<p>Inside of my head became complicated and unable to endure, I let out a groan.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


		
<p>I feel like I&#8217;m doing everything right, and I feel like I&#8217;m doing everything wrong. And, of course, I feel like I&#8217;m taking the long way around endlessly.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s think straight, more straight.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say, what if this is the &#8220;confession&#8221; of Oshio-kun as I first thought.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, what would happen then? If that&#8217;s the case,</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m happy]</p>



<p>My honest impressions spilled out of my mouth.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212; I&#8217;m happy, yes, of course I&#8217;m happy.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of miracle happened, but at that moment, Oshio-kun and I were &#8220;both in love&#8221;.</p>



<p>And since the confession was made, &#8220;then, please take care of me from now on&#8221;, that much is common sense, even I know that much who doesn&#8217;t have deep knowledge about love affairs.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.I wonder if we will now date, I and Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>The moment I said the words, my heart began to beat faster and faster.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Dating.</p>



<p>I like Oshio-kun.</p>



<p>However, for me, who was doing all my best to get along with him, going out with him is like something above the clouds and I had never really thought about it.</p>



<p>Anxiety, anticipation, uneasiness, and all sorts of unspoken emotions poured out of me, and I began to lose my way again.</p>



<p>My chest hurts, my head feels fuzzy, and I find myself staring at that one sentence for a long time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I like you, Sato-san&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder how much time has passed.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I kept staring at the display of the smartphone as if it would make a hole in it and then I noticed something.</p>



<p>[Ahh]</p>



<p>It was sudden but MINE has an already read function.</p>



<p>In other words, unlike email, if I open the talk screen and check the message, the other person will get a &#8220;read &#8221; notification.</p>



<p>This is a very rudimentary feature that I don&#8217;t need to explain.Because even I who don&#8217;t use MINE&nbsp; much know about this.</p>



<p>In short, I have forgotten myself so much that I couldn&#8217;t even understand something as simple as that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a situation where Oshio-kun was already informed that I have read the message Oshio-kun have sent&#8212;-</p>



<p>[Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!]</p>



<p>I shouted reflexively.</p>



<p>Hurriedly I compared the time the message was sent and the time on my smartphone.Six minutes had already passed since Oshio had sent me the message.</p>



<p>I was surprised that this seemingly eternal time was only six minutes, and then I immediately realized that Oshio knew that I had been staring at that message for six minutes, and I thought my heart would jump out of my mouth.</p>



<p>Not good, Not good Not good Not good!?</p>



<p>Reply, I have to reply but what! I also like Oshio-kun? No, what if I was mistaken then I&#8230;&#8230;!</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t even hold my smartphone properly anymore, and as I struggled to hold my trembling hand in place, the smartphone shuddered this time.</p>



<p>When I looked at the screen to see what was going on&#8212;&#8212;</p>



<p>&#8220;Incoming call from Oshio Souta-san&#8221;</p>



<p>[Kyahhhhh!?]</p>



<p>I shrieked.</p>



<p>And then my finger slips, and I tap the &#8220;answer&#8221; button at the bottom of the incoming call screen.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>In the room of Shizuku-san on the second floor of MOON&#8217;s residential part decorated with a sophisticated vintage interior.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s end now]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been half an hour since this meeting started.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san Sitting on the quaint leather sofa, said laconically with a glass of red wine in her hand which seems to end soon.</p>



<p>[Souta-kun is in love with that girl called Sato-san, right?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I wonder how we ended up having this conversation?</p>



<p>I sat down on the sofa across from the opposite side and sipped on an imported carbonated beverage from an unknown country. It&#8217;s non-alcoholic, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Hey! Answer us~ be a cool guy~]</p>



<p>[Wai, ouch!]</p>



<p>When I tried to exercise my right to remain silent, she kicked me in the shin with his outstretched toe.</p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t this person know word called &#8220;Human rights&#8221;.</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t you have a photo~ a photo~Show me her face!]</p>



<p>[Wait a bit, ouch, of course I will not it and it&#8217;s not like we are going out or anything]</p>



<p>[I do have one though~]</p>



<p>Mayo-san, who was sitting on the sofa alongside Shizuku-san, elegantly sipping a glass of white wine from a slender champagne glass, said in a stilted voice.</p>



<p>[ [ What? ] ]</p>



<p>Mine and Shizuku-san&#8217;s voices overlapped.</p>



<p>[Wh&#8230;.why do you have one?]</p>



<p>[I was quite proud of my coordination for Koharu-chan clothes so I took it for Hidamari&#8217;s official Minsta account]</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s right, I hadn&#8217;t thought about it that much under the circumstances, but Sato-san was at hidamari before she met me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So you&#8217;re saying that she got that murderous coordination just right before?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe Sato-san like me was preparing for Saturday&#8217;s date&#8230;..</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-I clapped my cheeks with both hands. I&#8217;m not sure what to do.</p>



<p>[Wha&#8230;..what are you doing suddenly?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;m just straightening up my disturbing thoughts]</p>



<p>[Huh&#8230;.?]</p>



<p>[Here&#8217;s the photo]</p>



<p>While this exchange was going on, Mayo was operating her phone at her own pace, placing her own phone on the glass top of the table.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san and I leaned our bodies forward and looked at the screen of our smartphones.</p>



<p>In the display was Sato-san in her casual clothes.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; she&#8217;s pretty as expected.</p>



<p>However,the fact that Sato-san is so cute that it occurs to me.</p>



<p>Mayo-san said she would upload this photo on the &#8220;Hidamari&#8221; official account later&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll crop the photo so that it doesn&#8217;t show her from the neck up, so Oshio-kun can have Koharu-chan in her casual clothes all to himself.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>This person really doesn&#8217;t know how to read someone&#8217;s mind, right?</p>



<p>[Ohh, isn&#8217;t she really pretty? Surprisingly a cool beauty]</p>



<p>[ Gap, it&#8217;s a gap. She is cute because she is a Klutz]</p>



<p>[T/N- natural airhead or a clumsy person if you don&#8217;t know]</p>



<p>[Heee&#8230;&#8230;.so, how far have you gone, souta kun?]</p>



<p>Shizuku-san asked the question with breath reeks of alcohol, narrowing her eyes.</p>



<p>[What do you mean by how far&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>[Kiss, have you kissed?]</p>



<p>Shizuku-san said, pursuing her lips.</p>



<p>[&#8230;I haven&#8217;t]</p>



<p>[Not even the one without tongue?]</p>



<p>[Not the ones with their tongues in, not the ones without, not even the ones on cheeks.]</p>



<p>[What? Then what have you done? What&#8217;s the farthest you have gone?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;. taking a selfie together]</p>



<p>And it was almost like an accident.</p>



<p>Hearing that, Shizuku-san laughed and shrugged her shoulders Unnaturally.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m not sure how you can say you&#8217;re in love with someone like that, pseudo-ikemen kun]</p>



<p>[T/N &#8211; Ikemen &#8211; handsome guy]</p>



<p>[But I have never says that myself&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Deeply in love too. A handsome guy too.</p>



<p>No, there&#8217;s no doubt I am deeply in love with Sato-san but that was too embarrassing so I never said it.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san drunk the wine like water and slammed the empty glass on table with great force and said,</p>



<p>[Listen here, pseudo-ikemen]</p>



<p>[When you are deeply in love&#8230;&#8230;.you just don&#8217;t stop! and just keep pushing, keep pushing]</p>



<p>[A person have its respective pace]</p>



<p>[Hmmm, when you say something flimsy like this then you aren&#8217;t seriously in love!]</p>



<p>Even though I knew it was the ramblings of a drunk, I was still taken aback by his ridiculous tone.</p>



<p>I drank the carbonated drink again and slammed the bottom of the empty can on the table.</p>



<p>[If you really think about other person then you wholeheartedly made it so that they don&#8217;t get hurt or that you don&#8217;t cause trouble for them.That&#8217;s also love]</p>



<p>[Humph, who said so to not get hurt?]</p>



<p>[By who said so&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I shrunk back at an unexpected response.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san looked here with her drowsy eyes and said,</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s annoying, most of the time people are involved with each other which in itself is troublesome, noisy and also hurting them But there are a lot of people who wished for that! That&#8217;s why there are so many couples in the city! You don&#8217;t want to hurt them. &#8230;. Isn&#8217;t it you who doesn&#8217;t want to be hurt?]</p>



<p>[It&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s not like that]</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t stand it and argue with her.</p>



<p>Then Shizuku-san silently extended her palm.</p>



<p>[Then, lend me your phone]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..yes?]</p>



<p>[Hurry up]</p>



<p>Shizuku-san urged me in an insistent tone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I just couldn&#8217;t understand what she meant and tilted my head.</p>



<p>Mayo-san also tilts her head as she doesn&#8217;t seem to understand Shizuku-san&#8217;s intentions.</p>



<p>[Hurry up]</p>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s what drunks do anyway.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s anything wrong with my phone, and to prove it, I didn&#8217;t even lock it in the first place.</p>



<p>And more importantly, I can&#8217;t let them think that I ran away.</p>



<p>[Is this okay?]</p>



<p>I hand out my smartphone to Shizuku-san.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san took the phone, operated it with a familiar hand for about 10 seconds, and then somehow put it back in her pocket.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then she picked up the bottle and started pouring the next wine into the empty glass.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Really&#8230;&#8230;.what does she even want to do?</p>



<p>While I and Mayo-san looked at her with a gaze full of doubt, the person herself however just continued drinking the wine in silence.</p>



<p>We waited for a few minutes in a strange atmosphere.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s about time]</p>



<p>Saying that abruptly, She took out my phone from her pocket and tossed it to me.</p>



<p>[Uwaaa]</p>




<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


<p>I hurriedly caught it.Safe.</p>



<p>Just what was that?</p>



<p>Her strange demeanor and inexplicable &#8220;pause&#8221; are vaguely eerie.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Holding a tinge of anxiety, I unlock my smartphone.Somehow, the MINE app that I had closed greeted me.</p>



<p>What? The next thing I knew, I saw the screen and froze, realizing what a predicament I was in.</p>



<p>[Shizuku, what have you done~?]</p>



<p>Mayo-san, who was the only one in the room who didn&#8217;t understand the seriousness of the situation, asked in a stilted tone.</p>



<p>In response to this, [Hahaha], Shizuku-san laughed in good mood and said,</p>



<p>[No, it&#8217;s not like I have done something big.it was irritating so I just sent <em>like you</em> message to the Sato-san he is in love with.]</p>



<p>*Passhin*, A moment later, a kind of loud sound echoed in the room.</p>



<p>It was only after a while that I realized that Mayo-san&#8217;s terrifyingly fast slap had struck Shizuku-san like a thunderbolt in the brain.</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s against the rule, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>



<p>Usually calm Mayo-san furiously rebuked her.</p>



<p>Shizuku-san&#8217;s shoulders shivered and Tears accumulated into her eyes , who were laughing till now in a good mood but&#8212;&#8212;-there&#8217;s not much that can be done now!</p>



<p>&#8220;I like you, Sato-san&#8221;</p>



<p>The short message that was already sent to her, and the &#8220;read&#8221; mark next to the message.</p>



<p>For a moment, my head turned blank.</p>



<p>Bad, bad, bad, what should I do!?</p>



<p>I ran out of Shizuku-san room almost in a frenzy, tapped the call button while running down the stairs, and put the phone to my ear.As soon as I left the store, I heard a pop ringing sound that went out of tune with the situation, and my mind finally went blank.</p>



<p>Although I was the one who called her, I didn&#8217;t expect Sato-san to pick up the phone so soon. No plan, no plan at all.</p>



<p>No plan, no plan at all.</p>



<p>Almost as a reflex, I shouted her name.</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;Sato-san!!]</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;Oshio-kun!!]</p>



<p>My voice and Sato-san&#8217;s on the other side of the phone overlapped.</p>



<p>The repeated unforeseen circumstances finally left me at a loss for what to say next.</p>



<p>The same seemed to be true for Sato-san, who fell silent.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>It was an uncomfortable silence that made the noise picked up by the microphone on my phone seem awfully loud.</p>



<p>My mind, which had once been so clear, started to get messy again.Unpleasant sweat runs down my face, and my spine begins to churn.All the blood flowing through my body was concentrated in my head, and I felt a slight numbness in my limbs.</p>



<p>Countless conversational simulations floated and sank, settling at the bottom of my mind.</p>



<p>My brain&#8217;s tiny tissues were just on the verge of exploding.</p>



<p>In the middle of my emotions, however, one thing was certain, I was asserting my existence.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;i don&#8217;t want to be hated.</p>



<p>I definitely don&#8217;t want to be hated by Sato-san.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..ha,haha, sorry for calling you so suddenly.had you been busy?]</p>



<p>As a result, such a vague line and forced laughter popped out of my mouth.</p>



<p>[What? &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Ah, yes, no it&#8217;s alright! completely! I was free! Hahaha&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Kind Sato-san also gave me a clumsy forced line to keep me in line.I was disgusted at my own shamelessness for having been even slightly relieved by this.</p>



<p>However, despite my feelings, my mouth spun words on its own.</p>



<p>[I, I see&#8230;&#8230;Today was a unexpected coincidence, isn&#8217;t?I never thought we would meet in such a place]</p>



<p>[Ye&#8230;..yes, I was also completely surprised.There are coincidences like that, aren&#8217;t there?]</p>



<p>[Indeed]</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahahaha&#8221;, My heart ached every time at the clumsy, forced smile&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;m currently on the call with Sato-san, aren&#8217;t I?I wonder why even though it&#8217;s a situation I should have been jumping around in happiness.</p>



<p>All those practiced words, cheesy lines too, none of them come out of my mouth.It was as if I was having a nightmare and nothing was going my way.</p>



<p>[Oh, I&#8217;m looking forward to shaved ice the day after tomorrow.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.yes.When was the last time I had shaved ice? I haven&#8217;t had shaved ice in ten years&#8230;or is that too much? Anyway, I&#8217;m looking forward to it! Hahahahaha&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>[Hahahaha]</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want to be hated.</p>



<p>This is the only feeling that is asserting itself in my head.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I don&#8217;t want to hurt you&#8230; Isn&#8217;t it you who doesn&#8217;t want to be hurt? I recalled the words of Shizuku-san.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s with every person having its pace? I don&#8217;t want to be hurt.In the end, isn&#8217;t it just like Shizuku-san said?</p>



<p>Is it because you really care about the other person that you are so careful? No, it&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m important that I&#8217;ve been avoiding conclusions in a roundabout way.It was at that time.</p>



<p>In the inevitable silence that came after we had both said our piece, I heard a strange sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An intermittent, watery sound that sounded like it was coming from behind my phone, as if it was being desperately stifled.</p>



<p>I immediately realized what it was, and felt a sudden drop in my body temperature.</p>



<p>The voice that came through my phone was that of Sato-san, a voice so faint that it seemed like it would disappear if I blew on it.</p>



<p>[Because Oshio-kun is kind&#8230;&#8230;and I know that you are kind to me and that I&#8217;m not the only one who is special&#8230;]</p>



<p>Although I wanted to say something, my throat was so tight I couldn&#8217;t speak.</p>



<p>In the first place, I can&#8217;t think about anything.</p>



<p>[Probably there might be some circumstance in the message just now, right? I&#8217;m okay, I don&#8217;t care about it&#8230;]</p>



<p>That word was the decisive blow, and my eyes went black.</p>



<p>Let alone letting out a voice, I felt like I couldn&#8217;t move at all.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..but I&#8217;m sorry.i can&#8217;t go for shaved ice&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;m really sorry]</p>



<p>Sato-san&#8217;s voice gradually became muddled to the point that she could not hide it.</p>



<p>Her words echo inside my mind which has become blank.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; I was like an empty shell.</p>



<p>In the silence, only the sound of water from my phone echoed unpleasantly.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;sorry, since it become so long.so I will cut it soon&#8230;..thank you for saving Rinka-chan today]</p>



<p>Gradually, the sound of water turned into distance voice, probably Sato-san pulled the phone from her ear.</p>



<p>Wait, somehow I don&#8217;t have the right to say those words.</p>



<p>And when I can&#8217;t hear this sound anymore, my dirty and cowardly first love will come to an end.</p>



<p>[Good night, Oshio-kun]</p>



<p>*Bam*</p>



<p>At that time, both my shoulders were grabbed with great force.</p>



<p>[!?]</p>



<p>I was brought back to reality at the unexpected shock penetrating my body completely.</p>



<p>I turned back promptly and there for some reason was Mayo-san and Shizuku-san with her face swollen up, with their hands on my shoulders.</p>



<p>Why&#8230;&#8230; before I could even ask that question, Mayo-san and Shizuku-san rapidly open and closed Their mouths.</p>



<p>Seeing the exact same mouth movements, I understand what the girls are trying to say.</p>



<p>&#8220;You like her, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;ah]</p>



<p>A moment later, words that I had heard somewhere else came back to my mind.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-Souta, muscles grow only when they hurt each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-A man&#8217;s vanity is trivial but not something to discard lightly.if he were to throw it one day, then it&#8217;s only when chasing after the woman he has fallen in love.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-if you really love someone deeply&#8230;&#8230;then you just don&#8217;t stop!</p>



<p>Suddenly I looked at the sky, it was full of stars.</p>



<p>As I gazed at them, small but surely shining, her smile flashed through my mind.</p>



<p>Her smile that day when she tasted the cheaply bought Konpeito like it was a treasured item.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;it was really sweet.thank you very much.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know how I forgot something so important.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t being nice to her because I didn&#8217;t want Sato-san to hate me.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211; it&#8217;s because I like her.</p>



<p>I like her to a hopeless point, I wanted to convey these feelings someday, isn&#8217;t that all?</p>



<p>[Sato-san]</p>



<p>*Klonk*</p>



<p>I could heard the sound of finger tapping on the display, however the call hasn&#8217;t been cut.</p>



<p>Sato-san was silent but I could tell from her long breath that&nbsp; she has once again put the phone on her ears.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;what is it, Oshio-kun?]</p>



<p>The trembling sound of her voice made my heart ache.</p>



<p>However I will no longer falter.I took in a big breath for the first time in a long time.</p>



<p>[Sato-san I want to apologise for one thing]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>On the other side of the phone, I could hear Sato-san gasp.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. No, Oshio-kun, I don&#8217;t want to hear it]</p>



<p>I could hear Sato-san&#8217;s heartbroken prayer coming from behind the phone.</p>



<p>But I didn&#8217;t mean to stop at this point.</p>



<p>Because this is already not my first love alone.</p>



<p>And for me,</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry for being so pathetic as to confess on MINE, but I&#8217;ll confess again.]</p>



<p>[What?]</p>



<p>[I like Sato-san]</p>



<p>I am not going to run away from now since I didn&#8217;t have any intention to do so.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not any kind of joke or misunderstanding or anything, I like you Sato-san. As a love interest]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


						
											
		
<p>[Wha, what&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!?]</p>



<p>Roundabout words are unnecessary, I just have to say what I feel.</p>



<p>I will surely be given the cold shoulder but that doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what Sato-san thinks but I am deeply in love with Sato-san.</p>



<p>[I have loved you since the first time we met. I&#8217;ve loved your laughing face, your angry face, your crying face, and even your face when you get a little carried away.]</p>



<p>I realized that the lid that had been holding back my emotions till now was completely gone.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m kind. I&#8217;m being nice to Sato-san is because I think of you as someone special]</p>



<p>At the same time, I also realised what I said just now.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help myself,</p>



<p>[&#8212;&#8212;-I like Sato Koharu]</p>



<p>That one word which I said with all my power, was the only thing that echoed in the slumbering night of the city.</p>



<p>I have no regrets.</p>



<p>Rather, I feel like something heavy falls that was attached to my whole body. I only have that strange refreshing feeling.</p>



<p>No matter what words came back from the other side of the phone, I was sure that I would be able to accept them now.</p>



<p>I heard something unfamiliar sound from the other side of the smartphone and then the silence came.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;*Cough*]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m confident I can accept anything but I am still nervous.</p>



<p>But, I have already confessed.</p>



<p>So I waited for her words.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..Not yet?</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s quite a long time.</p>



<p>I took the phone away from my ear and looked at the screen.</p>



<p>Hereupon, instead of the call screen, it was displaying a chat room with Sato-san and there&#8217;s a notation that says &#8220;Call time 12:02&#8221;.</p>



<p>[What!!?]</p>



<p>I reflexively shouted.</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s happened, Souta-kun?]</p>



<p>[Reply, what was the reply?]</p>



<p>Mayo-san and Shizuku-san rushed in front of me.</p>



<p>As I looked at the smartphone, I turned toward themselves and said with a quivering voice,</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.call was hung up&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>[Hey Koharu~ you have been nosiy since a while ago~ how long will you be in the bath~?]</p>



<p>[I heard the voice of my mother from changing room]</p>



<p>She seemed to be a little angry. But I didn&#8217;t respond to her, or rather I couldn&#8217;t respond.</p>



<p>Thereupon, as if she had finally lost her nerve, she put her hand on the handle of the sliding door and said&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Hey Koharu, Cut it ou ahhhhhh!!?]</p>



<p>My mother let out the loudest scream I have ever heard.</p>



<p>I was wondering why she was so surprised, but apparently my mother was surprised to see me.</p>



<p>She looked at me whose whole body dyeing completely red was slumping over the edge of the bathtub like a futon put to dry.</p>



<p>[Ah, what happened to you!!?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;..ke&#8230;&#8230;I too&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>I whispered dreamily, rolling my eyes.</p>



<p>My mother without a moment&#8217;s delay rushed up here and pulled me from the bathtub.</p>



<p>I was completely out.</p>



<p>[You stupid girl!]</p>
