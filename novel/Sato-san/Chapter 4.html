<h3>Chapter 4 : First love master</h3>




<p>Sato Koharu&#8217;s Father&#8212;&#8211; Kazuharu was looking down with icy cold eyes.</p>



<p>What he was looking at was a smartphone that was glowing faintly at the bottom of the bathtub.</p>



<p>He rolled up the sleeve of his shirt and picked up the smartphone from the bathtub.</p>



<p>He had bought it for Koharu as a gift for her entrance into high school.</p>



<p>He never in his wildest dreams thought that he would get to find out how high the waterproof performance of latest smartphone models is in this situation but anyway he stared at the display.</p>



<p>Some Kind of app chat room was opened in the smartphone.</p>



<p>Kazuharu hadn&#8217;t installed &#8220;MINE&#8221; in his smartphone but he immediately understood how it works.</p>



<p>Koharu was exchanging messages with a boy named &#8220;Oshio Souta&#8221;.</p>



<p>And the call history up until the moment before Koharu collapsed in the bathtub is still there.</p>



<p>The notorious message sent from &#8220;Oshio Souta&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I like Sato-san&#8221;</p>



<p>[Oshio, Souta&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>He put the phone to sleep, wiped the water droplets off the surface with a towel that was close at hand, and tucked it into his breast pocket.</p>



<p>And said in a thin voice,</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.Seems like Koharu isn&#8217;t ready for smartphone yet]</p>



<p>The sharp eyes peeking out from behind his glasses were as cold and wet as a blade.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>I felt the glare of the morning sun shining through the window, even through my eyelids, and I opened my eyes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;My thoughts became clearer and clearer.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s my room and I&#8217;m currently on my bed but why would I have a futon at this time of year&#8230;&#8230;.?</p>



<p>So I took a peek inside the futon and somehow I was naked.</p>



<p>[What!?]</p>



<p>I was so surprised because I didn&#8217;t have the habit of sleeping stark naked.</p>



<p>But the surprise triggered a gradual revival of my memories of yesterday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;-that&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure I fainted in the bath and then my mother dragged me out and looked after me&#8230;.</p>



<p>When I thought so far, I looked around restlessly.</p>



<p>And then I saw my smartphone on top of my study desk right next to the bed.</p>



<p>Did I bring it with me unconsciously? Or did my mother retrieve it?</p>



<p>Anyway, I wrapped my body with a poor excuse of futon and jumped onto my phone with great force.</p>



<p>If it wasn&#8217;t just a convenient dream that I had in the bath, then I was by Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>With trembling hands, I managed to wake up my smartphone from sleep mode.</p>



<p>Hereupon smartphones started up without any problem and showed it on the display.</p>



<p>There was a call history on the MINE chat room, and the message sent from Oshio, &#8220;I like Sato-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>It becomes real feelings rushing over to me.</p>



<p>My body ripples from my core and tells me. Yes, I was confessed to by Oshio-kun yesterday.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;!!]</p>



<p>I quickly clamped my mouth shut, jumped into bed, buried my face in the pillow, and screamed.</p>



<p>Of course, I was still stark naked.</p>



<p>No way, really? I, I was really by Os, Oshio-kun,&#8230;..!</p>



<p>&nbsp;His each and every word of confession revived inside my head clearly.</p>



<p>I still can&#8217;t believe that Oshio-kun confessed his love to me, but more importantly, I never thought that I would receive such a drama like confession in my whole life.</p>



<p>Even though it was through my phone, it was so close to my ear, so clearly&#8230; There was no way I could forget it! It has been deeply carved till inside of my ears!</p>



<p>[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!]</p>



<p>I pushed my own face down on the pillow and rolled around on the bed screaming.</p>



<p>Of course, stark naked.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no wonder I&#8217;m like this. Because now I remembered!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always liked you since the first time I met you.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Oshio-kun said.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know when he meant by ever since out first first meeting. However, if it really meant what I hoped he really meant then Oshio-kun and I have been in mutual love from the first time we met.</p>



<p>Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230; probably is more experienced then I am, probably not as hopeless and frazzled like I am and yet we felt the same way.</p>



<p>When I took the school entrance examination, when I was entangled by scary Onii-san and Oshio-kun helped me in the Cafe tutuji</p>



<p>When Oshio-kun taught me about how to take nice pictures in his room.</p>



<p>The time we took the selfie together, the time we had to gone to drink tapioca milk together, the time he rushed to my side when I was eating ice cream alone, all of it.</p>



<p>In all of the countless scenes that remain in my mind, Oshio-kun loved me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m already too happy about that&#8212;&#8212;-</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;No, hold on.</p>



<p>[Huh?]</p>



<p>I came to my senses and sat up quickly.</p>



<p>Oshio-kun said that he likes me and I also know that our feelings are mutual.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s good, that&#8217;s good but&#8230;..</p>



<p>[What did I say to Oshio-kun&#8217;s confession?]</p>



<p>Ahh, I hadn&#8217;t thought about my response at all.</p>



<p>I desperately twist the inside of my head to dig up yesterday&#8217;s memory.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..bad very bad.</p>



<p>Although I remember each and every word of the Oshio-kun confession, I couldn&#8217;t remember the reply I gave.</p>



<p>Because the moment I received the confession from Oshio-kun, my face became feverish, my mind went blank and I felt dizzy.</p>



<p>As I groaned, a vague memory came up.</p>



<p>a line I had uttered popped into my head.</p>



<p>ーーーーI also&#8230;&#8230; like&#8230;&#8230; Oshio-kun.</p>



<p>[I replied]</p>



<p>I&#8217;m glad, I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>[TN &#8211; Just a word Oof.i feel like facepalming here]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>If I hadn&#8217;t responded because I had gotten overheated in the bath, it wouldn&#8217;t have been a laughing matter, hahaha.</p>
<p>While in self-derision, I suddenly looked at my smartphone&#8230;..</p>
<p>My eyes were glued to the small time display on the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Oh no!</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m late]</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t matter if I confessed or not, I still had school today.</p>
<p>I hurriedly rushed out of my room.</p>
<p>After all, I was still utterly stark naked.</p>
<p>♠️</p>
<p>[Feels like the end of the world]</p>
<p>Endlessly blue sky, early summer sun was shining in the sky, Ren walking alongside with me suddenly said that.</p>
<p>What is he talking about&#8230;&#8230;.I thought, it seems like he is talking about me.</p>
<p>I see. That&#8217;s a perfectly fitting phrase.</p>
<p>I let out a deep sigh of self-mockery.</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..Of course, I just got dumped by my first love just a few hours ago&#8230;.]</p>
<p>[What, first love in second year of highschool? That&#8217;s why virgin are disgusting]</p>
<p>[Haaa&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have energy to rebut Ren&#8217;s frivolous talk.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3990" src="https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=980%2C1400&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="980" height="1400" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?w=1419&amp;ssl=1 1419w, https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=210%2C300&amp;ssl=1 210w, https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=717%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 717w, https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=768%2C1097&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=75%2C106&amp;ssl=1 75w, https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=1075%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1075w, https://i1.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/243.jpg?resize=125%2C180&amp;ssl=1 125w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Indeed, I&#8217;m disgusted.</p>
<p>Even though I made the first confession in my life with such enthusiasm, the result was that &#8230;..</p>
<p>By the way, after that event, the drinking party of Shizuku-san and Mayo-san in haste changed to &#8220;Souta-kun&#8217;s comfort party until morning&#8221;. [TN &#8211; Onee-san, souta kun and comfort ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)]</p>
<p>Mayo-san pacify me with gentle words while Shizuku-san on the other hand seems to have a wierd switch turned and apologized while crying all night, and as a result, I am now going to school alongside Ren, but even after a whole night, my heart has not healed at all.</p>
<p>I had heard rumors about people taking time off from work because of a broken heart, but I knew firsthand what that felt like now.</p>
<p>Seeing me hobbling along with a heavy gait, even Ren felt sorry for me and didn&#8217;t bother me any further.</p>
<p>The current doesn&#8217;t have enough margin to check my condition but it&#8217;s a big deal that Ren for once is reading the atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Don&#8217;t be discouraged.there are as many girls as stars after all.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;see, Ren isn&#8217;t used to comforting others but he still tried comforting me with cliched words that weren&#8217;t like Ren at all.</p>
<p>[First love not going very well, I can relate to it or not, I don&#8217;t even remember who my first love was anymore.I think it&#8217;s healthier to try different things and finally find the right one than to stick to your first love.]</p>
<p>[Is that how it is&#8230;&#8230;..?]</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s how it is. I am the who said that so no doubt]</p>
<p>Certainly, it only has persuasive power&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>[Cheer up.Next, there will be next]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; what&#8217;s next?]</p>
<p>[That&#8217; right&#8230;&#8230;How about my sister, for example! The face and style are good, and she is pretty popular at university]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;no, bad, it was disgusting what i just said now, I didn&#8217;t mean it]</p>
<p>[I was relieved]</p>
<p>I sobered up.</p>
<p>[Ah, but if it&#8217;s Mayo-san, it should be fine right? That person is definitely beautiful]</p>
<p>[Mayo-san huh&#8230;]</p>
<p>Certainly, I think she is beautiful.</p>
<p>She is mature and broad minded person&#8230;.well roughly speaking, she is a very kind person. Objectively looking, she is a very charming woman, of course I know that much.</p>
<p>[Also, She&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s friend, so you have a connection, you probably exchanged MINE last night, right?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.I did but]</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s something troubling you, you can freely consult me.saying that, Mayo-san told me her MINE ID and also followed Minsta&#8217;s account. Shizuku-san did the same.</p>
<p>[Then talk about this on MINE as consultation and also meet with my sister, then after a few times, ask her out on a private date! Look, you can see it! The victory route! I was always thinking if she was old for Souta]</p>
<p>*Ponpon*</p>
<p>Ren clapped my back with painful strength.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;well I really can&#8217;t see myself walking alongside maturish Mayo-san so I will just leave it here.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say, hypothetically, that is the winning route as Ren says, and if I do what he says, I can go out with Mayo-san.</p>
<p>But&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>[Still I would have preferred Sato-san&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>
<p>I felt guilty to be consoled by Ren, but such a pathetic comment that spilled out was my true feeling that I couldn&#8217;t help myself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, but I&#8217;ve heard that first love is almost always broken, and that everyone eventually forgets this pain and starts a new love.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s impossible now.Not even in the slightest</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s a serious illness, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>
<p>Ren whispers and tilts his head.</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;.But it&#8217;s weird, that feeling of failure, my rule of thumb is that it&#8217;s definitely&#8230;..]</p>
<p>[Stop, stop that weird consolation]</p>
<p>Mayo-san also said this last night but is it the standard phrase to say at the time of consoling a broken hearted person?</p>
<p>As I was thinking about those things&#8230;..</p>
<p>[&#8212;&#8211;Oshio-san!]</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard my name called out from behind me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a familiar voice and when I slowly turned back to see, there was&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>[Huh, Rinka-chan?]</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;Sudo Rinka, Sato-san&#8217;s cousin and a junior high school girl.</p>
<p>She seems to be terribly nervous, shaking her little head,</p>
<p>[Good morning, Rinka-chan, were you alright yesterday? There wasn&#8217;t any pain later, right?]</p>
<p>[Eh? Ah&#8230;..]</p>
<p>I was greeting her naturally, but she got defensive and stepped back a bit&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.ehh, perhaps she is on guard?</p>
<p>As I was shocked Secretly behind the smile, Rinka-chan as if deciding something,</p>
<p>[&#8212;&#8212;-Th, Thank you very much for yesterday]</p>
<p>Saying so, she bowed her head deeply.</p>
<p>[No, no.you really don&#8217;t need to mind about yesterday&#8217;s thing]</p>
<p>[But that bandage on your arm]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s not as bad as it looks, it&#8217;s just a little scraped]</p>
<p>Rinka-chan is giving my arm a worried look, as if it were her own.</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230; I&#8217;m just impressed by your righteousness, but you&#8217;re weak. &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>I hold my head in my hands, wondering what to do.Thereupon, Ren who was watching the exchange from the sideline, [really?] In a meaningful voice.</p>
<p>Ah, speaking of which, I have yet to introduce her.</p>
<p>[Ah, my bad Ren. She is Sudo Rinka-chan, cousin of Sato-san]</p>
<p>The moment I mentioned Sato-san&#8217;s name, Rinka-chan&#8217;s face stiffned all the more but I didn&#8217;t understand the true Meaning behind it.</p>
<p>But Ren, on the other hand, seemed to have noticed something and once again said, [&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; really?].</p>
<p>He coughed deliberately and said,</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m Misono Ren, Nice to meet you Rinka-chan]</p>
<p>[Please don&#8217;t call my name so casually]</p>
<p>I was so surprised at the sound of the voice that was colder than the ice.</p>
<p>Ren lips twitched a bit but he continues,</p>
<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;..then Sudo-chan, I&#8217;m sorry, but Souta&#8217;s emotional scars are more serious than his physical scars so can you come next time?]</p>
<p>[Ah, Hey Ren, what are you saying to junior high school students&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..what do you mean by emotional scars?]</p>
<p>[&#8212;&#8211;He just got dumped yesterday by his first love.]</p>
<p>[You&#8230;&#8230;!]</p>
<p>I hurriedly tried to hold Ren down, but he held his ground because he was in front of Rinka.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want junior high school student Rinka to see such a disgraceful part of a high school student.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;No, it&#8217;s embarrassing anyway!</p>
<p>Because Rinka-chan seems to be very advanced in that area.</p>
<p>[No way]</p>
<p>&#8212;-See, she is speechless!</p>
<p>Wide open eyes and holding down your lips, this is the definitely the pattern which will be followed by malicious strike of [Oshio-kun, first love in Second year of highschool, that&#8217;s why Virgin are disgusting]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..!]</p>
<p>I glared at Ren in resentment who was deliberately humming a song.</p>
<p>He suddenly pushed me out when I thought he was comforting me, if not for us being good friends, I would have broken our friendship on this spot.</p>
<p>If I was given a look of contempt from Rinka-chan, I would have him take the responsibility&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>[&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;O, Oshio-san]</p>
<p>[Huh? Ah, yes?]</p>
<p>I once again replied strangely when my name was abruptly called.</p>
<p>Looking at it, Rinka-chan clasped her smartphone with her trembling hands.</p>
<p>[W, would you like to exchange MINE with me!?]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>Why this timing?</p>
<p>Rinka-chan seems to very nervous, putting in [ah, umm] meaningless voice multiple times and then tightly shutting her eyes,</p>
<p>[I, I want to show my gratitude in a different way this time! That&#8217;s why! Mine ID&#8230;&#8230;. that&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>
<p>Strong beginning and weak ending, The only thing I could make out at the end was that his mouth was moving slowly.</p>
<p>What an upright child even though I have said it she doesn&#8217;t need to mind.</p>
<p>But well, thanking me and so on is kind of&#8230;.</p>
<p>[Mine huh, it&#8217;s fine. Let&#8217;s exchange]</p>
<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>
<p>Rinka-chan&#8217;s expression brightened visibly.</p>
<p>I wonder if she is nervous from being sandwich between two highschool students,</p>
<p>While I was thinking that, Ren from behind added,</p>
<p>[By the way, Souta also have Minsta~]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Without wasting a second, Rinka-chan bites down on the word.</p>
<p>[I… I am also using Minsta! Can I follow you?]</p>
<p>…What? I thought it would be a stormy situation, but you&#8217;re getting along well.</p>
<p>Despite the strange pressure, I and Rinka-chan exchanged MINE IDs and followed each other on Minsta.</p>
<p>A little after that, Rinka-chan bowed deeply, and,</p>
<p>[See you later!]</p>
<p>Leaving those words, she ran away quickly.</p>
<p>As I was watching her, her hair fluttering with the breeze as she disappeared into the distance, Ren murmured,</p>
<p>[…I see, surprisingly, younger people may also be possible.]</p>
<p>[Huh? Wait, you like Rinka-chan? Was it okay to exchange MINE in the flow?]</p>
<p>[Disgusting virgin.]</p>
<p>Why, and wasn&#8217;t you the one who suggested it?</p>
<p>Well, in the end, nothing is going to change.</p>
<p>Even though my first love, which I only experienced once in my life, was cruelly broken, and my mood sank to the depths of h**l, my student life continued without a hitch.</p>
<p>Classes are sleepy and boring as usual, classmates are talking about yesterday&#8217;s dramas and this week&#8217;s manga magazines like always.</p>
<p>And… &#8220;Salty Sato-san&#8221;, except that she was strangely late this morning, and was spreading her saltiness from the corner of the classroom like always.</p>
<p>One time,</p>
<p>[Hey, Sato-san, why don&#8217;t you eat lunch with me today?]</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m not in the mood.]</p>
<p>Rejected.</p>
<p>Kumita-kun from the soccer club with his usual cheerfulness and momentum leapt into making an advance on Sato-san but he was rejected so ruthlessly that his casualness felt rather painful.</p>
<p>On another occasion,</p>
<p>[Sato-san! Would you like to exchange MINE with me?]</p>
<p>[I don&#8217;t exchange contact info with someone I don&#8217;t get along with.]</p>
<p>Ruthless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only reasonable to say that Tame-kun from the shogi club who approached in a rather straightforward way by summoning his paltry amount of courage was cut down head-on.</p>
<p>Again, on another occasion,</p>
<p>[Sato-san, would also like to go Karaoke after school today?]</p>
<p>[I don&#8217;t exchange contact info with someone I don&#8217;t get along with.]</p>
<p>Ruthless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only reasonable to say that Tame-kun from the shogi club who approached in a rather straightforward way by summoning his paltry amount of courage was cut down head-on.</p>
<p>Again, on another occasion,</p>
<p>[Sato-san, would also like to go Karaoke after school today?]</p>
<p>[I dislike it.]</p>
<p>Rejected.</p>
<p>Nishikori-kun, a member of the judo club with a slightly strange sense of distance, was rejected quite simply.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s Sato-san, That &#8220;dislike&#8221; probably meant [I am bad at singing in front of other people].</p>
<p>The previous two remarks also don&#8217;t mean anything, it&#8217;s just what the word means. Just the way of saying it is a little… no, completely problematic.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime when I was watching her piling up the corpses of the boys in such a harrowing manner.</p>
<p>[Is it troubling you that much?]</p>
<p>Opposite of the desk.</p>
<p>Ren, finishing his croquette bread, said to me while clearing her both hands.</p>
<p>I hurriedly looked back and after spitting some meaningless words like [ah] and [uh].</p>
<p>[…Is it cowardly?]</p>
<p>I asked timidly. Immediately, Ren said,</p>
<p>[Cowardness, if you have even a shred of male pride left in you, don&#8217;t show it.]</p>
<p>[Is it troubling you that much?]</p>
<p>I was once again cut down by an argument and let out a sad [uh&#8230;.].</p>
<p>[It… It can&#8217;t be helped… I was all about Sato-san till yesterday, remember? Changing so suddenly…]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s a man who forces himself to switch. It&#8217;s not going to benefit anyone, so just give up, okay Sota?]</p>
<p>Ren points to me while twisting the empty package of croquette bread.</p>
<p>[You know, I don&#8217;t care what kind of mistakes people make in their love life, in fact I&#8217;d rather they make a lot of mistakes so that I have an opening to take advantage of. Love advice is the easiest way to lose a woman.]</p>
<p>[You… Are you the devil?]</p>
<p>[It doesn&#8217;t matter whether I&#8217;m the devil or not. Anyways, for the first time in my life, I&#8217;m giving you earnest advice because you are my best friend. Forget about Sato-san.]</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>Ren is sly.</p>
<p>Even though he knows that if he said it in such a way, I would be troubled. But he still said so purposely.</p>
<p>As if to stop me from making a fool of myself and deepen the wound any further…</p>
<p>[You&#8217;re kind…]</p>
<p>[And you&#8217;re welcome.]</p>
<p>Then I, in overwhelming sorrow, hesitantly began to eat my lunch, forcing Sato-san out of my mind.</p>
<p>As I repeated such a monotonous task, which was more like just carrying the food to my mouth than eating it, my thoughts began to dive deeper and deeper, and Ren&#8217;s voice became more and more distant.</p>
<p>[Well, don&#8217;t mind it too much, it was just bad luck this time.]</p>
<p>…Actually, it&#8217;s just as Ren said.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t work this time, that&#8217;s the only fact.</p>
<p>I wonder, just what went wrong?</p>
<p>Confession line, way of confession, timing, there are many things to reflect on in this period of time…</p>
<p>[The best thing about love is that it&#8217;s best not to stop. If you don&#8217;t keep crawling, you&#8217;ll soon forget how to walk.]</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s such a tricky problem in the first place.</p>
<p>Sato-san was definitely not aware of me as a person of the opposite s*x.</p>
<p>Perhaps I got too carried away after going on a date once or twice and asked for advice.</p>
<p>[…Huh? Hey, Sota, Sato-san is coming here… Hey!]</p>
<p>Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh, it&#8217;s too embarrassing. Too embarrassing…</p>
<p>What was I doing with a girl who wasn&#8217;t interested in me all this time?</p>
<p>All the lines I have said till now and my conduct so far flashes inside my mind like a revolving lantern.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to die of rage.</p>
<p>[-ta, Sota…! Hey!]</p>
<p>I&#8217;m too embarrassed to tell anyone about this, but I actually had a little bit of a silly thought in the corner of my head, &#8220;maybe Sato-san had a thing for me?&#8221; But as I thought, it was just me misunderstanding. In the end, I was the only one who got excited.</p>
<p>What else could be so embarrassing…</p>
<p>[…Oshio-kun.]</p>
<p>I was at the bottom of a deep, deep sea of thoughts.</p>
<p>With a surprisingly thin voice, she called my name and I suddenly returned to myself.</p>
<p>I looked up and saw that Ren was looking up at her, his face scrunched up.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, when I turned around… for some reason, there was Sato-san with crimson cheeks and all fidgety.</p>
<p>[Sa-Sato-san…?]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very difficult to describe in words what I was feeling at that moment.</p>
<p>It was a mess of fear of being talked to by Sato-san, who had rejected me so harshly yesterday, talking to me, and… as pathetic as it may sound, happiness from being talked to by Sato-san who had rejected me so harshly yesterday.</p>
<p>Naturally, my face scrunched up.</p>
<p>[Wh-What&#8217;s the matter, Sato-san?]</p>
<p>[That…]</p>
<p>When I mustered all my courage, Sato-san looked embarrassed, wriggling her body and mumbling.</p>
<p>[Th-This!]</p>
<p>Sato-san closed her eyes tightly and held out her smartphone.</p>    

<p>I looked at it in fear, wondering what the h**l was on it.</p>
<p>[…?!]</p>
<p>I felt as if my heart had been grabbed.</p>
<p>Because if that&#8217;s the case&#8212;&#8212;- then what&#8217;s the meaning of this, Sato Koharu&#8212;&#8212; why were the two shots from that night on the screen!</p>
<p>When I froze at the overly irregular situation, Sato-san looked somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>[This… Can I post it on Minsta!]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>A strangely cloudy voice come out. Then,</p>
<p>[Oh… Is the picture bad?]</p>
<p>Sato-san asked with upturned eyes.</p>
<p>…I wonder if I&#8217;m slightly laughing right now… Or not, when I look at the expression of Ren who has been silent since earlier, I can easily guess it&#8217;s kind of a terrible expression.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s not good after all it&#8217;s fine if Oshio-kun dislikes it…]</p>
<p>[Not…! It&#8217;s good! Yeah! If that&#8217;s what Sato-san wanted to do…]</p>
<p>[Really! I&#8217;m glad… because I heard that men aren&#8217;t good at such things.]</p>
<p>Whether she knows how I felt or not, Sato-san patted her chest in relief and finally in the end said with a faltering voice,</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m looking forward to tomorrow&#8217;s date! Then I will MINE you later.]</p>
<p>*Flop* [TN &#8211; SFX sound, like someone is flapping something]</p>
<p>Saying only that, She covered her face with the palm of her hands and ran off like a penguin.</p>
<p>Me and Ren were stiff, with our mouth open in disbelief.<br />
From the class,</p>
<p>[They are getting along well today too, aren&#8217;t they?]</p>
<p>[Oshio-kun again…]</p>
<p>[Why only Oshio-kun…]</p>
<p>There were voices like this coming half in an amazed voice and half filled with jealousy but&#8230;</p>
<p>[…Hey, Sota, that…]</p>
<p>As soon as Ren said something, I slammed my head on the desk like a broken thread powerlessly.</p>
<p>*Thump*</p>
<p>Pain comes with a dull voice. However, I still couldn&#8217;t process anything.</p>
<p>[For me, Sato-san is incomprehensible]</p>
<p>Love is a little too difficult for me to understand.</p>
<p>As I felt the pitying gaze of Ren on the back of my head, I wet my desk with my own tears.</p>
<p>♥️</p>
<p>That night, I was lying on my bed in my room, looking at my phone.</p>
<p>What was displayed on the screen was, as usual, a selfie with Oshio-kun.</p>
<p>[Ehehe…]</p>
<p>How much time has passed since I started this, I don&#8217;t remember anymore.</p>
<p>Either way, my loose mouth never tightened, and it just keeps getting looser.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can&#8217;t be helped. There&#8217;s nothing I can do about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t just a simple picture. There is a depth in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time I look at it, I can vividly remember the feeling of that moment, over and over again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I think about the fact that I was also feeling the same way as Oshio-kun at that moment, I can&#8217;t help but smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ehehehehehe…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think the current me is unpleasant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I wasn&#8217;t aware of this. Not knowing that having your first love come true is so joyful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just thinking about the future with Oshio-kun is enough to keep me awake until morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on… Yes, that of course includes tomorrow&#8217;s shaved ice date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m looking forward to it…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really, really looking forward to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tapping my feet together, I was somehow able to calm my impatient feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, it&#8217;s the first date after we both have conveyed our feelings to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Talking about a lot of things, taking pictures together… maybe something like that… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No, no, no!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I force myself to shake off my strange delusions and resume staring at my phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will dress up in my best clothes tomorrow, makeup too… I&#8217;m not very good at it, but I&#8217;ll do my best, using makeup videos from &#8220;I Tube&#8221; as references.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, this comes first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shaking off the excessive thoughts, I tapped the &#8220;Post&#8221; button on the right side of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This would upload a photo of me and Oshio from my phone to Minstagram. As I looked at the loading screen spinning around, happiness warmed my heart with warmth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been a dream of mine for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uploading a photo of myself with the person I love to Minsta, just like a normal high school girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haa, if it&#8217;s a dream I hope I never wake up…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking that, the words &#8220;Upload complete&#8221; appeared on the screen of my smartphone. Then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An incomprehensible phenomenon occured on my smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Eh? What? Why?]</span></p><div class="zetro-db4a3a315f21323bd8b387022c2a5584 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-db4a3a315f21323bd8b387022c2a5584"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I panicked and fiddled with my phone, but there was nothing I could do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, there were two knocks at my door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hiiii], I reflexively let out a short scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother would never knock on the door. This sound, without doubt…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Koharu, come out of the room immediately. I have something important to talk about.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had never felt sweat running down my neck so cold before in my life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">♠️</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Haaaaaaa…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sitting on the terrace of cafe tutuji after the restaurant had closed, with the lights faintly illuminating the place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I plopped down on the cool table and let out a deep sigh, which I already lost count of how many times I&#8217;ve had done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[How long will you be like that, cheer up…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren said while sipping the iced coffee through a straw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, he is my best friend. Albeit rotten to the core.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though &#8220;Cafe tutuji&#8221; and &#8220;MOON&#8221; are in opposite directions, he still stays with me until late hours to comfort me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m grateful for those feelings but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry but… I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m up for it yet. Thank you though, you can go home Ren.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yeah, no. I&#8217;ll have nightmares if I do.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slurping sound emanated from the straw and filled the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s quite blunt with what he says, but I can see the color of concern from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You&#8217;re overworked.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me sticking to the table like lick, my father breathed a deep sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I did say that you will grow after getting injured, but as expected that&#8217;s a little… What should I do, Sota? Should I make you a herbal tea?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t need herbal tea, the one father brews is bad.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reply. When I looked to see thinking it was a bit strange, father was taking the Most•Masculine•Pose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……? just what the h**l does it mean… No, does it even matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Everyone is amazing. You will probably forget this anguish someday, but I can&#8217;t endure it anymore, knowing that I absolutely can&#8217;t go out with the person anymore even though she is living in the same world as me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been so much easier if the screen would have gone dark with the words &#8220;GAME OVER&#8221; the moment I failed to confess my feelings to Sato-san and the whole thing would have ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, reality is different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the confession to my first love ends in failure, both Sato-san and I will go on with our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from now on, in a world where I will never be able to date Sato-san, I will continue to get along with her as a friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure that she will make many friends and even have a cool and handsome boyfriend in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m in a position to warmly watch over her as a friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not even a finger can touch her…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ugh…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gastric juice rises up and I curve my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, hey…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren immediately rubbed my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ You must have thought of something strange again! Quit it! It&#8217;ll be painful even if you just think about it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[But… I…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Calm down! Think calmly if your first love is really worth it or not! What&#8217;s with you getting carried away like this…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Carried away…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right! just watch some AV and sleep for 8 hours and you&#8217;ll be able to forget all about it! Open your smartphone, Sota! I&#8217;ll send you one I recommend on MINE right now!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Okay Ren-kun, you can&#8217;t tell Sota about that! Father will never allow it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Read the air, Muscle.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the unexpected battle between Ren and my dad, I moved my languid arms and pulled my phone out of my pocket. Then waking it from sleep mode, I saw a message notification from MINE on my home screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my eyes wide. The message on MINE was from Sato-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The message had arrived 20 minutes ago, and it was a short one liner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Help me, Oshio-kun&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sato-san…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unconsciously called out her name. Ren and Father turned to me, startled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hey, what is it this time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren called out to me, but I didn&#8217;t pay attention to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly opened the MINE application and sent Sato-san a message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean by help me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sato-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sent a few messages in succession, but they didn&#8217;t get read, let alone replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;help&#8221; here means, supposing she is currently in a critical situation right now…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my frustration grew, I couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer and called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please, pickup… Please be safe&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the phone ringing was about to reach 100 times, it&#8217;s interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8211;picked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What happened, Sato-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I did was ask if she was fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what came back from the other end of the call was not the voice of Koharu Sato.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m probably not the &#8220;Sato-san&#8221; you think I am. I&#8217;m Sato Koharu&#8217;s father, Sato Kazuharu.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice came out of the phone, surprisingly cold and intimidating enough to make me shudder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sa-Sato-san&#8217;s father…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeated the words of the man on the other side of the phone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He replied quietly but clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every word he uttered intimidated me with its obvious mass. It was the first time I experienced such a dreadful feeling just from a person&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that is irrelevant for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcibly opened my mouth…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[W-Why is Sa… Koharu-chan&#8217;s Father in a phone call…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I would rather you not call me father.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if I were to close my mouth as it is, I have a hunch that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to open it again…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Why is Kazuharu-san answering Koharu-san&#8217;s phone?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I thought it would be bad if there is something urgent, so I picked it up. If there is something urgent, I will call Koharu over but there is no need to explain the reason why. So if it isn&#8217;t urgent,  I will end the call.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completely unapproachable, but naturally I couldn&#8217;t back down either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…I don&#8217;t understand why I must use you as an intermediary in my private exchange with Koharu-san. Please explain the reason.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not wanting to be outdone by the other side, I calmly but strongly appealed my intention to protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He would cut the call here. That&#8217;s what I thought, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s because I took Koharu&#8217;s smartphone in my custody.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Don&#8217;t make me repeat twice, I have taken custody of Koharu&#8217;s smartphone.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why is it that…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s a family matter. It&#8217;s irrelevant to you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It is relevant!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the fact that the other party is Sato-san&#8217;s father… No, perhaps that&#8217;s why. I unconsciously raised my voice in response to his cold attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m Koharu-san&#8217;s friend. If you are also her father, then please explain.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment of silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of the tense atmosphere, [fuu], Kuzunoha-san exhaled a shallow sigh.</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Oshio Sota-kun, I knew your name. I have heard that you and Koharu have been on good terms lately, for which I am thankful.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Huh, wh…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[However at the same time, I also think you have done something extra by teaching her about Minstagram or something.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The word &#8220;thank you&#8221; came out of his mouth, and when I was puzzled by the disproportionate low tone of his voice, he said that next in rapid succession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnecessary thing…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…What do you mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s just what I have said, ever since Koharu started messing around with that worthless app, my schedule has been all over the place.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Worthless…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s just an app for showing off photos, a place to satisfy an adolescent&#8217;s growing need for self-approval. What else would it be if not worthless?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I listened to his spiteful words, a number of scenes popped into my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sato-san was reflecting on all the scenes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-I thought that if I became a Minstagrammer, I would be able to make some friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-I wonder if I could become a famous Minstagrammar if I practiced a little more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-Oh, Oshio-kun! This, this! How do I take a picture of this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;-Maybe I got a little carried away, uploading such a lousy picture to Minstagram and wanting to become a Minstagrammar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sato-san was trying to change her current self through Minsta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that better than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than that, the reason I was able to get along with that &#8220;Salt-god Sato-san&#8221; was all thanks to Minsta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To deny that would be to deny the hard work that Sato-san has done up until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, the message sent by her earlier, &#8220;Oshio-kun, help me&#8221; …It was now clear that he is hurting Sato-san in some way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Please take back what you just said.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For calling it &#8220;worthless&#8221; even though Sato-san was so serious about it…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost shouted that part out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seems like I was too hyper about it since I noticed father&#8217;s and Ren&#8217;s shoulders flinching from what I said..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Kazuharu-san wasn&#8217;t perturbed at all. On the contrary, he replied in an even colder tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m not going to discuss it, anyway, that&#8217;s the reason why I took Koharu&#8217;s smartphone in my custody, is that clear to you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……! However, isn&#8217;t it improper to take her smartphone-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Also, Oshio Sota-kun. It seems you had some sort of appointment with Koharu tomorrow, my bad in place of her, I have to refuse it. And before you asked me why, it&#8217;s because of the matter with her smartphone. I have prohibited Koharu from going out.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He tells me this as a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, without waiting for my question,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, then, if you don&#8217;t have any other business I will hang up.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the time it takes me to say ah, I felt him move the phone away from his ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wai……!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly tried to say something, but then I realized that I was not qualified to say anything, so I stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s all over now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the time dragged on, I had a vague premonition in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t only about the conversation with Kazuharu-san, but I had a feeling that my &#8220;first love&#8221; would be over in the true sense of the word as soon as this call ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels so painful, but at the same time I think &#8220;with this won&#8217;t I be free from this anguish?&#8221;, Such feelings gushed out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to finish it completely rather than continuing to suffer from it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will only feel pain if I stay with Sato-san any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, in the first place I was dumped by her, isn&#8217;t that? For someone like that to go into the other person&#8217;s family affairs is stupid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s none of my business, I will be a meddlesome, stalker&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I saw Ren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how much he knows, but he&#8217;s looking at me in silence, grasping his smartphone tightly and nodding slowly as if to say &#8220;that&#8217;s fine&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure he is always the most correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My first love is not worth that much, and there is no reason for me to go that far for Sato-san after being rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the best and wisest choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know this all too well. I understand it in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, still then I,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If so, please come instead of her then!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted into my phone, and at that moment, the air in the place froze.Ren and Father turned stiff, Their mouth open wide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That seems to be the case with Kazuharu-san as well, silence followed for a while and then he pulled the phone back to close his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Just now, what]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The low, cold tone of his voice made my heart tighten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s possible, if it&#8217;s possible, I would have wanted to run away right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I pushed these feelings aside and says,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Please don&#8217;t make me repeat it twice. I said if you are refusing in place of Koharu-san then it makes sense for you to come on behalf of Koharu-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Are you insane?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Perhaps I may be insane]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s just like he said, I&#8217;m sure the current me is not calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I&#8217;m about to do would be completely unreasonable and ridiculous to Ren, the master of romance, who is standing right next to me as if to say, &#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t do something stupid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why am I going to such lengths for someone who rejected me so harshly? It can&#8217;t be helped even if you say so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I will show you the thing I wanted to show to Sato-san&#8230;.no, the things Sato-san saw.Then we can leisurely discuss it over a cup of tea.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to say this as &#8220;First love Master&#8221;, then the first love is all about making mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t matter how badly you are rejected &#8212;&#8212;- you can&#8217;t help it because you love it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;.I see, that&#8217;s what it is.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san said in a plain tone and exhaled a thin sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Normally I don&#8217;t get work up on such provocations but this </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">phraseology​ was quite intelligent for a high school student&#8230;&#8230;what time and where should I need to go.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[ 7 o&#8217;clock at Cafe tutuji]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8220;Cafe tutuji&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;.Oh, that store, but doesn&#8217;t that place close in the evening?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s okay]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said firmly. I have already made up my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m looking forward to it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m not looking forward to it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, the call was cut off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The notification on the screen shows &#8220;Call time 4:17&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hard to believe that such a chilling experience had only lasted four minutes, but my attention was drawn to the sentence above it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Help me, Oshio-kun&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the spur of the moment, I launched the Minstagram app, and a picture in the new posts section caught my eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a two-shot of me and Sato-san in taken front of &#8220;cafe tutuji&#8221; that day..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; terrible photo&#8230;&#8230;..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, the photo was taken under almost accidental circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The composition is also delicate. The camera was shaking, and the face recognition system on my phone didn&#8217;t seem to be working properly, so the picture was not in perfect focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, both I and Sato-san were so nervous that we didn&#8217;t look like we were taking a selfie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I saw it, I spurted out and cried quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s with this tag&#8230;..haha, Sato-san, don&#8217;t you know how to use mintas&#8230;&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a &#8220;clink&#8221;, drop Glide through the display and trace the &#8220;My favorite photo&#8221; tag below the photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped my eyes lightly with my sleeve and turned to face Ren and my father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. your feelings haven&#8217;t changed?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Father asked worriedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad to hear that, but unfortunately, I&#8217;ve already made up my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I need your both, no, I need everyone&#8217;s help to do something. For persuading, Sato-san&#8217;s father, Kazuharu-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. you are a cool guy, you know that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren murmured.</span></p>
