<p>[TL note &#8211; Konpeito is a japanese small coloured sugar candy covered with tiny bulges.]</p>



<p>Perhaps you might not remember this but this isn&#8217;t the first time I have talked to you, Oshio-kun.</p>



<p>Of course we&#8217;re in the same class, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve at least greeted each other, but that&#8217;s not it.</p>



<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is the day when I first met you.</p>



<p>The day of the entrance exam at Sakuraba High School.</p>



<p>I was definitely the most nervous I&#8217;d ever been in my life that day.</p>



<p>I had studied as hard as I could before the day of the exam.</p>



<p>I even got approval from sensei.</p>



<p>But, to my shame,I was extremely sick, no matter how far I went.</p>



<p>During the lunch break, I couldn&#8217;t even get up from my chair.</p>



<p>I had only finished the first half of the day, but I was already at my limit.</p>



<p>I felt sick to the point of vomiting, a strange floating sensation enveloped my body.</p>



<p>I could hear the voices of everyone from the same middle school gathering for lunch far away.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have appetite for lunch.just taking one bite was enough for me to put it back.</p>



<p>Round and round and round my thoughts go.</p>



<p>I was looking down at a point on my desk, and I felt an illusion as if I was being sucked headfirst into it.</p>



<p>I know it sounds silly, but at that time I even thought I was alone in the world.</p>



<p>Help me&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>Not being able to bear anymore,I muttered quietly inside my mouth.Even though knowing no one will probably come to my rescue.</p>



<p>However at that moment, something cut into my field of vision.</p>



<p>It was a finger,slender and beautiful but definitely one that belongs to a man.</p>



<p>[Eh&#8230;]</p>



<p>Pulled back to reality,my gaze followed the hand that was so naturally held out to me.</p>



<p>I looked up and saw a junior high school boy looking down at me with a curious look on his face.</p>



<p>As soon as he saw my face, he muttered,</p>



<p>[Great complexion]</p>



<p>It annoyed me.</p>



<p>[Please leave me alone]</p>



<p>I expressed my feelings in a cold voice,not wanting to talk anymore.</p>



<p>But he kept staring at me with sleepy eyes and held out a small bag to me.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but raise my eyebrows at the sight of it.</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s this?]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s only konpeito]</p>



<p>[I understand after looking but]</p>



<p>A small bag containing konpeito.white, yellow,pink.When I see that childish color scheme, I feel like I&#8217;m being ridiculed.</p>



<p>[Want?]</p>



<p>No,it&#8217;s different,it&#8217;s not feeling anymore&#8230;&#8230;.he is definitely making fun of me.</p>



<p>[Please don&#8217;t make fun of me,I&#8217;m being serious here]</p>



<p>I say with a hint of discomfort.</p>



<p>But he still has that sleepy look in his eyes</p>



<p>[Hand,they are shivering]</p>



<p>[Uh..]</p>



<p>I withdrew my hand below the desk in panic.</p>



<p>I was so embarrassed that I tied my lips in a tight line.</p>



<p>[Does it matter to you?]</p>



<p>I made a clear statement of rejection.</p>



<p>But even then, you,</p>



<p>[Yes it does,who knows perhaps from now on we might be classmates?]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s nothing if you think about it, it&#8217;s just a natural fact.</p>



<p>But still, I was finally able to come back to reality when you said such a very natural word to me.</p>



<p>The thick blur in my head cleared up,and my vision opened up.</p>



<p>Voices of everyone and the world come back to me.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right,the people around me now are people who might be my classmates in a few months.</p>



<p>Naturally the boy in front of my eyes too.</p>



<p>I finally realized that my vision had narrowed to the point where I couldn&#8217;t see how simple it was.</p>



<p>[You know, my dad gave me this]</p>



<p>He said in a gentle tone of voice, as I froze in a daze.</p>



<p>[If your mind is tired, it seems that eating sweets will help you.well if you can’t really feel the effect, it’s still delicious though.]</p>



<p>[Can I have one?]</p>



<p>[Feel free to]</p>



<p>He opens the bag and drops a piece of konpeito on my offered hand.</p>



<p>A pink one, particularly liked by kids, rolled in my hand.</p>



<p>konpeito&#8230;&#8230;.Speaking of it,I&#8217;ve never stared at anything like this before.</p>



<p>I looked at it for a while,and then threw it into my mouth like a sparkling little star.</p>



<p>Rolling it around on my tongue is surprisingly pleasant that I can&#8217;t help but let out a smile.</p>



<p>[Isn&#8217;t it just a lump of sugar]</p>



<p>[Well that&#8217;s right]</p>



<p>He said jokingly while deliberately crushing the speckles attached to the zipper part of the bag.</p>



<p>As I watched his carefree action,the words naturally came out of my mouth.</p>



<p>[Aren&#8217;t you nervous?]</p>



<p>[Yes?]</p>



<p>[Taking exams]</p>



<p>[I think I&#8217;m nervous to a certain extent]</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t you ever think about what you&#8217;ll do if you fail?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m already thinking about it.]</p>



<p>[For example?]</p>



<p>[First,I will apologize to Tou san]</p>



<p>I rolled my eyes at the too anti climax answer.</p>



<p>[Only that?]</p>



<p>[Even then&#8230;..it&#8217;s important thing,since he is paying after all]</p>



<p>[No,I didn&#8217;t mean that&#8230;..like nervous about future or feeling like those]</p>



<p>I kneaded my fingers and tried to convey to him the anxiety I felt in my heart.</p>



<p>Hereupon,He was silent for a few moments, and then turned to me and said</p>



<p>[Well, I&#8217;ll think about it when it happens, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ll die if I fall, it&#8217;s the same for you,right?]</p>



<p>He said so while Smiling.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Oh, I&#8217;m sure you have no idea.</p>



<p>In the midst of my helpless loneliness, how much that mischievous and kind smile helped me.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s when I experienced my first love for once in my life&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>



<p>[Then,my friends are waiting for me,so good luck]</p>



<p>When I saw his profile as he was leaving after saying his goodbye, before I could even think about it,my mouth moved.</p>



<p>[Tha,that]</p>



<p>He looked back at me with a curious look.</p>



<p>In response to this, I relaxed my cheeks and smiled, which was quite awkward compared to his. &#8230;..</p>



<p>[It was really very sweet.thank you very much]</p>



<p>Exam results afterward&#8230;&#8230;..I think I don&#8217;t need to say that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all thanks to him.</p>



<p>I was too ashamed so I didn&#8217;t tell anyone, however just those several minutes of exchange cleared my mind as to why I wanted to pass that High school exam.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>Perhaps you might not remember this but this isn&#8217;t the first time I have talked to Sato-san.</p>



<p>Of course we&#8217;re in the same class, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve at least greeted each other, but that&#8217;s not it.</p>



<p>You were like an unattainable flower,not letting anyone approach you,always dealing with a clear face.of course I wasn&#8217;t an exception too.</p>



<p>Well apart from that,what I am trying to say is about the first time I met you.</p>



<p>The day of the entrance exam at Sakuraba High School.</p>



<p>you were all alone with a pale face, not moving from your desk even during the lunch break.</p>



<p>At first, I was just observing you out of curiosity, but when I saw your hands trembling slightly, I couldn&#8217;t help but called out to you unconsciously.</p>



<p>[Great complexion]</p>



<p>From there was a short exchange.</p>



<p>I knew right away that I wasn&#8217;t welcome, but I just couldn&#8217;t leave it alone.</p>



<p>So I gave it to her,a piece of konpeito.</p>



<p>A piece of konpeito, for someone who is about to enter high school.I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing.</p>



<p>But you rolled a mere grain of konpeito in your mouth like it was a treasure, and 一一一</p>



<p>[It was very sweet. Thank you very much.]</p>



<p>I hated my simplicity.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t believe that just because someone smiles at me once, I will experience my first love in life.</p>



<p>Anyway, The Exam results afterward&#8230;&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t need to say that.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all thanks to her and my simplicity.</p>



<p>At any rate, the result was all right, but I should apologize to my father.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t even thought about my dad during the second half of the exam, even though I had said those things to Sato-san.</p>



<p>The only thing that occupied my mind was a single wicked reason.</p>



<p>I want to see her smile once again.</p>



<p>This is the only reason, why I did it.</p>
