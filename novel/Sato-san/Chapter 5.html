<h3>Chapter 5: Magic</h3>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Saturday, when the thin clouds were bathed in a crimson color. I waited patiently for him at &#8220;cafe tutuji&#8221;, where the sunset warmly enveloped me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, exactly ten minutes before the appointed time &#8211; a long, white, unadorned car appeared from the other corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Here he comes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered, took a deep breath, and drank my tea in one gulp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was finally time for the decisive battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The car was parked in a simple  parking space on the gravel, separated by a string, and the driver&#8217;s door opened quietly to reveal him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a pathetic story but after all the enthusiasm, the moment I saw his figure, I was more than a little overwhelmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason was that he looked too much like an office worker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He had a shaved hairline, a wrinkle-free shirt, a blue tie, and sharp eyes like a hawk, peeking out from his sharp glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He, Sato Kazuharu, stepped down the gravel road in his polished black business shoes with a paper bag in his hand and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Just as I had promised, precisely at 7 o&#8217;clock. Now make it quick.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He walked over to the terrace seat, looked down at me, and said in an extremely cold manner. It was much more intimidating than over the phone..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That alone made me feel as if my breath would stop, but I held my ground and pointed to one of the terrace seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I will serve tea now, so please sit down here.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Before that, I have a question for you. How are you related to this store?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m an employee here, though currently off duty.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Kazuharu-san glanced at the terrace seats over there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few men and women were chatting at a table with a parasol attached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…It seems there are other customers.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, are you unhappy?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sat down on a chair and crossed his leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m not going to tell you anything you don&#8217;t want to hear. I&#8217;m just going to tell you the obvious and be done with it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…I will brew the tea.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving behind those words, I withdrew to the back of the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Stay strong, Oshio Sota.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Did you brew this?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After rolling a little bit of tea in his mouth, Kazuharu-san asked me such a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was bewildered by the abruptness of it but I calmly answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Earl grey, the one I always drink. Sa… I mean I also had Koharu-san try this.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san said so and once again put the tea cup to his mouth. Just drinking a cup of tea can be frighteningly &#8220;stylish&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He quietly put the cup down on the saucer without making a sound, and quickly got down to business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[First, let&#8217;s clarify the purpose of this discussion. Oshio Sota, what exactly do you want me to do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I want you to return the smartphone back to Koharu-san and then I want you to correct the part about Minsta being worthless which Koharu-san was so serious about. I wish you wouldn&#8217;t restrain her life so much.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Restrain, huh.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san snorted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I see, I understand your purpose. In short, you want me to return this to Koharu.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, he took out the smartphone from his chest pocket and put it on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cover was simple, like something you&#8217;d find at a 100 yen store, without any kind of decoration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unmistakably, it was Sato-san&#8217;s smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[And you want me to correct my statement, is that right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His piercing gaze met mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lukewarm breeze blew through the air between us. The sun is going to set soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…First of all, you said my education policy means </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">restraining</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> her, but that&#8217;s not how I perceive it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san said it plainly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[My daughter, Sato Koharu, is embarrassingly poor in communication skills. She is not very good at expressing her emotions, and she is not very good at assessing other people&#8217;s feelings. On the other hand, she is sensitive to the subtleties of other people&#8217;s emotions and tends to be passive, you know that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to acknowledge I understand even in front of her parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, anyway, from my point of view as a parent without favoritism, yes.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Are you trying to say that it&#8217;s not restraining but protecting?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s correct.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That-!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as blood started to rush in my head, I returned to my senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san was still looking at me with cold eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve only known him for a short time, but I know him intuitively. If I were to speak out of my emotions, he would leave the place right then and there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What&#8217;s wrong, Oshio Sota?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m dazzled by the strong western sun. It&#8217;s no longer as hot as it was during the day, but I can&#8217;t stop sweating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I have to be more firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If I have to say, taking away the phone from your daughter at her age, and then criticizing her for what she does… I wouldn&#8217;t look at it as &#8220;protecting&#8221; in a favorable light. At all.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s a fool&#8217;s errand to argue about word choice. I don&#8217;t care if you call it &#8220;control&#8221; or &#8220;restrain&#8221; or whatever. I&#8217;m talking about the essence of this conversation.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Either way, you&#8217;re wrong.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You have objections about my teaching, very well, then tell me where I am wrong.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words. It was only then that I realized that I had made a mistake by jumping into the sensitive area of education policy without prior preparation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…is not normal, no normal parent would do such a thing.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why the answer that came out of my mouth was so dull. Receiving that answer, Kazuharu-san gave me a look of contempt with unconcealed disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If there were only normal people in the world, there would be no need for educational theory in the first place, rather, educational theory would be needed for children who aren&#8217;t ordinary. Do you understand Oshio Sota?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His voice was low and quiet but filled with certain anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[These days, there are too many &#8220;Fake adults&#8221; who complain about freedom, unboundedness, and nurturing children to the point of selfishness. Adults who say that children should be left to their own devices. No, they&#8217;re just letting them go.]              </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN &#8211; for fake adults here, instead of the direct meaning of fake, the word there means -like, pseudo etc. Given the flow I just use the word fake adult instead of half or pseudo adult or adult like]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…What does it mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[They are fake adults. They&#8217;re children pretending to be adults, abandoning their parental responsibilities and not raising or protecting their children. And when things get out of hand, they just feign ignorance. What else could be so disappointing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[So you&#8217;re saying you&#8217;re fulfilling your role as a parent?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I have been saying that from the beginning.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san glared at me with his hawk-like sharp eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Peeping at his eyes, I could see the will in his eyes was as unshakable as a mountain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m Koharu&#8217;s parent and an adult. I will strongly interfere in what Koharu does, and if anything happens as a result, I will take full responsibility. It is with this determination that I am following this educational policy, what about you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What do you mean &#8220;what about you&#8221;…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My words were muddled, I was completely overwhelmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, let&#8217;s take a simple example, what if Koharu neglected her schoolwork and didn&#8217;t get into the university of her choice as a result of indulging in minstagram?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[For example, what if the pictures she uploaded on the Internet caused her to become the target of envy and jealousy, and isolated her from the rest of the class?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[There&#8217;s no end to the number of hypotheticals I can come up with! Thanks to that, There&#8217;s a good chance that it will work out!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Since you are criticizing my educational policy, let me ask you how you are going to take responsibility if things don&#8217;t go well?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way I could say that I would take responsibility lightly. The weight of those words, and the helplessness of high school students, is something I know all too well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I couldn&#8217;t help but turn my face down, Kazuharu-san said with a sigh,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Society is an unreasonable thing. You get hurt just by living. You should already be aware of it, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back on my situation of the past few days, I fell silent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I understand the argument that we grow by being hurt, but there are people who stop growing by being hurt, like Koharu. Is it wrong to want to protect such a girl?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say anything in reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I recognize how to correct those words from the bottom of my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…It&#8217;s true that Sato-san is not good at communication, and that she isn&#8217;t very strong mentally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing this, it&#8217;s too unreasonable to simply watch her suffer from the frustration and regret of failure just as he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, wouldn&#8217;t it be wise for &#8220;sensible adults&#8221; to protect her and wait for her to grow up little by little?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…I guess there&#8217;s nothing more to talk about.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san gulped down the remaining tea in one breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you for the treat. It was a waste of time.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He pulled a thousand-yen bill out of his wallet and placed it on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He then proceeded to retrieve Sato-san&#8217;s smartphone from the table in a fluid motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…The more I looked at it, the more I couldn&#8217;t believe that it was a simple smartphone that belonged to a high school girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when I look at it, I can remember it vividly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can remember the happy, angry, and crying faces of Sato-san who has worked so hard until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…the muscles]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san stopped his hand from reaching for her smartphone.</span></p>
</div>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Muscles grow only when they hurt each other.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to this, Kazuharu-san let out a deep sigh of dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Didn&#8217;t you hear what I said? There are also some humans who stop growing after getting hurt…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[And muscles cry when they&#8217;re deprived of the opportunity to hurt themselves.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stare back at Kazuharu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand his beliefs and determination, but… But still, he&#8217;s wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s neither you nor me, it&#8217;s Koharu-san herself who desires it. Even if it&#8217;s objectively illogical, she chose this way of growth.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Then what will happen if it causes her to break down…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[She will not…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I declared it firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Sato-san is certainly not good at communication, and her mental strength may not be very strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she definitely uploaded a picture to Minsta that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time she uploaded a photo of her ice cream roll to Minsta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure she must have a lot of anxiety and remorse swirling around inside her that can&#8217;t be put into words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Even so, she had ventured out alone into the vast sea of the Internet. There was no way she was going to be broken by a little failure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You are talking about the theory of education but you are just being overprotective. She has always been a strong person, contrary to what you think.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…I see.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san retracted his extended hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, I noticed that the scorn and look of contempt had disappeared from his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Seems like you aren&#8217;t saying this superficially. Since it has become like this, it will be just endless arguments, so let&#8217;s change the subject.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, he pointed to Sato-san&#8217;s smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Currently, Koharu is obsessed with Minstagram. But what does it really mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What does…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I just can&#8217;t understand it. I don&#8217;t get it. Is it really worth the risk we talked about earlier? It just looks worthless to me, nothing else.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san&#8217;s eyes looking at me once again turned sharp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I heard that all the junior high and high school students nowadays are eager to show off their photos on this app, but what value is there in that act? I also don&#8217;t understand why they are taking pictures of everything, whether it&#8217;s food or not. People say it&#8217;s to preserve memories, but I&#8217;m an old-fashioned person, so that&#8217;s what I think.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He pushed up the bridge of his glasses with his middle finger and said in a cold tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t see the need to record something that would otherwise fade from memory.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clamped my mouth shut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have words to return back. In fact, I knew that a question like this was bound to come up, so I had even prepared a response in advance so that I could theoretically refute it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I refrained from speaking was because I felt that it would be different if I came here and answered in an orderly manner with prepared words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulped down all the crappy answers I had prepared, stood up slowly, and said…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Is it that strange?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, all the scenes since I have met Sato-san are flashing back inside my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we drank the tapioca milk tea, when we ate the ice cream roll and then when we both took the photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Certainly, it&#8217;s just as Kazuharu-san said, there may be no point in recording things that would otherwise disappear.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind me, the setting sun was about to sink into the horizon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A single tear trail down my cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know exactly what these tears really mean. They were the tears of grief for the days of my unrequited love that would never come back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was heartbreakingly sad, but still, I had no regrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No matter how much fun you had, no matter how much you want to remember, most things will be forgotten sooner or later, everything will change, but still…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I can still remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can remember the excitement, the hesitation, the struggle, and the inexplicable happiness of that moment when I was in love with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then it came to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t only Kazuharu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father and the girls who were sitting on the other side of the terrace even forgot to take a breath as their eyes were snatched away by the spectacle unfolding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The world was enveloped in a warm golden colour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The &#8220;cafe tutuji&#8221; and the flower garden decorated with seasonal flowers were all enveloped in the golden color and shining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything I saw was colored by the fantastic lights, and the magic began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the thing I wanted to show to Sato-san and her father. The treasure that only my father and I have been monopolizing till now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A magical time that comes only for a short time, just after sunrise and just before sunset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A momentary miracle of soft light that makes for the most mysterious and dramatic photos of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said to him in the pale light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Is it so strange to want to show off, to want to remember, even if only for a moment, the excitement of being with someone important?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hues of the world change vividly, and the flower garden changes its appearance again and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them are beautiful, and none of them are the same, not even for a second. This fleeting and shifting scene itself was my answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…I see. So this is what Koharu saw.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san exhales a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I noticed, his face was back to the usual sour face, but still.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dad and I believe that our treasure was able to move his heart, even if it was just a little bit…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…That&#8217;s enough.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said so coldly, pushing up the bridges of his glasses with his middle finger. The eyes behind the glasses are as sharp and wet as a sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the girls who have been fascinated by the magic of the magical hour, the same as Kazuharu-san, probably noticed this and immediately held their smartphones to execute the next strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Kazuharu-san got the better of it and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I said enough is enough, they&#8217;re your setup too, aren&#8217;t they?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san sharp eyes caught sight of a group of four men and women sitting around a table under a parasol a short distance from here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Hiiii!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Shizuku-san who let out a short squeal when exposed to his intimidating glare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ren held his head in his arm in the blunder of his big sister, Mayo-san who sighed slightly, there was also Rinka-chan with her back facing this side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them had their phones in their hands and were preparing for the next strategy, &#8220;Send a bunch of MINE to Sato-san&#8217;s phone using her friend&#8217;s taste and appeal to her emotions,&#8221; but it seems that Kazuharu-san had already seen through them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t know what you are planning to do, but that&#8217;s shallow thinking.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Kuh…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a cry of frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san took back the smartphone placed on the table and then lifted the paper bag placed near the chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is going.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried desperately to think of a way to keep him from leaving, but no words came out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my dad and my treasure didn&#8217;t do the trick, then I can only feel the despair that any words I say will be meaningless in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my mind was in midst of burning frustration, Kazuharu-san looked up at me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…They are the friends of Koharu, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I was at a loss for an answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However I rethink and immediately answer strongly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Yes, that&#8217;s right.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…So including you, there are five people…Hmph… That&#8217;s a lot more than me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san… laughed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was surprised at the scene in front of me, Kazuharu-san once again turned to look at me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…First of all, you guys are misunderstanding something.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Misunderstanding…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Oshio Sota, why do you think I took back the smartphone from Koharu?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why… Because you didn&#8217;t like how Koharu-san was using her smartphone, so you took back the smartphone…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Wrong.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Huh, what? Is it different?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What kind of parents would do that nowadays? This is the cause of it.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Kazuharu-san took something out of a paper bag and spread it out on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was several pamphlets of a major telecommunication carrier, and a small box of some kind. Is this…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[A Wi-Fi router…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I raised my eyebrows quizzically, Kazuharu-san sighed deeply once more, and then uttered a shocking line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s a communication restrictor. It&#8217;s really troublesome to have an ignorant daughter.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">2 seconds, 3 seconds… I don&#8217;t know how much time passed, but eventually the silence was broken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「「「「「What???!!!!」」」」」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mine and four other screams overlapped.</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to this reaction, Kazuharu-san began to speak in a tone of shame, as if ashamed of her daughter&#8217;s blunder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…We have a data communication plan with a family share package. But because of Koharu&#8217;s obsession with the minsta thing you taught her, she used up all the internet data on her own, almost to the limit.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[By herself…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t know the details, but it seems that she was repeatedly viewing the same account&#8217;s photos over and over again… Thanks to that, I had to suffer through a lot of trouble. I can&#8217;t get in touch with my wife or reply to my work emails because of this annoying restriction. The news app that I used to look forward to every morning is now dead, and my schedule is completely screwed up.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Huh, but Kazuharu-san, you called me normally…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s possible to make a call and use the internet even if the data limit is on. You are also a highschool student, you should have known that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…But the message from Koharu-san for help?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That stupid girl was panicking thinking her phone broke as soon as the limit was imposed. She must have sent it sometime then.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wa-Wait a minute!!! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then does that mean, perhaps…!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I didn&#8217;t take back the smartphone but rather kept it temporarily…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The plan was only about keeping Koharu&#8217;s smartphone until the data connection speed gets lifted, so that she doesn&#8217;t enter strange places again… In any case, there isn&#8217;t any meaning in holding a smartphone that can&#8217;t be used.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What about being forbidden from going out?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I had to take Koharu to the store to change the contract for the communication plan. It would be inconvenient if I didn&#8217;t.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What was all that even for then…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my knees give out and collapsed on the spot..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the other four who had gathered here were dumbfounded by this stupid thing that had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…In the end, there are no parents anywhere who would constraint their daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> In front of me was just another father who, like Sato-san, was clumsy, uncommunicative, and had trouble expressing his feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was overcome with a feeling of exhaustion that swept over my entire body, Kazuharu-san abruptly said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, you will have to hear the rest from the person herself later.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, as if planned, the rear passenger door of the car parked in the parking lot opened by itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was strange, but soon the reason became apparent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had apparently been lying on the back seat, hiding herself, but now she finally revealed herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[……]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked embarrassed and apologetic, as if she was a child who knew she was about to be scolded. With tears welling up in her large eyes and her shoulders squeezed tightly together, she made her appearance, making her slender body even smaller than it already was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sato Koharu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She neatly bowed her head 90 degrees, drawing the attention of everyone present, and in a trembling voice,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m sorry!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said an apology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I… I didn&#8217;t know anything, and caused problems to Oshio-kun and everyone, and even the important promise we made for shaved ice…!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Raising her face which still looked as if she could cry at any moment and started talking on and on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she bowed 30 degrees again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I&#8217;m really, really sorry for everything!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a voice that seemed to reach over the horizon, she said her apologies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were at a loss for words at this turn of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In midst of this, Kazuharu-san, with his usual inorganic tone without showing any emotions,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…Well, I&#8217;m sure you have a lot to say about this incident, but it was my lack of explanation that caused this situation. I would like to apologize for that-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, he took out a sheet of paper from the pile of pamphlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a cheaply made pamphlet with the words &#8220;Sakuraba Grand Fireworks Festival 2020&#8221; written in popping letters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, it was an information pamphlet for a fireworks display.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Apparently, there&#8217;s going to be a fireworks display near here, and since it&#8217;s a festival, I&#8217;m sure there will be a stall or two lined up, like shaved ice…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Ka-Kazuharu-san…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well, Koharu seems to be reflecting on this and has completed all the errands for today. I will permit it if you only go out for a while. You should have a heart-to-heart talk over fireworks, right? Oshio Sota?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[…You, did you know everything…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I don&#8217;t know what you mean by that.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kazuharu-san said, feigning ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Oh my god.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is absurd, just like Sato-san. He had everything happening in the palm of his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t believe that there are parents who are so horrible, so cunning, and yet so sweet to their daughters…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You are too overprotective…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That was until today.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…And so, the fight between me and Kazuharu-san ended with my complete loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything went according to his plan.</span></p>
