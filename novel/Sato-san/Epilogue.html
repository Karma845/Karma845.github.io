<h3>Epilogue: Confession</h3>


<p>After Sato Koharu and Oshio Sota figure&#8217;s disappeared from &#8220;Cafe tutuji&#8221;,</p>
<p>[Thank you for waiting.]</p>
<p>The pancakes were brought to Sato Kazuharu&#8217;s table.</p>
<p>Sato Kazuharu, who was looking at the illuminated flower garden, glanced at it and said,</p>
<p>[I didn&#8217;t order this.]</p>
<p>[We are classmates from the same year, Kazuharu-kun.]</p>
<p>With that, Oshio Seizaemon sat down in the chair across from him.</p>
<p>Kazuharu looked away deliberately as if he was annoyed.</p>
<p>[What the h**l is this… I was about to take a breather after I finally felt the weight on my shoulder being lifted off. I hate sweet things. Both sweet things and people.]</p>
<p>[Hahaha, and yet you were so sweet to your daughter. You have become considerably mellow. In addition, you also lost the muscles. Didn&#8217;t you have more muscle in the American football team?]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s just you who hasn&#8217;t changed much. We aren&#8217;t students anymore, I don&#8217;t need useless muscles.]</p>
<p>[And these muscles on display aren&#8217;t useless.]</p>
<p>Seizaemon twisted his body while sitting to show off his upper body muscles.</p>
<p>However, Kazuharu didn&#8217;t even look at him. Instead he murmured,</p>
<p>[…I&#8217;m sorry to hear about Sakiko-san.]</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m surprised you can even say that too! It&#8217;s unthinkable progress from the time in highschool! I guess being a parent changes you!]</p>
<p>[Don&#8217;t be silly.]</p>
<p>[Hahaha, well, it&#8217;s alright now. Sota has grown up a lot.]</p>
<p>[Oshio Sota…]</p>
<p>[How was it?]</p>
<p>[What was?]</p>
<p>[You&#8217;re just playing dumb, you really wanted to see Sota, but you didn&#8217;t leave before the end, so does that mean you approve of him a little bit?]</p>
<p>Kazuharu didn&#8217;t respond, but as if remembering, he cut the pancake with the fork and knife at hand and brought it to his mouth.The wrinkles between his eyebrows deepened.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s so sweet, it&#8217;s giving me heartburn.]</p>
<p>[Because that&#8217;s the way it is. Ask me again when you come back.]</p>
<p>[I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d order something this sweet, let alone a cup of tea… Oh.]</p>
<p>Kazuharu suddenly raised his voice and held his head.</p>
<p>[What happened?]</p>
<p>When Sezaimon asked, he distorted his face in frustration and said,</p>
<p>[…Damn it, I forgot to take the photo.]</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s what he muttered to him.</p>
<p>♦️</p>
<p>[What a farce.]</p>
<p>I said it bluntly, fiddling with my smartphone after the two were gone.</p>
<p>[In the end, I just got along with those two guys.]</p>
<p>Shizuku-san was leaning against the backrest, stretching.</p>
<p>Next to her, Ren, who was looking at the sky in boredom, stood up from his seat and said,</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m going to the bathroom.]</p>
<p>Leaving behind these words, his figure disappeared in the store.</p>
<p>As soon as they heard the sound of the door closing in the distance, I was the only one of the three who was still staring at my smartphone, then Mayo-san said,</p>
<p>[You don&#8217;t have to hold back anymore.]</p>
<p>[Ugh…]</p>
<p>The expressionless face that I had until then was distorted into a crumpled mess, and I started crying, clutching my smartphone with both hands and stifling my voice.</p>
<p>I had already reached my limit.</p>
<p>I knew who he wanted to show the miracle of the magic hour, and I knew that their feelings were mutual.</p>
<p>[…This time is my loss…]</p>
<p>In a trembling voice but with clear intention, I put together my words.</p>
<p>[There&#8217;s no goal in love, so even if you like each other, there are plenty of times when things don&#8217;t work out…]</p>
<p>[No, you&#8217;re absolutely right.]</p>
<p>[Same here.]</p>
<p>Shizuku-san and Mayo-san say in a funny tone. There was no sympathy for the word, and I was grateful for it.</p>
<p>[So, the only time to cry is now…!]</p>
<p>[Rinka-chan is the most mature person.]</p>
<p>[The three of us are going out for drinks tonight.]</p>
<p>The two warm palms of the hand are placed on my back.</p>
<p>Rinka-chan never gives up.</p>
<p>♠️♥️</p>
<p>The warm breeze clung to our cheeks and disappeared behind us.</p>
<p>The sound of a grasshopper crying and the sound of a rusty pedal spinning can be heard from somewhere.</p>
<p>The magic hour has long since passed, and darkness was enveloping the area.</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>I pedaled slowly and carefully, being very careful not to shake the girl sitting behind me.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t turn around to check her out, and I haven&#8217;t touched her with even one fingertip. But I can feel her presence on my back.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I feel like my heart is going to explode.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was the same for her. We hadn&#8217;t had a real conversation in the tens of minutes since we started riding together.</p>
<p>Speaking of conversation,</p>
<p>[Are you okay back there?]</p>
<p>[…Yes, I&#8217;m all right]</p>
<p>[I see…]</p>
<p>It must be that.</p>
<p>…Of course it would be awkward, because even after the battle with a formidable enemy, Sato Kazuharu, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I was rejected!</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>This silence hurts.</p>
<p>The two of us on a bicycle, a situation that is synonymous with youth, helped us in the end. Because right now, there&#8217;s no way I can see Sato-san&#8217;s face from the front… However…</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to have a heart-to-heart talk, isn&#8217;t it, Oshio Sota?</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>Why did that person&#8217;s words now pass through my mind?</p>
<p>He can&#8217;t possibly know that I&#8217;m in an awkward situation with Sato-san right now, he can&#8217;t possibly know… He couldn&#8217;t possibly know, right?</p>
<p>I feel like that was a statement that he knew all along… No, that&#8217;s not irrelevant.</p>
<p>Either way, I have to settle my relationship with Sato-san.</p>
<p>I spit down my thirsty throat, and then said,</p>
<p>[Sato-san!] [Oshio-kun!]</p>
<p>[Ah…]</p>
<p>Our voices unexpectedly overlapped, and I blushed from the embarrassment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad that I&#8217;m on a bicycle.</p>
<p>[…Ah, hahah, Sato-san, you can go first.]</p>
<p>[Well, uh… Yeah, then I will say first.]</p>
<p>After I said it, I felt self-loathing because of my shamelessness.</p>
<p>Why did I have to be so…!</p>
<p>While I was hesitating, Sato-san said &#8220;Well…&#8221; , still embarrassed.</p>
<p>[…First of all, thank you, andI&#8217;m sorry… I&#8217;m sorry for all the trouble I caused Oshio-kun and others… Father was scary, wasn&#8217;t he?]</p>
<p>[…A bit.]</p>
<p>It was actually a lot.</p>
<p>If I were to be shouted at suddenly by that piercing voice, I would certainly have cried. It&#8217;s the charm of a highschool boy to lie to a certain extent.</p>
<p>[But don&#8217;t worry about it, everything seems to have been settled.]</p>
<p>[…You are as amazing as I expected, Oshio-kun. I have been with Father for sixteen years and I&#8217;m still scared of him.]</p>
<p>[……]</p>
<p>I feel a little sorry for Kazuharu-san who is so devoted to his children, but that wasn&#8217;t passed at all… No child knows how dear they are to their parents.</p>
<p>[Anyway, thank you really very much, Oshio-kun…]</p>
<p>I got thrown off when she whispered that suddenly.</p>
<p>Stop it, my throbbing heart!</p>
<p>As I was able to calm down my own heartbeats without using my hands, Sato-san took a deep breath as if she had made up her mind.</p>
<p>[…And then there is one more thing, about the confession earlier…]</p>
<p>My heartbeats subsided. On the contrary, it may have stopped completely.</p>
<p>[A-Ah, the confession, huh…]</p>
<p>It was a miracle that I was able to reply.</p>
<p>Whether she knew how I felt or not, Sato-san began to talk.</p>
<p>[…I have been thinking ever since, that after all I have to reply properly again to Oshio-kun.]</p>
<p>[Hyuu]</p>
<p>At the abrupt death sentence, a strange voice came out.</p>
<p>Why is that at this time…?!</p>
<p>[Well, you don&#8217;t have to force yourself, you know…?]</p>
<p>The words I somehow squeezed out were my final resistance. If she were to say that once again, [I&#8217;m sorry but I couldn&#8217;t see Oshio-kun as member of the opposite s*x. Thank you for being my friend from now on], I would seriously throw up. I will cry and throw up. So God, please stop!</p>
<p>As I pedaled along, praying to the Gods of love, I wondered if they existed, and Sato-san opened her mouth as if she had made up her mind&#8212;-</p>
<p>[Actually, at the time Oshio-kun called me and confessed to me, I was taking a bath at that time… And then I immediately felt dizzy and my mom had to carry me out!]</p>
<p>[…Huh?]</p>
<p>The confession was very different from what I had expected, and I let out a silly squeak.</p>
<p>[Feeling dizzy… Were you taking a long bath?]</p>
<p>[U-Umm… It&#8217;s not like that…]</p>
<p>Sato-san squirmed behind the back in embarrassment.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, Sato-san finally seemed to have made up her mind and said the words.</p>
<p>[&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;I was that happy when the man I love confessed his love to me.]</p>
<p>After those words, the whole world went blank.</p>
<p>The buzzing of insects and the whirring of pedals fade into the distance.</p>
<p>[…I was really, really embarrassed and was at a loss on what to do, but… Actually, my memory of that moment, especially the last part, is pretty hazy, and I woke up on my bed…]</p>
<p>The only thing I can feel now is Sato-san&#8217;s breathing, her heat, and the words she spins.</p>
<p>[…That&#8217;s why, I wanted to reply once again properly and seriously to Oshio-kun… It&#8217;s a bit cowardly, but Oshio-kun also confessed on Mine… So we are even, aren&#8217;t we?]</p>
<p>[What…?]</p>
<p>Those words were almost dream-like. I had to swallow it halfway through.</p>
<p>The reason was I was suddenly hugged from behind.</p>
<p>Sato-san, who was so hot like she was burning up, hugged me from behind.</p>
<p>Then, Sato-san said&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>[&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;I also like Oshio-kun, I can&#8217;t say it face to face yet but I have always liked you, even before when you saved me from those scary guys at cafe tutuji that day.]</p>
<p>A low sound echoed throughout the area, and the sky brightened up.</p>
<p>It must have been fireworks. But I didn&#8217;t have time to look at them.</p>
<p>[O-Oshio-kun, what were you going to say…?]</p>
<p>My line of sight blurred, feeling the warmth of her body.</p>
<p>…I really am glad that I am on a bicycle, I thought.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to show that face to her.</p>
<p>I still wanted to be a cool person in front of her.</p>
<p>[Let&#8217;s go to various places again from now on.]</p>
<p>[…First is shaved ice, right?]</p>
<p>[…That&#8217;s right.]</p>
<p>Fireworks go up one after another, coloring the night of early summer.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t use my smartphone right now because my hands are full, but even if I don&#8217;t take a picture or upload it to Minsta, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll never forget this sight.</p>
<p>I thought to myself as I cried quietly so that she wouldn&#8217;t see me.</p>
