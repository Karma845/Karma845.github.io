<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Salt-God Sato-san.</h3>


<p>&#8220;Flower garden&#8221; the pride of this store—on the terrace seat overlooking this was the figure of a highschool girl.</p>



<p>&nbsp;[Hmm…….close, I wonder if it would have been better to take this photo closer? No, close up…….sizzling]</p>



<p>A girl stares at freshly made pancakes through the screen of her smartphone.</p>



<p>I mutter while looking at her from a distance</p>



<p>[Sato-san….isnt it?]</p>



<p>Sato Koharu of the same class. Another name is “Salt god Sato-san”.</p>



<p>Pop-cut black hair that is evenly cut around the shoulders and gently wrapped inside, long eyes, and a straight nose. She looks like she&#8217;s somewhere between cute and beautiful, and her well-groomed appearance attracts a lot of attention.</p>



<p>Koharu, with the help of such a cute name, there were countless people who have tried to get closer to her.</p>



<p>However till now no single classmate was able to get close with her,why is that so?</p>



<p>—I&#8217;m not that close with you to begin with.</p>



<p>This was the legendary reply given by Sato Koharu when a handsome guy from another class recklessly invited her to a date.</p>



<p>It was only a few seconds after the handsome guy approached her, and she didn&#8217;t even move a muscle in her face during this time.</p>



<p>—I wonder if you were able to understand it?</p>



<p>Sato-san is always &#8220;salty&#8221; to everyone, young and old, male and female, of course regardless of their beauty or ugliness too.</p>



<p>[No] [It&#8217;s tiresome] [So what?]&nbsp; [Can I go home now?]</p>



<p>etc…..These words, devoid of any warmth, are fired like a shotgun from a completely blank face.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the thing that still draws people to her is her overly well groomed appearance.</p>



<p>She was given the nickname &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221; in recognition of her achievements in shooting people who were attracted to her.</p>



<p>Leaving aside that……</p>



<p>&#8220;Sato-san, what is she doing alone&#8230;&#8230;?”</p>



<p>Currently she is looking at her phone right in front of my eyes while swaying her upper body in all directions&nbsp;and repeating ‘un’ not that ‘ah’ not that too.</p>



<p>Judging from the situation, I think she is trying to take a picture of the pancake but</p>



<p>[I wonder if she usually takes photos of pancakes with such a serious face.]</p>



<p>She seems to be very focused that she did not even notice when the pancake was carried from here.</p>



<p>No, it&#8217;s quite possible that Sato-san doesn&#8217;t recognize me as a classmate. If I heard that from the mouth of the person in question, my heart would be broken, so that being the case I pretended not to notice it either.</p>



<p>—Incidentally, the name of this naive high school boy is Oshio Sota.</p>



<p>This is a part-time job at &#8220;Cafe Tutuji&#8221;, a hidden garden cafe in Sakuraba City.</p>



<p>In my experience as a skilled part timer – although I&#8217;m the only one in a part-time job— It&#8217;s rare for customers to come to the store alone. More so if its a high school girl.</p>



<p>Moreover,</p>



<p>[I wonder from which angle would it look best&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>She is even muttering to herself in an interesting way.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible not to pay attention to her like this.</p>



<p>Though saying that, she&#8217;s now a customer so it&#8217;s not good to listen too much.</p>



<p>I thought better of it and was about to retreat to the back of the store when it happened……..</p>



<p>&nbsp;[. . . . Onee-san, what are you doing from a while ago? ]</p>



<p>Vaguely, I heard a sweet voice as if it was made up so when I look back again, the three male college students next table were entangling Sato-san.</p>



<p>At first, Sato-san seemed a little perplexed by the sudden voice but she soon regained her usual beautiful expressionless face.</p>



<p>[Does it have any relation with you?]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>[Sato-san, come here]</p>



<p>I lend my shoulder to the sobbing Sato-san while guiding her to the residential part attached to the cafe—that is my room.</p>



<p>[&#8230;..delicious]</p>



<p>Sato-san, sitting on a chair, narrowed her reddish eyes and let out a sigh. In her hand is a steaming teacup.</p>



<p>[Earl grey,I always drink this]</p>



<p>Saying only that, I sat down on the opposite side of the bed and sipped my tea.</p>



<p>The gorgeous scent of bergamot and the refreshing scent of citrus is mingling in my nose.</p>



<p>Well leaving aside the slight complex details, the taste is so soothing that a sigh naturally comes out.</p>



<p>After that, Sato-san sips the tea little by little several times—finally seemed to have sort out the situation.</p>



<p>Bringing tea cup to her mouth, she looks at me with apologetic and upturned eyes and asks</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun&#8230;.do you know me&#8230;..?]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>There&#8217;s probably no one in the same grade of high school who doesn&#8217;t know the &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221;.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;I know, I was wondering if I should call out to you, however Sato-san was looking into her smartphone so seriously that I decided not to.]</p>



<p>The truth is that I was just afraid it would become apparent that she didn&#8217;t recognize my existence. However, I guess little lying is just the way naive high school boys are.</p>



<p>[What were you doing with that serious face earlier?]</p>



<p>[Uuu&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Probably not something she wants to be asked?</p>



<p>Sato-san started to blush, fidgeting her fingers on the edge of the cup.</p>



<p>Seriously, was she really the &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221; I heard of?</p>



<p>[No, it&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t want to say&#8230;..]</p>



<p>[&#8230;.O,Oshio-kun! Can you look at this?..]</p>



<p>It seems that she made some decision while kneading her thumb.</p>



<p>Firm with what Sato-san said, she pulled out her smartphone and placed it in front of me.</p>



<p>The phone cover is a simple one that looks like it could be sold at a 100 yen store, with no decoration, to the extent that no one can imagine it belongs to a highschool girl.</p>



<p>It looks much more &#8220;salty&#8221; than Sato-san herself.</p>



<p>[Is something wrong with the smartphone?]</p>



<p>[That&#8230;&#8230;.this, this picture&#8230;..]</p>



<p>Saying that, Sato-san timidly pointed at the display of smartphone.</p>



<p>There are several photo files lined up&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[Is it ok to see?]</p>



<p>I won&#8217;t get charged for a crime by looking through a highschool girl&#8217;s  photo folders, right?</p>



<p>Thinking that I asked timidly to which she turned red like an apple while nodding her head repeatedly.</p>



<p>While having some hesitation, I looked in the display and</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;the hell is this]</p>



<p>Unintentionally I let out such a voice.</p>



<p>No, of course I understand what content is there.</p>



<p>From one end of the screen to the other, the &#8220;sweets photos&#8221; that she has taken so far are lined up.</p>



<p>Well if it&#8217;s only that then it&#8217;s probably safe to say something like,</p>



<p>[Heee~so you likes sweet, it&#8217;s good, it&#8217;s cute I think]</p>



<p>However&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>[Sato-san, you are so bad at taking pictures&#8230;.]</p>



<p>The straight impression popped out of my mouth unconsciously dying Sato-san&#8217;s face red to the tip of her ears.</p>



<p>No, a little more. They are bad to the extent you can&#8217;t believe.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this to a girl I&#8217;ve never spoken to, but she is hopelessly bad at this.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a problem before it even begins to look good.</p>



<p>For example, in the photo of the cake, the whole thing was so dark that I couldn&#8217;t even recognize it as a food at first and I couldn&#8217;t get the slightest feeling that it looked appetizing.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s especially bad at&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;This is a photo that I don&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>From the backlit, the whole picture is overexposed ,not just the food, I&#8217;m not even sure what&#8217;s in the picture.In the first place I can&#8217;t even figure out the content of the photo.</p>



<p>Eh, what the hell is this? Did a meteorite fall out the moment the shutter drops?</p>



<p>Thinking that,when I looked carefully, it was the picture of the pancake Sato-san was taking earlier.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s probably a joke, right?</p>



<p>Picture folder is buried from top to bottom with such impactful pictures.</p>



<p>When I completely closed my mouth, Sato-san slowly opened her mouth while her shoulders were shaking a little.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s an embarrassing story, but in fact I &#8230; don&#8217;t have any friends &#8230;..]</p>



<p>[Ehh……., I thought&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I thought you didn&#8217;t have any interest in other people.</p>



<p>I was about to say that, but I panicked and closed my mouth.</p>



<p>Close! As expected, it would have been too rude.</p>



<p>[Is,is that so?&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s really surprising.]</p>



<p>[I,I think my stories are dull so they leave me quickly.]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Wrong, you are wrong Oshio Souta.</p>



<p>Its not like she is trying to pretend so it&#8217;s definitely not crazy.</p>



<p>Sato-san is currently opening herself by revealing serious trouble.</p>



<p>[But, as expected I&#8217;m a highschool girl so I also wants to make friends&#8230;&#8230;.that&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s why?]</p>



<p>[I thought If I become minstagramar, I would be able to make friends]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>I tightly bind my mouth.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. Definitely don&#8217;t laugh, Oshio Souta.</p>



<p>[&#8230;. I like sweets so I often go out after school or on weekends to eat sweets by myself. So if I post that on Minsta, it&#8217;ll give me something to talk about with everyone&#8230;.. something like that]</p>



<p>[Mi, minsta, yeah, all high school girls do it. &#8230;..]</p>



<p>&#8230;..Now let me add something.</p>



<p>Minsta is the abbreviation for app Minstagram, that focuses on posting photos.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s used by high school girls and other celebrities all over the country. &#8212;&#8212; To put it simply, it&#8217;s an app that allows you to communicate with an unspecified number of people by sharing stylish photos.</p>



<p>And Minstagrammer is the person who uses this app.</p>



<p>[Tha,That&#8217;s great! If you post a photo on Minstagram, it will change the way people look at Sato-san.]</p>



<p>That was the real intention.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, they&#8217;ll probably change their minds.</p>



<p>Because You know, that &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221; who goes around trendy cafes on her days off and posts pictures of sweets that look &#8220;minsta-worthy&#8221;?</p>



<p>If that happens, then the eyes around her will probably change, and will soon have many friends around&#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>As I thought if that happens, in a voice that sounded like it was about to fade, Sato-san said,&nbsp;</p>



<p>[But I am a little terrible at taking photos&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>A little&#8230;&#8230;I wonder&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m worried that I&#8217;ll be bullied severely the next day if I upload these pictures to Minsta&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; like If my indoor shoes were hidden or if I was forced to write, I couldn&#8217;t even make an account when I thought about it&#8230;&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>Sato-san&#8217;s face turned pale while uttering that herself.</p>



<p>I thought Sato-san was one of the top students in his grade, but is she actually an idiot &#8230;&#8230;?</p>



<p>However, I generally understand the gist of it.</p>



<p>About Sato-san&#8217;s problems. She&#8217;s not really the &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221; that everyone calls her.</p>



<p>And that she is making an effort to change that situation somehow.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m borrowing it for a while.]</p>



<p>[Eh, it&#8217;s alright but what for&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>I draw her phone and start the camera app.</p>



<p>Then, with a familiar hand, I tweaked the bint, brightness, selected the filter, and with the shutter, bang, the photo was saved.</p>



<p>[Here you are]</p>



<p>At first Sato-san was skeptical, but as soon as she saw the screen, her big eyes were widened further—</p>



<p>[This&#8230;.]</p>



<p>In front of Sato-san astonishing gaze, the display of her smartphone now shows a picture of black tea that looks worthy of Minsta.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s better than mine&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>That&#8217;s obvious.</p>



<p>[H&#8230;&#8230;how did Oshio-kun do this?]</p>



<p>Sato-san called my name, unable to say anything as she was too excited.</p>



<p>I take out my phone to dispel the doubt.</p>



<p>[I am also using Minsta though more accurately it&#8217;s Cafe Tutuji&#8217;s promotional account]</p>



<p>My phone displayed Minsta&#8217;s My Page.</p>



<p>There are a lot of photos I have taken so far on behalf of my ignorant father who was scared of SNS.</p>



<p>The pancakes on the signboard menu, the limited-time flavour tea and the seasonal flowers that bloom in the flower garden.</p>



<p>The total number of photos posted and the number of followers is &#8230;&#8230;..</p>



<p>[The number of followers is 5,000 &#8230;&#8230;.!]</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



		
<p>Sato-san looked back and forth between the screen of smartphone and my face, as if she couldn&#8217;t believe what she was seeing, and then blurted out.</p>



<p>[You are……..a minstagramar.]</p>



<p>…….I see, perhaps her plan to change the image with Minsta may not have been wrong.</p>



<p>After all, the way Sato-san looked at me had completely changed to one of respect.</p>



<p>In the last one hour, I learned two things about Sato-san</p>



<p>One, Sato-san is a &#8220;salty&#8221; person, but this does not mean that she is not interested in other people or that she lacks any emotion, rather in contrast she is overly sensitive to others.</p>



<p>According to the person in question….</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ve always been nervous when talking to people, and it seems that the number of people I can talk with just gets smaller… Oh, but it&#8217;s okay when talking with Okaa-san.]</p>



<p>If you open the lid, nothing happens.</p>



<p>“Salt god Sato-san&#8217;s&#8221; real character is actually “Extremely shy Sato-san.”</p>



<p>……..What the hell is this?</p>



<p>And one more thing.</p>



<p>Her photography sense is devastating.</p>



<p>[Thi….how is it this time, Oshio-kun!?]</p>



<p>[Well……]</p>



<p>I stared at her phone, which she confidently held out to me, and growled slightly.</p>



<p>This is not to say that I can&#8217;t judge whether her photos are good or bad.</p>



<p>How can I tell her that this picture is the worst without hurting her delicate heart? …I&#8217;m trying to choose my words but</p>



<p>[…….No, it&#8217;s the worst. I can&#8217;t even understand how it turns out like that.]</p>



<p>In the end…I decided to convey it upfront.</p>



<p>No……rather it&#8217;s already not in the range of artistic sense.</p>



<p>How can a photo of tea from just now turn so unappetizing?</p>



<p>This is a unique talent already, isn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>As my thoughts began to drift into the realm of philosophy, I noticed that Sato-san had gone quiet.</p>



<p>I come to my senses and look up to see that Sato-san has tears in his eyes and her shoulders are shaking.</p>



<p>[What?]</p>



<p>[Eh,wait………Sato-san?]</p>



<p>[You…You didn&#8217;t have to go that far…..]</p>



<p>Within a moment, Sato-san&#8217;s lips turned sharp and tears started falling from her trembling eyes.</p>



<p>—Bad.</p>



<p>[—ah! no, well that……..yeah!. I think it&#8217;s better then earlier!]</p>



<p>[Really!?]</p>



<p>Hearing that, Sato-san&#8217;s facial expressions turned lighter.</p>



<p>………A lie that doesn&#8217;t hurt other people is a kind lie.</p>



<p>But what&#8217;s with that &#8220;Salt god Sato-san&#8221;, isn&#8217;t she filled to the extreme with sentiment.</p>



<p>[I wonder if I could become a famous minstagrammer with a little more practice.]</p>



<p>Ah, look, I just praised a little but she immediately got carried away.</p>



<p>At this rate, those repulsive pictures will be released in the sea of internet.</p>



<p>Only that should be avoided at any cost. For her sake and for the world&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p>Driven by a sense of duty, I climbed down from the bed and walked behind her in the chair.</p>



<p>[But I think it would better if it&#8217;s this way]</p>



<p>[Ehh, Oshio-kun…..]</p>



<p>[Start the camera app]</p>



<p>[Eh….o,ok. I am opening…..hyaaa&#8211;]</p>



<p>As I extend my arm out from behind her and put my hand on her phone,Sato-san let out a high-pitched scream.</p>



<p>My ears are stunned.</p>


<p>[uwa….you surprised me.]</p>



<p>[Sur sur sur…..but I was the one who was surprised? Your hand…and face is too close.]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s easier to teach if we look at the same screen like this…..because Sato-san, you aren&#8217;t focusing.]</p>



<p>Kaaaaaaa and Sato-san&#8217;s face turned so red that I could even see it from behind.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>—Running as fast as I could</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what was going on anymore, so I just ran.</p>



<p>People on the street looked back at me and wondered what I was doing, but I was no longer aware of them.</p>



<p>Only one fact occupies my heart.</p>



<p>That is&#8230;..</p>



<p>[I entered the room of &#8220;my first love&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>In my feverish mind, I&#8217;m swirling with regrets about the blunders I made today and the fact that I talked too much because of the high tension.</p>



<p>I wonder if our chat went well? I didn&#8217;t say anything strange, right?</p>



<p>It was probably because I was thinking about all that that I didn&#8217;t realise my fatal blunder, only when it started to get dark that I realised.</p>



<p>—I forgot my smartphone.</p>



<p>I noticed it when I was screaming burying my face in my pillow, remembering the blunders I made today.</p>



<p>I feel like I&#8217;ve used up this year&#8217;s worth of blunder just in this one day, and I&#8217;ve got one last &#8220;blunder&#8221; that&#8217;s going to use up next year&#8217;s worth.</p>



<p>&#8230;&#8230;..Even if it had to happen, what was the need for it to be in my favourite person&#8217;s house, my smartphone&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s no use crying over spilt milk. For now there are only two options, either I go back to get it or don&#8217;t go.</p>



<p>It was a very difficult question for me.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s already time for the cafe to be closed and I will also trouble Oshio-kun by visiting late.</p>



<p>Moreover, if we were to face each other again, I didn&#8217;t know what would happen due to too much embarrassment this time.</p>



<p>I was troubled.</p>



<p>It will probably trouble me till next year.</p>



<p>After struggling so much that I felt like I was going to have a fever,</p>



<p>[Let&#8217;s take it back after the bath]</p>



<p>I settled on this conclusion.</p>



<p>Okaa-san seemed quite surprised to see me starting to apply my makeup after a thorough shower at around seven o&#8217;clock, but I managed to cover it up.</p>



<p>So now, I once again return to that road. I finally made it up till here.</p>



<p>Surrounded by the lukewarm air of early summer nights, I, Sato koharu, squeezed my painfully throbbing chest.</p>



<p>[Uu&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..]</p>



<p>If I turn around the corner right there, I will see &#8220;Cafe Tutuji&#8221;—that is Oshio-kun&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>Coming here, my heart&#8217;s thumping reached its peak. My breathing turned rough and my face also turned red.</p>



<p>—Because Oshio-kun is my first love.</p>



<p>We haven&#8217;t talked that much in class. I keep looking at him from afar doing my best to not get noticed but his cool face has already been etched in my eyes.</p>



<p>Slender legs, slightly drowsy eyes, soft hair and dimples that appear when he smiles.</p>



<p>And today, I discovered a new fact that he is an employee at such a fashionable cafe, moreover a Minstagrammar too.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure he is very popular, unlike me&#8230;..</p>



<p>Thinking that far,I just reconfirmed how miserable I am and because of that my legs became heavier.</p>



<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s better to go back home&#8230;&#8230; somehow up to that point such feeling gushed out but</p>



<p>[….I’ve already reached this far]</p>



<p>I told myself that and took a deep breath.</p>



<p>Finally turning around the corner, I gulped down the air looking at the view in front of me.</p>



<p>[Ehh&#8230;..]</p>



<p>The lights were on despite the fact that Cafe Tutuji should have been already closed.</p>



<p>The twinkling, yet warm glow of the decorative lights illuminates the flower garden, giving it a magical beauty.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a childish analogy, but it was as if I had lost myself in the world of picture books.</p>



<p>[That is&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>As if inviting me, I went step by step through the flower garden.</p>



<p>And so when I passed through the arch of flowers, I recognized him in the center of such a fantastic world.</p>



<p>There is Oshio-kun, with a cup of tea in his hand, alone in the terrace seat with his legs crossed.</p>



<p>[Oshio-kun&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>Unknowingly, I muttered his name.</p>



<p>It may not be that my voice reached him, but Oshio-kun noticed me, placed the partially drunk cup on the table, smiled kindly and said</p>



<p>[Sato-san, I was waiting for you ]</p>



<p>The moment I heard his voice, I thought that my heart, which had been beating so fast, seriously stopped.</p>



<p>My head turned blank, unable to let out any words.</p>



<p>Seeing me in such a state, Oshio-kun stood up and slowly walked over to me.</p>



<p>Wait, it&#8217;s dangerous now, it&#8217;s dangerous now, it&#8217;s dangerous now because—</p>



<p>[You came for your phone, didn&#8217;t you? Here it is.]</p>



<p>Oshio-kun handed me my smartphone.</p>



<p>I finally managed to open my throat, which had frozen shut.</p>



<p>[Pe,perhaps, you&#8217;ve been waiting for me?]</p>



<p>[Yeah, I thought you might come back for it, so I turned on the light and waited. You don&#8217;t want to leave your phone at a boy&#8217;s house, do you?]</p>



<p>[That, that&#8217;s!]</p>



<p>No, no, no. I shook my head.</p>



<p>Not good. No matter how smart I try to act, my mind goes blank in front of Oshio-kun and I can&#8217;t speak.</p>



<p>Seeing me like this, Oshio-kun smiled and said</p>



<p>[Is your house close? It&#8217;s not completely dark yet, but please be careful on your way home]</p>



<p>Leaving behind those words in the end,Oshio-kun turns around his heels to leave.</p>



<p>Ahh, Oshio-kun will leave.</p>



<p>[That]</p>



<p>Regardless of my intentions, the words came out of my mouth.</p>



<p>Thank you for doing all this. Lets meet again at school tomorrow.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s good, isn&#8217;t that the most beautiful way to end it?</p>



<p>Even though I know it in my head, yet words comes out arbitrary from my mouth</p>



<p>[That,is it ok to take a photo?]</p>



<p>Just as I said those words, I felt the blood drain from my body at once.</p>



<p>What, what are you saying, me!?</p>



<p>[Ah&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s different! That&#8230;.cafe garden is very beautiful&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s why! Look, I&#8217;m aiming to be a minstagrammar&#8230;.it looks great right!?]</p>



<p>[Do you want to take a picture of my garden? Of course you can but&#8230;]</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;Yeah! Yay! I&#8217;m sorry for all the trouble I&#8217;ve caused you, haha&#8230;&#8230;.]</p>



<p>What&#8217;s with the haha.</p>



<p>I held my phone side-handed and struck a deliberate &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a picture now&#8221; pose.</p>



<p>However, inside my head has already turned chaotic.</p>



<p>My hands were shaking helplessly and my eyes were blurred. I couldn&#8217;t even see what was on the screen.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m useless. Really, really useless.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t want Oshio-kun to think I&#8217;m a dumb woman any more, but my body won&#8217;t listen to me.</p>



<p>I wanted to disappear right now.</p>



<p>Just then, a hand reached out from behind me and placed itself on top of my hand.</p>



<p>It was thin and beautiful, but I knew it was a man&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>In the drawn out time where seconds seem to turn into minutes and hours, he said in his usual gentle voice.</p>



<p>[Let me help you]</p>



<p>That Instant, my finger slips and taps a button.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the button to switch between the external and internal cameras.</p>



<p>In other words, the screen of my phone now shows me and the figure of Oshio-kun supporting my hand from behind—.</p>



<p>Bikon.</p>



<p>[[Ahh]], Once again, the two voices overlap, and the two shots of me and Oshio-kun are saved on the phone.</p>



<p>A moment of silence passed between the two of us.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;ah, sorry&#8230;..It&#8217;s a selfie. Should I take it again?]</p>



<p>[N,no, It&#8217;s okay. I got a good shot! Oh, thank you, Oshio-kun&#8230;.!]</p>



<p>I pulled away from Oshio-kun as if I had been shot. The trembling had already stopped.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll see you at school.</p>



<p>With those last words, I gripped my phone tightly and left &#8220;Cafe Tutuji&#8221;. After leaving, I turned around the corner and fell to my knees.</p>



<p>[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]</p>



<p>I was already at the end of my rope in so many ways.</p>



<p>♠️</p>



<p>After I lost sight of Sato-san&#8217;s back, I collapsed to my knees on the spot.</p>



<p>[~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]</p>



<p>I had already reached my limit in many ways.</p>



<p>[Soutaa!]</p>



<p>With a beastly roar, from the bushes in the back,&nbsp; Muscle Daruma or to say Dad, jumps out.</p>



<p>Tou-san rushed towards me, covered me with a towel as he rubbed my back with his big hands.</p>



<p>It was only then that I realized that my back was drenched in sweat, as had my throat dried.</p>



<p>I grabbed a cup of tea with my trembling hands and drank it down in one gulp, the tea having long since gone cold.</p>



<p>[So,Tou-san]</p>



<p>[What is it, Souta!]</p>



<p>[I didn&#8217;t say anything strange right? or It wasn&#8217;t creepy?]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s okay! You looked handsome! You looked very handsome!]</p>



<p>Good&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>While my dad was fanning me with a towel, I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>



<p>I really thought my heart was going to stop.</p>
