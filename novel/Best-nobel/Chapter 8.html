<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>“Yuuto”</p>



<p>The next day, in the early afternoon, a woman’s voice called out to me as I was walking down the hallway.</p>



<p>When I turned around, there was a woman of about forty years old, who had recently started to gain a bit of width.</p>



<p>The woman, in her nobility dress, coupled with her width and the dress, looked like an opera singer.</p>



<p>“Mom”</p>



<p>Her name was Maia.</p>



<p>She was the birth mother of the transmigrated me.</p>



<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>



<p>“Have you seen my older sister?”</p>



<p>“Aida-san? No, I haven’t seen her”</p>



<p>“Is that so? I wonder where she went… If you happen to see her, tell her I’m looking for her, okay”</p>



<p>“Got it”</p>



<p>I nodded, and Maia left.</p>



<p>Maia and Aida were sisters.</p>



<p id="jump-1">In other words, Dimon was having the so-called threesome with two women who were sisters<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>.</p>



<p>When I was freshly transmigrated, I was surprised when I found out about this. Though apparently, from the point of view of nobles, it seemed that it was not that unusual for all sisters to marry the same man.</p>



<p>There was also a story that had a link with the coming of age ceremony.</p>



<p>Nobles who valued their bloodline often had political marriages based solely on ancestry.</p>



<p>And in the case of such a political marriage, you had to give birth to a boy who was the heir.</p>



<p>However, this was obvious, but there was no guaranteed way to give birth to a boy. And there was also the possibility that “you can’t give birth” in the first place.</p>



<p>In such a case, the legal wife, who couldn’t give birth to an heir, would sometimes lead her younger sister to marry the husband.</p>



<p>With sisters, there would be no issue with whichever one gave birth.</p>



<p>The interesting part started here.</p>



<p>Such things weren’t limited to political marriages.</p>



<p>Such a thing often happened in a love marriage, too.</p>



<p>In particular, the Romeo and Juliet type of love, with different social standing.</p>



<p>If the woman was poor, often her sisters would also marry into the family from the beginning as a set.</p>



<p>From the woman’s point of view, it was money and social statues gained by marrying a rich man. And it was the idea that her sisters could also be happier if they married together into a family where their lives could be improved.</p>



<p>In very rare cases, there was also a pattern of marrying as a concubine and then bringing in her sisters in order to expand the faction among the women.</p>



<p>In response to that, the legal wife sometimes would also bring in her younger sister as a concubine &#8212; was completely off topic.</p>



<p>Well, that was how it was.</p>



<p>As a former Japanese, that was something I still didn’t understand well, but apparently, that was how the nobles were, and sisters as wifes were something natural.</p>



<p>By the way, both Nanos, Janus, and myself were children born to Maia.</p>



<p>Aida couldn’t give birth to a child, so she brought in her younger sister &#8212; the usual pattern.</p>



<p>Well, it happened all the time in this world.</p>



<p>I split up from Maia and came to the living room.</p>



<p>There, I rang the bell and had my afternoon tea prepared.</p>



<p>Then Auxo came and served me.</p>



<p>Auxo, the maid whom I had my coming of age ceremony with.</p>



<p>She went on to be the one to attend to me &#8212; which was fine.</p>



<p>However, Auxo looked depressed for some reason.</p>



<p>She was serving me flawlessly, but it was obvious she was making a depressed face.</p>



<p>“Auxo”</p>



<p>“Yes, how can I help?”</p>



<p>“You’re worrying about something”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“You’re worrying about something, right?”</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry, master”</p>



<p>“I’m not telling you to apologize. What’s wrong, did something happen?”</p>



<p>“That’s… I’m sorry”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to apologize, just tell me if something happened”</p>



<p>“Yes&#8230;”</p>



<p>Auxo paused. After a bit of hesitation, she timidly began to talk while reading my mood.</p>



<p>“The truth is… My younger sister has been sold”</p>



<p>“Sold?”</p>



<p>“Yes, for reducing the mouths to feed”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>I nodded my head a little.</p>



<p>This one as well was something I heard often since my transmigration.</p>



<p>There was a lot of such a story. It was a story that had established a pattern that was as common as being hit by a truck and being transmigrated into another world.</p>



<p>“Your parents were working the fields, were they? Is it a bad harvest? This year”</p>



<p>“Yes… It isn’t that bad, but at this rate, they’re not sure if they are able to pay back the money for seed rice they borrowed this year’s spring”</p>



<p>“Aah… If I recall, you borrow money in the beginning of spring to buy seed, and pay it back from there after the harvest, is it”</p>



<p>“Yes”</p>



<p>Auxo feebly nodded.</p>



<p>Borrowing money for seeds in the beginning of spring and paying it back after the harvest.</p>



<p>That was also something common, even in the farming family of my former world.</p>



<p>In my former world, if there was a bad harvest, the government would give aid or something, so it wouldn’t immediately hurt you. However, a single typhoon was all it would take to start selling your child in this world.</p>



<p>Through that connection, human trafficking and slavery became commonplace.</p>



<p>“I remember you were also a slave, weren’t you”</p>



<p>“Yes”</p>



<p>“If that’s the case, then the same thing happened to your younger sister. That’s just all this is about, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“That’s true… But, I heard from my parents that the person who bought my younger sister was someone named Galamoth&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Galamoth… Was there any slave trader with that name?”</p>



<p>I held my chin with my fingers, digging through my memory.</p>



<p>Although I was good at remembering people’s names, I had never heard that name before.</p>



<p>“Yes… I also, since I’ve been taken into this residence, have heard various people’s names, especially names of slave traders. But it’s my first time hearing that name”</p>



<p>“I see, so that’s what’s making you worried, huh. Because you also don’t know where she was bought”</p>



<p>“Yes”</p>



<p>I pondered as I held my chin with my fingers.</p>



<p>“Oh, spending your early afternoon here?”</p>



<p>Janus came in.</p>



<p>He walked into the room, made a straight line towards me, and sat down across from me.</p>



<p>“Janus, huh. Good timing. Do you know a man named Galamoth?”</p>



<p>“Galamoth? The intermediary?”</p>



<p>“Rather than the mediator, the slave trader one”</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>Janus gave a small nod.</p>



<p>He knitted his brows and was making a very difficult face.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, well. It’s just”</p>



<p>“What are you on about? Tell me”</p>



<p>“You’re right… I guess I’ll tell you just the facts. I’ve never heard of a girl who truly became a slave through Galamoth”</p>



<p>“What did you say? What does that mean?”</p>



<p>“Yuuto, you know how different people have varying hobbies, right?”</p>



<p>“What, what’s with that weird way of putting it”</p>



<p>“There are truly all kinds of hobbies out there. And among them, there’s one ‘to break,’ you see”</p>



<p>“To break?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, to break. Well, putting it in a wholesome way, wood-chopping?,” so said Janus.</p>



<p>Usually, this would be the part where I would say, “Oh, I see,” but not in this conversation.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly, the main issue was the “next” one.</p>



<p>“&#8230;And in an unwholesome way?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Humans, huh”</p>



<p>Janus didn’t answer, and I guessed from the flow of the conversation.</p>



<p>I let out a small sigh.</p>



<p>“Intermediary, huh. Is that the guy who’s doing intermediary work?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. On the surface, though, he’s doing pretty well”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>“U-umm… Wha-what does that mean?”</p>



<p>Auxo asked in a feverish state.</p>



<p>Janus tilted his head.</p>



<p>“It seems that her younger sister was bought by that Galamoth”</p>



<p>“My goodness”</p>



<p>Janus made a pitying face.</p>



<p>Just the face.</p>



<p>Well, yeah, of course.</p>



<p>One was a noble, the other was a slave maid’s younger sister, to add further.</p>



<p>Because it was Janus, he would have given at least a slight pitying look, but normally, the difference in status and relationship would be more like giving a “Hmm,” response.</p>



<p>“Umm… Yuuto-sama…?”</p>



<p>“If that Galamoth bought her, what would happen to her younger sister?”</p>



<p>“Let’s see. In the cases I know of, I guess it‘s either to break quickly or to break slowly”</p>



<p>“Eh&#8230;”</p>



<p>Auxo’s expression gradually began to change.</p>



<p>“Is that right?”</p>



<p>“The customers who came to him are all those kinds of people. That world is small after all”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Immediately after.</p>



<p>Slowly understanding what Janus was saying, Auxo turned pale, opened her eyes wide, and ended up fainting due to too much shock.</p>
