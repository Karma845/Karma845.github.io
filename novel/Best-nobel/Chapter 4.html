<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>Once things were over, I was on the bed giving an arm pillow to Auxo.</p>



<p>I made love to a woman for the first time in seventeen years.</p>



<p>I became awfully frantic in the middle of it and afterwards I ended up thinking to myself, “I was so frantic, aren’t I.”</p>



<p>Well, even so, I should have been better than a true virgin.</p>



<p>There was nothing that looked like a screw up.</p>



<p>I tried to ask while giving Auxo an arm pillow.</p>



<p>“How was it?”</p>



<p>“I-I don’t know”</p>



<p>Auxo was bashful and buried her face in my chest.</p>



<p>I smiled slightly.</p>



<p>At the very least, Auxo’s such “That’s just embarrassing!” response was far away from a screw up.</p>



<p>So I was satisfied.</p>



<p>Having satisfied a woman one made love to brought an almost irreplaceable joy for a man.</p>



<p><em>I guess my experience in my previous life paid off, </em>as I was thinking, “But.”</p>



<p>While burying her face in my chest, Auxo timidly began to talk.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“It was better than I had heard”</p>



<p>“That so?”</p>



<p>“Yes… It’s because Yuuto-sama was very gentle”</p>



<p>“Fuu&#8230;”</p>




<p><em>This girl’s really cute</em>, I thought.</p>



<p>Auxo said such a lovely thing while burying her face in my chest.</p>



<p>And then I raised her face and kissed her.</p>



<p>Auxo, who was caught off guard, was surprised and startled for an instant, but she now accepted the kiss more easily than before I made love to her.</p>



<p>At the same time, a little poke with the tip of my tongue was enough to make her stick out her tongue and greet it.</p>



<p>Triggered by the passive but aggressive Auxo, my crotch began to throb even though it was just right after the deed.</p>



<p><em>It’s the first time in seventeen years, and I still haven’t done nearly enough after all.</em></p>



<p><em>Let’s just go straight to the second round,</em> at that moment.</p>



<p>――You have met the requirements for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Activating the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“Eh? What’s the matter, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“What, you asked. You didn’t hear that just now?”</p>



<p>“That?”</p>



<p>Auxo tilted her head.</p>



<p>Her eyes opened wide and was staring in puzzlement.</p>



<p>“You asked whether I heard it… But what was it?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Something about skills”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t think I heard… It”</p>



<p>Auxo’s voice was getting smaller and smaller midway through.</p>



<p>After speaking out, I could clearly see that she was scared that she may have incurred my displeasure.</p>



<p><em>That kind of reaction means that she really didn’t hear it?</em></p>



<p><em>Did I… Mishear things? Just now.</em></p>



<p><em>Goodness.</em></p>



<p>――Duplicating the skill “Fortune-Telling” with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Evolving the skill “Fortune-Telling” to “Prophecy” with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>It was then that I heard the same voice again.</p>



<p>I heard various things in rapid succession. If I could hear it so consecutively, moreover so clearly, it was no longer just me hearing things.</p>



<p><em>You don’t hear this either?</em>, and when I looked at Auxo’s face, she was still tilting her head, making a face like she couldn’t understand the situation.</p>



<p><em>Does this mean it’s something only I can hear?</em></p>



<p>“In the first place… Noblesse Oblige is too, but what’s this Fortune-Telling’ skill?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>Auxo made a reaction.</p>



<p>It was completely different from the “puzzled” reaction up until earlier.</p>



<p>“Hmm? What is it now”</p>



<p>“You said fortune-telling, but are you talking about a skill?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right… Wait a sec”</p>



<p><em>I’m pretty sure I was muttering only “Fortune-Telling.”</em></p>



<p><em>And yet, Auxo knew that it was a “Skill.”</em></p>



<p>I recalled what the voice had said.</p>



<p>“If it&#8217;s the Fortune-Telling telling… I do have it. But is there something bad about it?”</p>



<p>“You have it?”</p>



<p>“Yes…,” Auxo answered.</p>



<p>Then I pondered about it.</p>



<p><em>Think again about the content of the voice I heard earlier.</em></p>



<p><em>Duplicating Fortune-Telling, and then evolving Fortune-Telling into Prophecy.</em></p>



<p><em>To put it simply, that was the content.</em></p>



<p>“&#8230;Maybe”</p>



<p>Inside my head, a certain diagram began to emerge.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>A world where there were skills.</p>



<p>That was a definite difference from the world where I came from.</p>



<p>The humans of this world were accepting the game-like “Skills” as a matter of course.</p>



<p>And those skills were something that were quite rare.</p>



<p>In a ratio, roughly one in a hundred people possessed it.</p>



<p>Speaking of one in a hundred, it would be around the top of the school year for a school a bit on the small side.</p>



<p>If I were to say if it was small, I would say it was small. If I were to say if it was plenty, I would say it was plenty.</p>



<p>Skills were rare to that degree. However, if I were to be asked if they would make things more convenient when having it, I would say that was not the case.</p>



<p>The reason was because there were skills that were completely unusable, useless.</p>



<p>That was exactly what Auxo’s was. She possessed it, but it was not a very useful skill.</p>



<p>That was why she had such a personal history of from being sold as a slave to being a maid in this residence.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>I got down off the bed alone, leaving Auxo behind.</p>



<p>Leaving my upper body naked, I put on only my trousers.</p>



<p>I pondered about it, half naked.</p>



<p><em>Noblesse Oblige.</em></p>



<p>At first, I was wondering what was happening because it was so sudden, but after calming down and thinking about it, I remembered something.</p>



<p><em>It was something just before I was transmigrated into another world.</em></p>



<p><em>In the crowded train, I caught a glimpse of words on the screen of my glowing phone.</em></p>



<p><em>Rainbow colored skill, and that was “Noblesse Oblige”.</em></p>



<p>“If it follows the theory of transmigration into another world&#8230;”</p>



<p><em>I was transmigrated into another world, and born possessing that “Noblesse Oblige” skill.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s been seventeen years since I was transmigrated.</em></p>



<p><em>Since that moment, I’ve never seen nor heard the skill “Noblesse Oblige,” so I’ve completely forgotten about it.</em></p>



<p><em>And I heard it again.</em></p>



<p><em>It has already become something I can no longer look past ever again, because I’ve also actually experienced “another world transmigration.”</em></p>



<p>“If that’s the case, then I guess the question is how to use the skills… Auxo, what kind of thing is your ‘Fortune-Telling’?”</p>



<p>“Ah, yes! Umm, err, in my case, I use cards”</p>



<p>“Use cards?”</p>



<p>“Yes. When I do it, I can see the tomorrow’s fortune of the person I’m reading at about grade five appraisal”</p>



<p>“Does that come true?”</p>



<p>“Umm… There are times when it comes true, and also times when it doesn’t&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Uh-huh. If you always get it right, it’s more profitable being a fortune teller instead of being a maid or something after all”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… Ah, and I can also predict the weather”</p>



<p>“Ooh, the weather”</p>



<p>“Yes, I can predict the afternoon weather with about 30% chance of accuracy”</p>



<p>“That’s too inaccurate!”</p>



<p>I retorted as hard as I could, with about as fast as a spinal reflex.</p>



<p>“30% chance of predicting the weather. A farmer or fisherman would still be a lot more accurate, you know”</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry&#8230;”</p>



<p>Auxo became depressed.</p>



<p>She was not at all in fault.</p>



<p>“It’s okay, don’t mind it”</p>



<p>“Yes… Ngu!”</p>



<p>I had a feeling that she seemed to be minding it even though I had told her not to, so I raised her face up by the chin with my fingers and forcefully kissed her.</p>



<p>I made our tongues intertwined, letting myself to melt Auxo.</p>



<p>After our lips parted, I stared into her eyes.</p>



<p>“Don’t mind it,” I told her once again to remind her.</p>



<p>“Ye-yes&#8230;”</p>



<p>The feeling of sorry had disappeared from Auxo’s face, and bashfulness returned.</p>



<p><em>It’s enough about her for now, </em>I thought. Then I pondered once again.</p>



<p><em>The issue is my “Prophecy.”</em></p>



<p><em>What should I do with it? How can I use it?</em></p>



<p>At that moment, my body shone.</p>



<p>My body shone, and the light gathered in front of my body.</p>



<p>From the gathered light, letters emerged.</p>



<p>In the letters of this world, it said “Encounter: In a brothel.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Brothel, I see, this is Prophecy, huh”</p>



<p>I nodded my head.</p>



<p>It was a skill called Prophecy, but to me it looked something like a “tutorial.”</p>



<p><em>Well, it doesn’t matter either way.</em></p>



<p><em>Whether it’s Prophecy or a tutorial.</em></p>



<p><em>It doesn’t change the fact that I should act accordingly as it says, </em>I thought.</p>
