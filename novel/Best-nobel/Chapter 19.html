<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p>“I guess this is my win”</p>



<p>“Kuh&#8230;”</p>



<p>As I thrusted my sword before her throat, the kneeling Ceres grimaced.</p>



<p>Her sword dropped out of her palm.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s, my defeat”</p>



<p>“Alright. You remember the promise, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you can have me however you li――ngg!”</p>



<p>Smoothly sheathing back my sword to its scabbard, I stole a kiss from Ceres’ lips.</p>



<p>In front of me, I could see the surprised Ceres’ face.</p>



<p>Thud!</p>



<p>Ceres shoved me away.</p>



<p>“What are you doing!?”</p>



<p>“I was doing as what’s promised, though?”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“The promise was that if I won, you’d let me do whatever I liked, though?”</p>



<p>“Th-that’s… I never thought you’d do something like that!”</p>



<p>“Are you blaming others for your lack of imagination?”</p>



<p>“Kuh!”</p>



<p>Ceres grimaced again.</p>



<p>I approached Ceres once more.</p>



<p>I held her in my arms and rubbed her butt through the gap in her armor while running my tongue over her neck.</p>



<p>The straight-laced female knight’s body was nicely soft.</p>



<p>“S-stop”</p>



<p>“I won’t”</p>



<p>“Kuh… Just kill me”</p>



<p>“Ooh, hmm, hmmm”</p>



<p>I let go of Ceres, took a step back, and looked at her with scornful eyes.</p>



<p>“Wh-what”</p>



<p>“Just kill me, huh? It sounds gallant, but in other words, it’s a declaration that you’re not going to take responsibility for the words you’ve said, isn’t it?</p>



<p>“――Wha!?”</p>



<p>“Is that any different from saying, ‘I can’t keep my promise, I’m running away to the other siiiide. But since I can’t escape with my own strength, please let me run awaaay’?”</p>



<p>“Kuh&#8230;”</p>



<p>Ceres’ face contorted more and more, though in a different way than before.</p>



<p>It was the same when in a fight, but Ceres was the type of woman who would shine nicely when “cornered.”</p>



<p>It was the same with her current expression. When I saw that, I became wanting to corner her further and further.</p>



<p>“Kuh… I-I understand!”</p>



<p>“Hmmmm? What about?”</p>



<p>“I won’t go back on my words. Do as you like”</p>



<p>“And I will”</p>



<p>For the third time, I approached Ceres.</p>



<p>This time, I was kissing her while groping her body through the gap in her armor.</p>



<p>While doing so, I took her to a nearby house.</p>



<p>Although there were the manor people, I chased them out with my glance.</p>



<p>“Nn… ya&#8230;”</p>



<p>Coquettish voice escaped from Ceres’ mouth.</p>



<p>Opposite to her gallantness when in a fight, the coquettish voice that escaped her mouth was a sweet, seductive voice like that of a maiden’s.</p>



<p>Running my tongue all over, and feeling her up.</p>



<p>I continued to “open” Ceres’ body steadily.</p>



<p>“Wh-why”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Why… Are you doing this&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Is it that strange?”</p>



<p>“I mean… If you were the son of a baron, you could make love to any number of beautiful women you want, but why, me&#8230;”</p>



<p>“That’s because you’re a good woman”</p>



<p>“Y-you’re lying”</p>



<p>Ceres strongly denied it.</p>



<p>Her face turned bright red.</p>



<p>“I-I did say you can do as you like, but making fun of me at the same time is horrible!”</p>



<p>“I’m not making fun of you. I came here because I&#8217;ve heard about you. Then I met you in person, and then crossed swords. And I feel that you’re a good woman more and more. That’s why I want you”</p>



<p>“W-want&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I want to make you my woman”</p>



<p>“Hau…”</p>



<p>Ceres swooned.</p>



<p>She almost fell down, as if her body had been stripped off its bones.</p>



<p>And I caught her in my arms.</p>



<p>“Geez, seriously… Don’t make fun of me…,” Ceres said in a feeble voice, like she was pleading with me.</p>



<p>She pleaded with me, but of course I wasn’t going to grant it.</p>



<p>Again, “I’m not making fun of you. Ceres, I’m gonna make you my woman,” I whispered into her ear.</p>



<p>“Uu…”</p>



<p>“You’ve been self-deprecating for some time now, but you better stop it”</p>



<p>“Eh…”</p>



<p>“You are plenty beautiful”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hau”</p>



<p>Ceres’ face grew increasingly red.</p>



<p>“Re-really…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, for real”</p>



<p>“I-if, if you’re lying――nggu!”</p>



<p>I didn’t let her finish speaking.</p>



<p>I sealed her lips.</p>



<p>Just like at first, Ceres’ eyes opened wide at point-blank range in surprise, and her body stiffened.</p>



<p>However, this time she accepted it.</p>



<p>She closed her eyes and accepted the kiss, losing her strength.</p>



<p>I put Ceres, who was getting increasingly weak from the kiss, down on the cheap-looking bed.</p>



<p>And then, I tried to remove her armor.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Urgh”</p>



<p>It was a hard struggle.</p>



<p>I could easily unhook a hook of a bra with one hand, but this was the first time I had gotten to properly look at or touch a knight’s armor.</p>



<p>I had no idea where or what to do to take it off, and I felt like I was taking on a disentanglement puzzle where I got completely no clue of where to go.</p>



<p>“It-it’s here”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Here&#8230;”</p>



<p>While embarrassed, Ceres took my hand and guided me.</p>



<p>With her “guidance,” I unfastened the metal fittings of her armor and finally took it off.</p>



<p>Once the armor was removed, a leotard-like outfit was revealed beneath it.</p>



<p>I looked at Ceres in her leotard from, staring down at her from a kneeling position in a horse-riding position.</p>



<p>“D-don’t look”</p>



<p>“No, I’ll look”</p>



<p>“Uu… At least, somewhere dark”</p>



<p>“Nope”</p>



<p>“Kuh… Just kill mee&#8230;”</p>



<p>Different from the “Just kill me,” from earlier, it was a “Just kill me” with “weeping” in it.</p>



<p>That was why I didn’t try to corner her, and continued to gaze at her body.</p>



<p>“Such a beautiful body, there’s no way I can not look at it”</p>



<p>“Y-you said beautiful again”</p>



<p>“It really is beautiful”</p>



<p>“Hauu!”</p>

<p>I shifted the leotard, exposing Ceres’ boobs.</p>



<p>Even though she should’ve been through many battles, Ceres’ skin was beautiful without a single stain on it.</p>



<p>I sucked on that boob and rubbed the other one at the same time.</p>



<p>“Nn… Hyua!!”</p>



<p>Twitch! Ceres&#8217; body sprang up like a fish.</p>



<p>Her sensitivity was exceptional.</p>



<p>Alternating between the two boobs, I repeated to suck, rub, suck, and rub them.</p>



<p>“Uu… Why, you’re just going for my breasts”</p>



<p>I looked up, “Don’t like it?,” and asked while fixing my eyes on Ceres.</p>



<p>“Ra-rather than not liking it&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Is something like this the first for you?”</p>



<p>“Ye-yeah. I had no partner. Because there were no men around who saw me as a woman”</p>



<p>“Oh really”</p>



<p>I snickered.</p>



<p>“So you were around guys with nothing but bad eyes, huh”</p>



<p>“Eeeh!?</p>



<p>“If they had eyes to see properly, they wouldn’t have left a woman as beautiful as you alone”</p>



<p>“I-is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>I gave her a clear nod.</p>



<p><em>Well, that’s a lie.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s true that Ceres is a good woman.</em></p>



<p><em>Probably the reason she hadn’t been seduced before was because she was hard to approach.</em></p>



<p><em>She’s a talented female knight who has no gaps.</em></p>



<p><em>I suppose it’s because the people around her would’ve lost their nerves and become unable to seduce her.</em></p>



<p><em>But, there’s no such “reality.”</em></p>



<p><em>At least there’s none right now.</em></p>



<p><em>When making love to a woman, you need nothing but sweet words and compliments.</em></p>



<p>I continued on.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s a lucky thing for me, though”</p>



<p>“Lucky?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, thanks to that, it saved me the trouble of stealing you away from another man”</p>



<p>“S-stealing”</p>



<p>“If a good woman becomes someone else’s, you’ve got no choice but to steal her, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Ceres stared straight at me.</p>



<p>“Are you really, really serious?”</p>



<p>“I am”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see”</p>



<p>Ceres made a small smile.</p>



<p>Strength leaving her body in a different sense than earlier.</p>



<p>Her smile too… It turned into the softest it had been since we first met.</p>



<p>“I would never have expected anyone to say that to me”</p>



<p>“Oh yeah?”</p>



<p>“I’ve already thrown away being a woman long ago after all”</p>



<p>“How could you do such a wasteful thing like that?”</p>



<p>“Yuuto”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Can you… Make me a woman?”</p>



<p>Ceres stared at me.</p>



<p>Throwing away becoming a woman &#8212; and then becoming a woman.</p>



<p>I kissed her.</p>



<p>“Of course”</p>



<p>“Thanks,” she thanked me.</p>



<p>Then I extended my hand to her crotch.</p>



<p>I shifted the leotard, traced it with my fingers &#8212; then, “Ooh, so you have no hair.”</p>



<p>“I-is it bad? Not having it”</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh? That’s cute, too,” I told her, rubbing Ceres’ hairless secret spot.</p>



<p>I traced it with my fingers, caressing it.</p>



<p>Klish &#8212; I sunk into it up to the first joint of my fingers, making a wet sound.</p>



<p>“Nnnn!”</p>



<p>Ceres raised her voice.</p>



<p>Putting the back of her hand to her mouth, she plugged up her mouth, desperately trying to suppress her voice.</p>



<p>I relentlessly attack that place.</p>



<p>I attacked her in order from the top, but this place was where she reacted most sensitively.</p>



<p>To get even more of a reaction out of her, I continued to caress it with my fingers.</p>



<p>In a flash, her crotch was flooded.</p>



<p>“Pl-please&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Don’t bully me so much”</p>



<p>“I’m not bullying you, you know?”</p>



<p>“I-in that case――,” Ceres started to talk, but briefly stopped halfway, biting her bottom lip.</p>



<p>After an intense struggle with the embarrassment inside of her, “Don’t be mean to me, and quickly make love to me,” she said the words that followed.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Haha”</p>



<p><em>I get it now</em>.</p>



<p>“So you don’t have a knowledge of foreplay or anything like that”</p>



<p>“Foreplay?”</p>



<p>“I’ll teach it to you soon, and pillow talk as well”</p>



<p>“Foreplay… Pillow talk…?”</p>



<p>While smiling lightly, I took off my pants, and draped over Ceres.</p>



<p>“Ceres”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I’ll take it”</p>



<p>“Okay&#8230;”</p>



<p>With wet eyes, Ceres gave a small nod.</p>



<p>I zeroed in into that hairles, drenched crack &#8212; slrch!</p>



<p>“――!!”</p>



<p>There was a popping sound, and I was fully connected to Ceres.</p>




<p>――You have met the requirements for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Activating the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>I could hear the familiar voice.</p>



<p>――Duplicating the skill “Knight Armor Mastery” with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Evolving the skill “Knight Armor Mastery” to “Indomitable Knight Armor Mastery” with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>I ignored the voices that came in one after another, putting them aside for later.</p>



<p><em>Right now</em>――</p>



<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>



<p>“No, it hurts, but I’m happy. I also, can be a proper ‘woman,’ can’t I”</p>



<p>“You’re a woman from the start. And from now I&#8217;m gonna make you my woman”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Make me”</p>



<p><em>Right now it’s more important to love Ceres, who is too adorable and admirable.</em></p>
