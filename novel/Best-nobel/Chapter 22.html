<h3>Chapter 22</h3>

<p>The next morning, I left the residence with my women.</p>



<p>The two sisters, Auxo and Alice, Parthenos, and Ceres.</p>



<p>I left the residence taking the four women with me.</p>



<p>What we were riding in was a covered carriage.</p>



<p>“The-there’s a carriage like this?”</p>



<p>The one who was surprised was Alice.</p>



<p>“It’s amazing, Yuuto-sama. I believe there are only two of these covered carriages in the Mouskouri family, right?”</p>



<p>Auxo, who had a fairly long history as a maid, was deeply moved by knowing about that matter.</p>



<p>“Yeah, my dad told me to use it”</p>



<p>“How impressive… And the inside, isn’t this already like a small house”</p>



<p>Ceres was awed.</p>



<p>Even I was awed.</p>



<p>This covered carriage, I was so amazed when I first saw it.</p>



<p>It was about the size of a four-ton truck, and was being pulled by two special horses similar to draft horses.</p>



<p>Speaking of the inside, it was about the size of a one-room apartment with a bed, table, and sofa.</p>



<p>And since it was covered with a canopy, it was perfect for keeping warm when closed and for keeping air cool and ventilated when opened.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s why it’s slow, though”</p>



<p>As expected, it would be hard to pull this enormous thing.</p>



<p>Even with two draft horses, they could only manage about the same speed as people walking.</p>



<p>“How long will it take to get to the manor?,” Ceres asked.</p>



<p>“I heard it takes three days on foot, so probably around that long”</p>



<p>“Three days, huh”</p>



<p>“With this carriage, we can travel there leisurely”</p>



<p>“I guess so”</p>



<p>I looked at the four women.</p>



<p><em>Now then.</em></p>



<p><em>There’s nothing to do anyway, so let’s――</em>.</p>



<p>“<em>Neigh</em> <em>neigh</em>”</p>



<p>The horses neighed at the same time and the carriage stopped.</p>



<p>“Kyaa”</p>



<p>“Wh-wha!?”</p>



<p>“――”</p>



<p>I jumped out of the carriage.</p>



<p><em>This is clearly not a trivial thing.</em></p>



<p>When I jumped out, I found ourselves surrounded by bandits.</p>



<p>“Oh wow, that’s an unusual ride you got there, young master of a noble family”</p>



<p>“It’s not safe to ride in this thing without guards, you know?”</p>



<p>The bandits were grinning.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What do you want”</p>



<p>“Listen here, we’re not gonna do anything big either”</p>



<p>“He’s right, all’s fine and dandy if we get some toll”</p>



<p>“Toll, huh”</p>



<p>Easy to understand to an extent.</p>



<p>“Everything alright?”</p>



<p>Ceres peeked out.</p>



<p>“Ah, you’ve got one pretty lady there”</p>



<p>“Hey bro, I’ve got an idea”</p>



<p>“Oh yeah, I’ve also got the same idea”</p>



<p>“I bet”</p>



<p>“Yeah, there’s plenty of money. Let’s just take the woman here”</p>



<p>“Grr”</p>



<p>“““Yuuto-sama”””</p>



<p>“Ooh? You have plenty of them, aren’t you”</p>



<p>“Aww yeah, we’re gonna take them all!”</p>



<p>“We’re gonna give them all some loving together!”</p>



<p>The men were throwing vulgar words.</p>



<p>Some of them rocked their hips back and forth, displaying even more vulgar gestures.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hmph”</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama, I’ll handle this”</p>



<p>“That’s unnecessary”</p>



<p>I drew my sword, unleashing it.</p>



<p>I headed towards the men.</p>



<p>“Oh? Wanna have a go?”</p>



<p>“Hey hey, young master, no need to force yours――”</p>



<p>I cut him down before he could finish his words.</p>



<p>“KYAAAA”</p>



<p>“Wha!?”</p>



<p>“Bastard, don’t get ahead of yourself just because you’ve got sweet face!”</p>



<p>The men attacked me all at once.</p>



<p>“Naive”</p>



<p><em>“Indomitable Knight Armor Mastery.”</em></p>



<p>My speed was raised by it.</p>



<p>There was also a secondary-like effect at work at the same time.</p>



<p>Humans, our senses were adjusted to our own speed.</p>



<p>In short, as your speed increased, the surroundings would seem to slow down.</p>



<p>My speed doubled with “Indomitable Knight Armor Mastery.”</p>



<p>In other words, my surroundings now felt half as slow.</p>



<p>I lightly dodged them.</p>



<p>“Wha”</p>



<p>“Bastard, you just keep moving around”</p>



<p>The men lost their temper, and came to attack me some more.</p>



<p><em>Only to this extent, huh</em>.</p>



<p><em>“Flowing Longsword Mastery.”</em></p>



<p>With the skill’s excellence swordsmanship, I went on to cut down the bandits.</p>



<p>There were five of them, but I killed them all in no time.</p>



<p>I wiped the blood off my sword and sheathed it back to its scabbard.</p>



<p>“Amazing!”</p>



<p>“As expected of Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“Yu-Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Not, even a single drop of enemy’s blood is on you&#8230;”</p>



<p>Ceres was surprised.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I nearly caught some but I dodged it”</p>



<p>“Amazing&#8230;”</p>



<p>I kicked the bandits to the side.</p>



<p>I returned to the carriage with my women, and we set off again.</p>



<p>““““&#8230;””””</p>



<p>Everyone was staring at me.</p>



<p>They were staring at me with wet eyes.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>Parthenos was the first to move.</p>



<p>She hugged me and kissed me.</p>



<p>I took the kiss.</p>



<p>“What happened?,” and I asked.</p>



<p>“Seeing a cool sight of you… My body just got hot”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see”</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>Auxo and Alice were also the same. They approached me with wet pupils.</p>



<p><em>Now that it comes to this</em>.</p>



<p>“Ceres?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I’ll make love to them now, you come too”</p>



<p>“Eh… Umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Just come here”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes&#8230;”</p>



<p>I pressed her to, a bit forcefully. But instead, Ceres delightfully nodded her head.</p>



<p>I stripped them all and put them down on the bed.</p>



<p>I made the women cry one after another.</p>



<p>I inserted it into Auxo.</p>



<p>After I finished, I inserted it into the younger sister, Alice.</p>



<p>――You have met the requirements for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Activating the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama?”</p>



<p>Parthenos and Ceres, whom I hadn’t done, tilted their heads.</p>



<p>I was surprised.</p>



<p>――Restoring stamina with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p><em>Restoring stamina?</em></p>



<p><em>What does that mean?</em></p>



<p><em>….Don’t tell me.</em></p>



<p>“Parthenos”</p>



<p>“Yes”</p>



<p>Parthenos accepted me while being shy.</p>



<p>I also made Parthenos cum.</p>



<p>――You have met the requirements for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Activating the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Restoring stamina with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>I could hear the same words as earlier.</p>



<p>And then, I noticed it clearly.</p>



<p>I let out three times, but it was still alive and kicking.</p>



<p>“Ceres”</p>



<p>“P-please be gentle”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>――You have met the requirements for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Activating the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Restoring stamina with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>I could hear the same words and it continued to be alive and kicking.</p>



<p><em>&#8230;Could it be, that this is.</em></p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>Next morning.</p>



<p>I made love to Parthenos only.</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama…”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“I love you”</p>



<p>“I see, I also love you”</p>



<p>“I’m happy&#8230;”</p>



<p>Parthenos buried her face in my chest.</p>



<p>And nothing happened.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>Noon, this time, I made love to Ceres.</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama, doing it while everyone can watch is”</p>



<p>“Everyone is my women, nothing to be embarrassed about”</p>



<p>“B-but”</p>



<p>“Do you girls hate being watched?”</p>



<p>We were in a covered carriage, so the inevitable result was we could be watched.</p>



<p>Auxo and Alice looked troubled, but, “I’m not embarrassed at all,” Parthenos answered immediately.</p>



<p>“You heard her”</p>



<p>“Hey, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“We also… Rather, should we help out or anything?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine. I feel like loving you all one by one today. Auxo, Alice. I’ll take my time with you two later, okay?”</p>



<p>“Yes”</p>



<p>“Okay&#8230;”</p>



<p>They both looked down in embarrassment.</p>



<p>I made love to Ceres more.</p>



<p>I thoroughly made love to her, who was shy and said “No, no!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>Night, after everyone was asleep.</p>



<p>And after the horses were asleep as well, I went outside.</p>



<p><em>Today, I spent the whole day making love to the four of them one by one.</em></p>



<p><em>And Noblesse Oblige was not triggered.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ll have to check again tomorrow, but I have a guess.</em></p>



<p><em>If I have a threesome or more and make love to them in succession, stamina restoration comes out.</em></p>



<p><em>Noblesse Oblige.</em></p>



<p><em>Its original meaning is the duty of nobility.</em></p>



<p><em>The true nature of the nobility’s duty is to give to those who do not have.</em></p>



<p><em>And that is connected to making love to multiple women.</em></p>



<p><em>I don’t really get it, but this makes me have to build a harem more and more.</em></p>
