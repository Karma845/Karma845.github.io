<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
	
<p>After everything was done, I was giving Ceres an arm pillow.</p>



<p>While snuggling close to me, “S-say,” Ceres spoke to me.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“How was I?”</p>



<p>“How?”</p>



<p>“U-umm, like, my condition?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it was good. There’s nothing out of order in my eyes. After making love to you, I was charmed by how an increasingly good woman you are”</p>



<p>“I-I see,” Ceres said, snuggling even closer to me.</p>



<p>She snuggled to me even closer, and buried her face in my chest.</p>



<p>“By the way”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“‘Knight Armor Mastery,’ looks like that is your skill”</p>



<p>“How do you know about it?”</p>



<p>Ceres got up in a snap.</p>



<p>She sat up straight, and looked at me from above with surprised eyes.</p>



<p>“Simply put, it’s my skill”</p>



<p>“Your skill?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I understand the skill of the women I’ve made love to. I copy that skill, and make it evolve”</p>



<p>“Evolve…?”</p>



<p>“‘Indomitable Knight Armor mastery.’ It’s the skill I’ve copied from you and evolved, which then became mine”</p>



<p>“Y-you have that kind of skill?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see”</p>



<p>Ceres was surprised, then came to an understanding.</p>



<p>Lastly, she got depressed for some reason.</p>



<p>“I, see”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong”</p>



<p>“No. It’s noth――”</p>



<p>“If you’re thinking that I probably made love to you just for your skill then you’re wrong”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>Ceres was surprised.</p>



<p>“You’re really thinking that, huh”</p>



<p>“I-I mean”</p>



<p>“There’s the saying of killing two birds with one stone in this world”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Just because I’ve obtained a skill, doesn’t mean that’s a good reason to let go of a good woman”</p>



<p>“G-good woman&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I’ve been saying that since some time ago, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s… Right, but&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Looks like you still don’t believe me when I’m telling you you’re a good woman”</p>



<p>“That’s&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Alright, then I’m gonna prove it to you now”</p>



<p>“Prove it? Ho-how”</p>



<p>I kissed Ceres.</p>



<p>“Nguu!”</p>



<p>Intertwining our tongues, and making an intense sound.</p>



<p>I continued the passionate kiss until Ceres started to suffocate.</p>



<p>It was because the strong and beautiful female knight seemed to be lacking in confidence as a “woman.”</p>



<p>I continued to make love to her over and over until she believed that she herself was a beautiful and good woman.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>Next morning.</p>



<p>We went back to the city.</p>



<p>On our way there, “The skill called ‘Knight Armor Mastery,’ what kind of skill is it?,” I asked Ceres the obvious question.</p>



<p>“It makes you not feel the weight of your armor”</p>



<p>“Not feeling the weight?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. To put it in simple terms &#8212; my underwear feels heavier than this knight armor”</p>



<p>“Ooh”</p>



<p>I reached out my hands and tried to touch Ceres’ knight armor.</p>



<p>I put strength into my hands that were touching the armor she was wearing to try to lift it up.</p>



<p>I could clearly feel the weight.</p>



<p>The steel armor felt as heavy as it looked.</p>



<p>On my hands, at least.</p>



<p>“So you won’t feel this as heavy at all, huh”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“&#8230;In that case, a soldier armor obviously would――?”</p>



<p>“Uh-huh, I suppose you would normally feel the weight, which would greatly restrict your movement”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>I gave a small nod.</p>



<p>Skill “Knight Armor Mastery.”</p>



<p>According to Ceres’ explanation, it seemed only when she put on “knight armor” did the weight of the armor feel like nothing.</p>



<p>If the weight was lighter than underwear, then you might as well call it zero weight.</p>



<p>That was amazing.</p>



<p>The main disadvantage of armor was its weight.</p>



<p>Unless there was anything out of the ordinary, the weight was directly related to defensive power.</p>



<p>Therefore, if you wanted to increase your defensive power, you would end up being unable to move properly because it would be too heavy.</p>



<p>If the skill “Knight Armor mastery” reduced the weight of a knight armor to zero, you would be able to move faster than any other people wearing that same armor &#8212; the effect was practically identical to increasing your speed.</p>



<p>“It’s an amazing skill, isn’t it”</p>



<p>“That’s right. I’ve been saved by this since forever”</p>



<p>“If that’s the case, I’m getting more and more curious about this one”</p>



<p>“Indomitable… Was it?”</p>



<p>“Yea, ‘Indomitable Knight Armor Mastery.’ Let’s go, I can’t wait to try that”</p>



<p>“Okay”</p>



<p>We quickened our pace and set out to walk back to the city without making any side-trip.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>We came back to the residence.</p>



<p>Upon entering the residence, we were greeted by Melete the parlour maid.</p>



<p>“Welcome home, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“Is my dad around?”</p>



<p>“No, master is on his way to a manor different from the one you went to, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“I see, I guess I’ll just make the report later”</p>



<p>I thought for a bit, “Is there any armor like this in the residence?,” and asked Melete while raising my thumb, pointing it at Ceres.</p>



<p>“Armor… Is it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“I apologize, Yuuto-sama. I&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p><em>Well, she’s a parlour maid after all.</em></p>



<p>“Oh?, So you’re back, Yuuto”</p>



<p>“Janus”</p>



<p>Janus appeared from beyond the corner of the corridor.</p>



<p>Janus made a straight line towards here, and alternatingly looked at me and Ceres who was behind me.</p>



<p>“Looks like it went well, isn’t it”</p>



<p>“Well yeah”</p>



<p>“As expected of you”</p>



<p>“More importantly, Janus, is there any knight armor in the residence?”</p>



<p>“Knight armor?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“I wonder… If there’s any, it might be in the detached storehouse”</p>



<p>“I see. Alright, thanks,” I thanked Janus, and then turned around and began to walk.</p>



<p>We walked out of the door we had just come in through, and circled around the outside of the residence and came to the courtyard.</p>



<p>Continuing on further, I saw a line up of several storehouses.</p>



<p>Like the storehouses in a harbor, there were about ten storehouses of the same construction lined up in a row.</p>



<p>Right next to it, there was a cabin housing the person managing it.</p>



<p>When I arrived at the front of the storehouses, a person came running out of the cabin.</p>



<p>He was a middle-aged man with unshaven facial hair and disheveled hair, probably because he worked in a job where he didn’t go out in public.</p>



<p>The man came running over to me, humbling himself.</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama! Is-is there anything I can help you with?”<br>“Yeah, is there any knight armor around?”</p>



<p>“Knight armor, sir?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. One that looks like I can wear”</p>



<p>I almost said “anything” and then I rephrased it.</p>



<p>“Understood, sir! I’m going to look for it now, so could you please give me a moment?”</p>



<p>“Sure”</p>



<p>I nodded, and the man ran off towards the warehouses after taking a bundle of keys from the cabin.</p>



<p>“Really”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“Looks like you’re really the son of a noble. Since a while ago, all the servants have been humbling themselves to you”</p>



<p>Ceres stared at me with a look of being impressed on her face.</p>



<p>“Were you doubting me?”</p>



<p>“Of course. Normally, man of a noble family wouldn’t leap into the front line for the sake of a single woman”</p>



<p>“It’s because I wanted you”</p>



<p>“Uuu&#8230;”</p>



<p>Ceres blushed.</p>



<p>When Ceres, who looked so frigid in her knight armor, blushed out of embarrassment, she looked even more lovely because of the gap from her usual look.</p>



<p><em>Next time while she’s in her armor――.</em></p>



<p>“I-I have found it!”</p>



<p>A man’s voice interrupted my thoughts.</p>



<p>I looked and saw that he was coming towards us from the third storehouse, pushing a cart with a set of knight armor on it.</p>



<p>He brought it to me.</p>



<p>“Wou-would something like this be all right?”</p>



<p>“Mm-hmm”</p>



<p>I crouched down to one knee on the ground and looked at the armor on the cart.</p>



<p><em>It’s definitely “knight armor.”</em></p>



<p><em>And the size is perfect for me right now</em>.</p>



<p>“Good, I’ll be taking this”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes!”</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>Pushing the cart, we returned to the courtyard.</p>



<p>“Now then… Please give me a hand”</p>



<p>“Ah, okay”</p>



<p>Asking for Ceres’ assistance, I began to put on the knight armor.</p>



<p>I wore the knight armor in its entirety.</p>



<p>I looked at my appearance.</p>



<p><em>A seventeen year old boy.</em></p>



<p><em>Born into a noble family, I was born with a reasonable look.</em></p>



<p><em>And then, knight armor.</em></p>



<p><em>Now I found myself looking like the boy protagonist of a fantasy battle manga.</em></p>



<p><em>Yep, not bad</em>.</p>



<p>“Now then, I’m gonna do some tests with this, but please lend me a hand. Ceres”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Ceres?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ah, wh-what is it?”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? Blanking out like that”</p>



<p>“We-well&#8230;”</p>



<p>Ceres turned bright red and turned her face away.</p>



<p>“Were you captivated by me?”</p>



<p>“Urgh! Th-thats&#8230;”</p>



<p><em>I see, she’s captivated by me, huh.</em></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CVRkmc7/hdimage00014.jpg" alt="hdimage00014" border="0"></a>


<p>“Hmph&#8230;”</p>



<p>I pinched Ceres’ chin, turned her face to the front &#8212; and snatched a kiss.</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>A simple light kiss, and that made Ceres’ face redder and redder.</p>



<p>“You’re so cute, you know that?”</p>



<p>“Th-that’s not&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I’ll give you some loving later, but for now, lend me a hand”</p>



<p>“O-okay!”</p>



<p>Once I got her cooperation, I tried to move my body.</p>



<p>“I see, I certainly don’t feel the weight. It’s a strange feeling”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I was like that too at first. There’s the feeling that I’m wearing something, but it doesn’t feel heavy at all. A jacket over my everyday clothes feel much heavier”</p>



<p>“I suppose so. But&#8230;”</p>



<p>“But?</p>



<p>“If this is all there’s to it, it’s the same as your ‘Knight Armor Mastery.’ If it’s ‘Indomitable Knight Armor mastery,’ there should be something else as it’s the higher version,” I said while trying to move my body.</p>



<p><em>Is there something else? Something</em> &#8212; I moved around while focusing on various parts of my body.</p>



<p>And then.</p>



<p>“Mm”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Watch this,” I told her, and started running towards an empty space.</p>



<p>I kicked the ground and went running at full speed &#8212; it was a full-power dash.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>After running roughly fifty meters or so, I made a turn to return back to Ceres, again with a full-power dash.</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>“Did you find anything?”</p>



<p>“Just maybe. Help me remove the armor”</p>



<p>“So you’re going to compare, alright”</p>



<p>Ceres quickly guessed it.</p>



<p>Just like when putting it on, she lent me a hand, helping me take off the knight armor.</p>



<p>Completely free of the armor, I returned to my original appearance.</p>



<p>With no armor, I began to make a dash again.</p>



<p>I made a full-speed dash to the same spot, then made a turn and headed back.</p>



<p>Then I stood in front of Ceres.</p>



<p>“I knew it… It’s clearly different. Can you tell?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>Ceres gave a clear nod.</p>



<p>“When wearing the armor… You were twice as fast”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“When wearing an armor, you get faster on the contrary &#8212; that’s amazing, you know,” Ceres said.</p>



<p>I nodded my head.</p>



<p><em>Skill “Indomitable Knight Armor Mastery.”</em></p>



<p><em>This is an amazing skill.</em></p>
