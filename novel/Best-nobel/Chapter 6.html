<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p>“You sure are quite a piece”</p>



<p>After tidying up the commotion, I returned to the store I had entered at the start.</p>



<p>I could’ve also gone to the store where I saved the prostitute, but I thought it would be quicker to stick with this store, which had ties with Dimon and Nanos.</p>



<p>When I came back, the granny from earlier greeted me with a smile.</p>



<p>“That’s no big deal”</p>



<p>“You really are very different from the eldest son. I wonder how the same seed can be so different”</p>



<p>“More importantly, a woman”</p>



<p>“Ooh, yes, you&#8217;re right”</p>



<p>The granny smiled suggestively and then asked me.</p>



<p>“What kind of woman do you want, boy?”</p>



<p>“One with a skill”</p>



<p>“Oh my”</p>



<p>The granny’s eyes opened wide.</p>



<p>Her smile had vanished, and she stared at me with a surprised face.</p>



<p>“That really is an unusual request”</p>



<p><em>I guess that’s true.</em></p>



<p>A brothel. In other words, a sex industry.</p>



<p>They probably had received all sorts of requests like for faces and bodies, but they probably never have been asked for a woman with a skill.</p>



<p>In my former world, it would be like going to a sex establishment and saying something like, “I want a woman with national qualification of something.”</p>



<p><em>I guess it’s understandable she would be surprised.</em></p>



<p>“Anyone will do, but I want a woman with a skill. Do you have any?”</p>



<p>“Hmm――heeeey”</p>



<p>The granny called towards the inner part of the store.</p>



<p>After a short moment, a middle-aged person with a tidy look but lacking vigor came out.</p>



<p>Granny turned to that middle-aged person and then asked.</p>



<p>“Do we have any with a skill?”</p>



<p>“With a skill?”</p>



<p>“That’s what the customer requested”</p>



<p>After hearing what the granny said, the man frowned and looked at me doubtfully.</p>



<p>He made a face that said, “Why are you making a strange request?”</p>



<p>The man, who looked at me with such eyes, changed his expression and went into thinking.</p>



<p>“If I remember correctly &#8212; that Parthenos chick got ‘Vision Enhancement’”</p>



<p>“Are you okay with that?”</p>



<p>The granny checked this with me.</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>I replied immediately.</p>



<p>She nodded, and then signaled the man with her eyes.</p>



<p>The man guided me into the inner part of the store.</p>



<p>We entered the inner part of the store and took the stairs to the second floor.</p>



<p>Once we got up to the second floor, there was a long corridor.</p>



<p>On both sides of the corridor, there were doors at regular intervals.</p>



<p>I was being led to the front of one of the uniformed doors.</p>



<p>Then he opened the door and led me in.</p>



<p>“Ooh…”</p>



<p>The moment I entered, I couldn’t help but exclaim.</p>



<p>It was an interesting room.</p>



<p id="jump-1"><em>The layout looked like a 1LDK<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>, though on a closer look, it lacks a kitchen, so 1LD?</em> The layout of the room gave such a feeling.</p>



<p>There was a bedroom with a bed, a living room, and a dining room.</p>



<p>If each piece of furniture played its role as it should, then this room was meant to be used for relaxing as well as doing it.</p>



<p>I remembered the sex industry of my former world, the soapland.</p>



<p><em>That too also had a curious room layout with a bathtub right next to the bed.</em></p>



<p><em>My former world’s soapland and another world’s brothel.</em></p>



<p><em>I felt something similar in terms of a curious room layout.</em></p>



<p>As I was admiring the inside of that room with great interest, “Please wait a moment,” said the man. He then walked out of the room.</p>



<p>I waited for a bit as I was told. Then there was a knock, and a woman entered the room.</p>



<p>“Ooh”</p>



<p>That was my second “Ooh.”</p>



<p>It was something I didn’t expect, and it was somewhat fascinating.</p>



<p>The woman who came in was a sight for sore eyes.</p>



<p>She had long golden hair and characteristic pointed ears.</p>



<p>Furthermore, she had very beautiful white skin, and an incredibly beautiful face.</p>



<p>I had never seen one before, but I knew what she was.</p>



<div style="height:50px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><em>An elf.</em></p>



<div style="height:50px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>In this other world where I had been transmigrated, there was a race called elf, and I had only come across them once in the seventeen years of my life so far.</p>



<p>It was just a glimpse from afar of some big shot who had come to see Dimon.</p>



<p>So this was the first time I came into contact with one of them within close enough distance to actually have a conversation.</p>



<p>And that elf was wearing an elegant but sexy dress.</p>



<p>She quietly came to approach me, and then gracefully bowed from the waist.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you, I’m called Parthenos”</p>



<p>“I’m Yuuto”</p>



<p>“Umm&#8230;”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/FYsgdV1/hdimage00007.jpg" alt="hdimage00007" border="0"></a>

<p>“Hmm? What is it?”</p>



<p>“Are you fine… With me?”</p>



<p>Parthenos asked languidly.</p>



<p>There was also a feeling of timidness.</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>I nodded decisively.</p>



<p>It was obvious the “reason” of why she asked so.</p>



<p>So I asked in return.</p>



<p>“As expected, you don’t usually get that many customers?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>



<p>I nodded again.</p>



<p>To my perception as a transmigrated person, elves were straight up “beautiful” and a target that could be looked at sexually.</p>



<p>If anything, in creative works, they could be seen as sexual partners so much that they could be a single genre of their own.</p>



<p>However, it was rather the opposite in this world.</p>



<p>In this world, humans who looked at elves as a sexual target tended to be looked at coldly.</p>



<p>‘It’s weird you’re a human but lusting after an elf!’</p>



<p>Such humans were looked down upon as “Elf Fetishsist (Elfcon).”</p>



<p>If it were to be compared to my former world, it would be a nasty thing, somewhere between bestiality and lolicon.</p>



<p>She must have not gotten that many customers because of it, but it was not like there were no requests at all seeing that they could speak.</p>



<p>The elves in brothels had such a delicate position, and it was reflected in her behavior.</p>



<p><em>But well, such a thing doesn’t matter to me right now.</em></p>



<p><em>I came here to test “Noblesse Oblige.”</em></p>



<p>“I’ll ask just in case”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes”</p>



<p>“You have a skill, right?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Yes… I have ‘Vision Enhancement’”</p>



<p>“And will that make you see better?”</p>



<p>“Yes. I was able to see better when I used it, back when I was in the meadow and forest”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>I nodded.</p>



<p>To add more, the detail of the skill was not important at this stage.</p>



<p>What was important was whether she had it or not.</p>



<p>And then she got it.</p>



<p>So that was enough.</p>



<p><em>That’s enough, but</em>, “Phew, I got lucky.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“To have a woman as beautiful as you to be my partner, that is”</p>



<p>I came here for skills, but it was a happy miscalculation.</p>



<p>Parthenos was beautiful.</p>



<p>And that beautiful elf was reflected in my eyes as nothing but a beautiful woman like a fairy, literally.</p>



<p>I approached Parthenos, pulled her into my arms, and gently kissed her.</p>



<p>I pressed my lips against hers.</p>



<p>“Ngu&#8230;”</p>



<p>Parthenos jolted.</p>



<p>Her body stiffened.</p>



<p>“&#8230;?”</p>



<p>I wondered while kissing her.</p>



<p><em>She’s a prostitute… Isn’t she?</em></p>



<p><em>Why is she that inexperienced with kissing?</em></p>



<p><em>If you’re bad at this… It’s like you’re not used to it any more than my maid, Auxo, you know.</em></p>



<p><em>Is it some kind of trap, or maybe a technique?</em></p>



<p>With these thoughts in mind, I broke through Parthenos’ lips, slipped my tongue inside, and intertwined my tongue with hers.</p>



<p>Parthenos’ body stiffened even more and more, and was left at my mercy.</p>



<p><em>It really is strange.</em></p>



<p>At the same time, a deep kiss with a beautiful elf immediately made my crotch perk up.</p>



<p>Even though it was just after I had done it a number of times with Auxo an hour ago, it became energetic in an instant.</p>



<p>I stopped the kiss.</p>



<p>A sliver bridge spanned between our mouths.</p>



<p>The elf’s white skin flushed, and she leaked out a coquettish long breath.</p>



<p>“U-umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>Parthenos looked up at me with upturned eyes.</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“Please, quickly do it”</p>



<p>“Quickly? Why?”</p>



<p>I tilted my head.</p>



<p><em>It must be a type of begging, but for me to quickly do it, what a strange begging that was.</em></p>



<p>Asked by me, Parthenos replied, slightly looking down.</p>



<p>“Umm… Because there are people who decided to stop it halfway through”</p>



<p>“What, so it’s about that, huh”</p>



<p>I smiled slightly.</p>



<p><em>I guess she must’ve been getting quite the short end of the stick due to the fact she’s an elf.</em></p>



<p><em>I’m sure she must’ve been hit with an, “As expected, I’ll stop,”&nbsp; in actuality.</em></p>



<p><em>Even so, why is she working as a prostitute?</em>, and there was also such a question, but I ignored it.</p>



<p><em>She probably has her circumstances, but that doesn’t matter.</em></p>



<p><em>The Important thing is that she is right in front of me right now, waiting to be made love to by me.</em></p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll see it through till the end”</p>



<p>“B-but&#8230;”</p>



<p>“No man would be stupid enough to stop halfway with such a beautiful woman as his partner,” I said as I held Parthenos up in my arms and carried her to the bed.</p>



<p>I lowered her down onto the well-made bed and looked straight into her eyes from above.</p>



<p>Parthenos averted her eyes.</p>



<p>“M-me, beautiful is&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Don’t avert your eyes”</p>



<p>Then I made Parthenos’ face look my way half-forcibly.</p>



<p>And we stared at each other straight in the eye.</p>



<p>“Look at me”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>



<p>Parthenos nodded timidly.</p>



<p>At the same time, her negative emotions such as trepidation and confusion gradually disappeared.</p>



<p>When those were about to vanish, I kissed her again.</p>



<p>Kissing her, breaking through her lips, and letting my tongue invade.</p>



<p>And then Parthenos, who had opened up much more than before, willingly intertwined her tongue back with mine.</p>



<p>“Nn, chu&#8230;”</p>



<p>It was a kiss intense with tongue action. Parthenos also matched with me, and it was making a sticky sound.</p>



<p>While kissing, I started to take off her clothes.</p>



<p>A prostitute’s elegant but sexy dress was easy to take off.</p>



<p>Even while kissing, I was able to take it off smoothly without a problem.</p>



<p>After I finished taking off everything, I stopped kissing her and pulled away.</p>



<p>“Nn… Eh? Whe-when did you”</p>



<p>Parthenos was surprised to realize that she had been undressed.</p>



<p>Surprised, she covered her breasts with both hands.</p>



<p>Just for a little bit, I felt something off.</p>



<p>“You didn’t notice?”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I, umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. That aside, let me see more”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Move your hands away, and let me see that beautiful body of yours”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>



<p>Though Parthenos was shy, she nodded her head obediently, and slowly moved her hands away.</p>



<p>She was moving her hands away. Her body grew stiffer as she continued to become completely naked.</p>



<p>I noticed it. The true identity of the sense of discomfort.</p>



<p>“You, don’t tell me, is this your first time?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/85dqLJ9/hdimage00008.jpg" alt="hdimage00008" border="0"></a>

<p>Parthenos replied in a faint voice.</p>



<p>“I was sold three months ago, but I never got any customers&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Uhuh, what a shame. The men over here are”</p>



<p>I seriously believed so.</p>



<p><em>I do think it’s okay to like elves, </em>I thought.</p>



<p><em>First of all, I just can’t understand how they treat someone who likes elves in the same category as lolicons.</em></p>



<p><em>I can’t understand it but, well, it doesn’t matter either.</em></p>



<p><em>Thanks to that, I get to have a delicious experience, so I should be grateful instead.</em></p>



<p>“You’re beautiful”</p>



<p>“Such a me is&#8230;”</p>



<p>“It’s the truth”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>



<p>While being held down by me, Parthenos looked happy while she was red in the face.</p>



<p>Both the elf I had seen before, and Parthenos in front of me.</p>



<p>And then, even the knowledge I had of elves.</p>



<p>Elves, as a whole, were known for their slim body shape.</p>



<p>To put it in other words, they were leaning in the not-well-fleshed direction.</p>



<p>They were a race who originally lived in the forest and coexisted with nature, and were centered on a vegetable diet.</p>



<p><em>I guess they must’ve been getting a slim body shape naturally.</em></p>



<p><em>I bet there are some guys who think that slimness is something unsatisfactory when it comes to embracing.</em></p>



<p><em>There are also many guys who would say they prefer to make love to a woman on the plump side.</em></p>



<p><em>I get it. I do, but, </em>“You’re beautiful.”</p>



<p><em>It doesn’t matter in the face of this fairytale-like beauty.</em></p>



<p>I kissed Parthenos again.</p>



<p>I touched her naked body.</p>



<p>I fondled her breasts and caressed her important part.</p>



<p>It was a simultaneous three-way attack with a kiss and using both hands.</p>



<p>That seemed to come as a shock to Parthenos, who had never had a customer before and was “first time” at this.</p>



<p>She stiffened up again, and struggled on the bed, squirming.</p>



<p>Of course, I had no intention of letting her escape.</p>



<p>I attacked her lips, breasts, and crotch, with different rhythms in each of the three areas.</p>



<p>Once I had completely melted her body that way, I stepped away for a moment.</p>



<p>I got down on my knees on the bed and looked down at Parthenos.</p>



<p>“Do-don’t stop&#8230;”</p>



<p>Parthenos pleaded with a face that looked like she was about to cry.</p>



<p>“Of course, there’s no way I’m stopping after coming this far”</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Spread your legs”</p>



<p>“Yes&#8230;”</p>



<p>Parthenos nodded with a red face, and opened her thighs wide to the left and right as ordered.</p>



<p>The place that I had completely messed with was soaked in feverish heat.</p>



<p>A woman’s scent, like a thick drizzling of nectar, tickled my nostrils and aroused me even more.</p>



<p>I got on top of her.</p>



<p>And then, looking into her eyes at close range, I declared.</p>



<p>“I’m gonna take it”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>



<p>Then I thrusted out my hips.</p>



<p><em>Tear </em>&#8212; through the inside of her body, I sensed the sound of something tearing.</p>



<p>“Nn…”</p>



<p>Parthenos frowned.</p>



<p>She bit her lower lip and turned her face away, desperately trying to endure the pain.</p>



<p>I placed my hands on her face, turned her to face me, and kissed her even more.</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes… Umm”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Thank you, very much”</p>



<p>Parthenos thanked me, looking like she was happy.</p>



<p>“It’s not something you need to thank me for. Like I said before, it’s just that the men who leave a woman as beautiful as you alone are fools”</p>



<p>“That’s not it, umm… I heard from the others, that it was much more painful at first, and it’s just tough”</p>



<p>“You’re talking about that, huh”</p>



<p>“And yet… It was so warm and felt good… That’s why, thank you”</p>



<p>“The feel-good part is yet to come. I’m gonna do it, okay?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yes”</p>



<p>Parthenos nodded happily.</p>



<p>I moved my hips again.</p>



<p>I moved my hips in order to satisfy the elf who had become a woman under me.</p>
