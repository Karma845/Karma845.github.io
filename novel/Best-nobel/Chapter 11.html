<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p>The next morning.</p>



<p>I woke up and got out of my bed.</p>



<p>Then immediately, several maids came in and got me dressed.</p>



<p>I was at their mercy.</p>



<p>As I had been transmigrated as a baby to a noble family, I was used to being taken care of.</p>



<p>After all, it was so comfortable.</p>



<p>Waking up, getting out of the bed, and having my outfit all put up while I was spacing out was a wonderful thing.</p>



<p>It was honestly comfortable, and pleasant in another sense.</p>



<p>And today, I had the maids do it the same way as well.</p>



<p>After it was done, “Please excuse us,” said the maids, and left the room &#8212; however.</p>



<p>Only one of them remained.</p>



<p>Usually, all of them would have left and another maid would have immediately come to inform me that the breakfast was ready. But today, for some reason, I sensed that only one of them stayed behind.</p>



<p>When I looked in the direction of the presence I felt &#8212; Auxo was there.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re still here, huh”</p>



<p>“Yes… Umm, Yuuto-sama!”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much! Thank you very much for saving Alice!”</p>



<p>“What’s your sister doing now?”</p>



<p>“Right now she is in my room. Umm… Yuuto-sama, please allow her to say her thanks directly to you”</p>



<p>“Sure, I don’t mind”</p>



<p>I gave her a small nod.</p>



<p>Then Auxo broke into a gleeful smile.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much! I will get her right away!”</p>



<p>She then stormed out of the room.</p>



<p>She left, leaving behind a pitter patter. Three minutes hadn’t even passed and there was another pitter patter, followed by a knocking sound.</p>



<p>I, sitting back on the bed while I waited, responded in an easy going manner.</p>



<p>“Come in”</p>



<p>“Excuse me”</p>



<p>There stood Auxo in her maid’s uniform and Alice in casual clothes.</p>



<p>“Come on, Alice”</p>



<p>“Okay, onee-chan”</p>



<p>Prodded by her sister, Alice took a step forward.</p>



<p>“Umm… Thank you very much”</p>



<p>“Yeah, are you all right? Or rather, did I make it in time? Did he do anything to you?”</p>



<p>“I-I’m all right. That.. Umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>For some reason, Alice was suddenly hesitating to speak.</p>



<p>Auxo answered on Alice’s behalf.</p>



<p>“She had all kinds of seasoning smeared all over her body. Like salt, spices”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s definitely some advanced stuffs, isn’t it”</p>



<p><em>What he wanted to do by smearing her with all that was &#8212; yep, I’d better not think too deeply about it.</em></p>



<p>“Other than that?”</p>



<p>“That’s all”</p>



<p>Auxo was the one who answered for this too.</p>



<p>“I see. Glad I made it in time”</p>



<p>“Yes! I really… Really thank you very much!!”</p>



<p>“Ah… Thank you very much!”</p>



<p>After Auxo suddenly bowed her head, Alice also bowed her head, hurriedly.</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it”</p>



<p>“Umm… And so, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Would Alice be allowed to serve here together with me as well?”</p>



<p>“Oh, about that, huh. She can &#8212; no, wait”</p>



<p>“Eh? Sh-she can’t?”</p>



<p>Auxo was surprised and looked like she was about to cry.</p>



<p>“No, that’s not what I meant. There’s no problem with her working in the residence”</p>



<p>“Tha-thank you very much!”</p>



<p>Auxo bowed her head, looking happy.</p>



<p>“And… Umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>After she raised her face, this time she started to be fidgety.</p>



<p>“Hmm? What is it this time?”</p>



<p>“Umm… Cou-could Alice also receive your love, Yuuto-sama?”</p>



<p>“Aah”</p>



<p><em>So about that talk, huh</em>. I came to an understanding.</p>



<p>It was a common story in this world.</p>



<p>It was a common story where the ordinary, no, where the poor older sister married into a good place, and then she would lead her own younger sister to marry into the same place.</p>



<p>I understood Auxo’s thoughts well.</p>



<p>Her younger sister was sold to a dangerous place and almost lost her life.</p>



<p>And that younger sister already had nowhere else to go. It was a story where she then wanted to sell me a set.</p>



<p>That in itself was a totally understandable story.</p>



<p>And to be frank, up until yesterday, I would probably have accepted it with a simple “Well, sure.”</p>



<p>There was no problem in accepting Auxo, the partner I did my coming of age ceremony with, and at least her younger sister.</p>



<p>Yes, up until yesterday.</p>



<p>However, the truth was, at my coming of age ceremony yesterday, I confirmed the trigger for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>It was a skill I brought with me when I was transmigrated, which would copy the skill of the woman I made love to and evolve it further.</p>



<p>That was what was occupying 90% of my head right now.</p>



<p>Therefore, I.</p>



<p>“Alice”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes”</p>



<p>“You, do you have any kind of skill?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“A <em>skill</em>”</p>



<p>“Umm… No-no”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama… Is it not good, if she doesn’t have any skill…?”</p>



<p>Again, it was Auxo who looked like she was about to cry.</p>



<p>“Ah… I got it. I got it already, so don’t make that about to cry look”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I got it”</p>



<p>“The-then…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>I nodded.</p>



<p>To be honest, I felt affection for Auxo.</p>



<p>It was hard to say no when she did what was similar to using tears to get her way.</p>



<p><em>Well, that’s fine.</em></p>



<p><em>Alice is a cute girl, just as much as Auxo is.</em></p>



<p><em>I heard that a man’s worth changes with the times.</em></p>



<p><em>Then, I guess it’s possible to say that it changes according to the world.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s also the worth of a man of noble birth to keep her younger sister without saying a word.</em></p>



<p>“I’ll also take your younger sister. I’m gonna treat her the same way I treat you”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much!”</p>



<p>“Tha-thank you very much!”</p>



<p>“Umm, Yuuto-sama… Could she also… Service you?”</p>



<p>“Hmm? Yeah”</p>



<p><em>She’s asking me to make love to her now, huh.</em></p>



<p>I looked at Alice, not Auxo who broached the subject.</p>



<p>Alice was fidgety, and her face was completely red.</p>



<p><em>Looks like she truly understands the meaning of her older sister’s proposal.</em></p>



<p>I pondered for a bit.</p>



<p><em>I don’t have any other plans, I think it’s fine</em>.</p>



<p>“Alright, come here, Alice”</p>



<p>“Ah”</p>



<p>“Alice, do your best”</p>



<p>“Okay, onee-chan”</p>



<p>“You also come here, Auxo. Go and help your sister”</p>



<p>“Ah, yes!”</p>



<p>The two sisters came over here together.</p>



<p>They then stood right in front of me as I sat on the bed.</p>



<p>Alice had turned bright red up to the base of her ears and looked clearly nervous.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Auxo, perhaps because it was not her turn, was more serious compared to Alice, but also somewhat relaxed.</p>



<p>“I’ll ask just to make sure”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes?”</p>



<p>“Have you ever been made love to by another man?”</p>



<p>“I-I haven’t… Ah, I haven’t, I think”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Yesterday… Umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Aah”</p>



<p>I understood.</p>



<p><em>So it’s possible that man did something to her while she was unconscious, huh</em>.</p>



<p>“Then it’s fine”</p>



<p><em>That guy is “advanced.”</em></p>



<p><em>He is too advanced, he is living in another dimension.</em></p>



<p><em>Honestly, I would be fine with just pretending it never happened and forgetting about it completely.</em></p>



<p>Then I took Alice’s hand.</p>



<p>“Here I come”</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>I pulled her to me, and when she started to lose her balance, I caught her in my arms and kissed her.</p>



<p>Alice, who had been a simple village girl not that long ago, stiffened at the mere taste of a kiss.</p>



<p>Until yesterday, I hadn’t done anything like this for the first time in seventeen years. And there were also things I did poorly. But my experience with Auxo and Parthenos, the two of them, reminded me of many things.</p>



<p>After kissing her, I whispered into Alice’s ears, who was dazed.</p>



<p>“Alice”</p>



<p>“&#8230;eh?”</p>



<p>“Let me handle everything”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes&#8230;”</p>



<p>“If you hate it no matter what &#8212; bite me”</p>



<p>Then we switched places, and I pushed Alice down on the bed.</p>



<p>I kissed her again, and this time I inserted my tongue.</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I violated the inside of Alice’s mouth with everything I had.</p>



<p>Together with a sticky sound, Alice wiggled her body.</p>



<p>I stopped kissing her, and raised my face.</p>



<p>A string of saliva formed between our once connected mouth broke, and dropped on Alice’s face.</p>



<p>Her face flushed, and her breathing became ragged.</p>



<p>I turned to look at Auxo.</p>



<p>“And what would you do?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Wha-what would I do&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Want to see?”</p>



<p>“U-umm&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Onee-chan&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Alice?”</p>



<p>“I’m scared… Can you hold my hand&#8230;?”</p>



<p>“O-okay!”</p>



<p>Auxo hurriedly got up on the bed and grabbed her sister’s hand.</p>



<p>“Onee-chan…”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s alright, everything’s okay”</p>



<p>Auxo tightly grasped her sister’s hand with both of hers.</p>



<p>“Leave everything to Yuuto-sama. Yuuto-sama will make you feel so happy and fluffy”</p>



<p>“Okay&#8230;”</p>



<p>Alice nodded, then looked at me.</p>



<p>“Please, do”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>Alice’s pleading was good, but Auxo’s comforting words to her sister were even better.</p>



<p>Those were words that would fill up a man’s honor &#8212; no, a man’s self-esteem &#8212; in one shot.</p>



<p><em>Then &#8212; let’s live up to her expectations, shall we?</em></p>



<p>Then I let my fingers move around on Alice’s body, making her raise her voice.</p>



<p>I carefully and thoroughly stroke it.</p>



<p>In any case, I took my time.</p>



<p>“Nn &#8212; Aaaaaa!”</p>



<p>Suddenly, Alice’s body jolted and she began to twitch, stretching all the way down to her toes and arching her body backwards.</p>



<p>“E-eeeeh!?”</p>



<p>Auxo, who had been holding Alice’s hand the entire time I was caressing her, was surprised.</p>



<p>“Ju-just now was…?”</p>



<p>“She came”</p>



<p>“Eeeh!? Bu-but, Yuuto-sama… You still haven’t put it in, though&#8230;”</p>



<p>“You can come without having it put in, you know?”</p>



<p>“Eeeeh!? Is that true!?”</p>



<p>Alice was even more surprised.</p>



<p>Alice was still a maiden, and a commoner in another world.</p>



<p>And there was completely no sex education in this area. So she was more surprised than expected.</p>



<p>“Amazing, Yuuto-sama&#8230;”</p>



<p>She stared at me with admiring eyes, more so than I expected.</p>



<p>“Fu, of course”</p>



<p>As if she were a mother, “That’s great, isn’t it? Alice. You’re loved by Yuuto-sama,” Auxo said to Alice affectionately, while she was holding Alice’s hand.</p>



<p>“Onee-chan…”</p>



<p>“Okay. Yuuto-sama, please… Make Alice a woman”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>I gave a nod.</p>



<p>I took off the cheap linen underwear that Alice was wearing.</p>



<p>A string of thick, viscous love juice was drawn from her underwear, reflecting the morning sun in an obscene, moist way.</p>



<p>I spread her thighs to the left and right, and went to hang over her.</p>



<p>“I’ll stick it in”</p>



<p>“Okay…!!”</p>



<p>Alice nodded, and I immediately pushed out my hips.</p>



<p>Just like the time with Auxo, I felt like there was a sound of something being torn, and the entirety of my thing got inside Alice.</p>



<p>I made the younger sister a woman in front of the older sister.</p>



<p>Moreover, the other side asked me to do so.</p>



<p><em>This &#8212; I can’t stop.</em></p>



<p>It was an addictive feeling.</p>



<p>At one point, I didn’t have the intention to lay my hand on Alice, so it felt like an unexpected sense of delight and good feeling.</p>



<p>However, that was not the only unexpected thing that happened.</p>



<p>――You have met the requirements for the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Activating the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>“What!?”</p>



<p>I was surprised.</p>



<p>I could hear more of this voice.</p>




<p>――Duplicating the skill “Longsword Mastery” with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>――Evolving the skill “Longsword Mastery” to “Flowing Longsword Mastery” with the skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</p>



<p>I stared at Alice.</p>



<p>She was looking up at me in a daze, half in pain, half in pleasure.</p>



<p><em>What does this mean? Wasn’t Alice supposed to not have any skill?</em></p>



<p>And then――</p>



<p>――Awakening the skill “Longsword Mastery” with the skill “Noblesse oblige.”</p>



<p>“――!?”</p>
