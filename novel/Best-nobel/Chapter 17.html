<h3>Chapter 17</h3>

<p>“Thank you, old man. I’ll take good care of this sword,” I thanked him quite seriously.</p>



<p>I understood that the sword Balkan forged for me was definitely quite a considerable sword, so I gave him my heartfelt thanks.</p>



<p>“You bet. Forging a sword for someone who knows their stuff is a happy thing for a swordsmith, alright. There are lots of fools in this world who come to you just because of your name after all”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p><em>Well, I supposed he’s right.</em></p>



<p><em>It was like that in my former world, and I suppose it’s like that too in this other world.</em></p>



<p><em>Perhaps, it’s also like that in every world.</em></p>



<p><em>The ones who are only grateful for the “brand” of famous craftsmen.</em></p>



<p>“Then, I’ll take my leave”</p>



<p>“Sure. Oh right, give this to your father,” Balkan said, and handed me a piece of paper folded four times.</p>



<p><em>I don’t know about the content, but something was written in a somewhat poor handwriting &#8212; no, in a handwriting that shows his character.</em></p>



<p>“A letter?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“Got it, I’ll give it to him”</p>



<p>I put it in my chest pocket.</p>



<p>It was kind of interesting to see that the noble Dimon had put his into an envelope and even stamped it with a sealing wax, while Balkan’s was just a piece of paper folded four times.</p>



<p>“Well then… Aah, that’s right”</p>



<p>“Hmm? What is it?”</p>



<p>“The one from last time &#8212; right, this one”</p>



<p>I looked around the house and picked up the first sword I had chosen last time.</p>



<p>“Can I take this one?”</p>



<p>“Sure, I don’t mind but… Why?”</p>



<p>“Not to the extent of mine, but there’s a girl with a talent for swords. And I want that to girl have it”</p>



<p>“Is that so? Sure, take it”</p>



<p>“Thank you”</p>



<p>After saying my thanks one last time for all the things he had done, I left Balkan’s house.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>I walked down the mountain and came back to the city.</p>



<p>Without making a stop anywhere else, I made a straight line back to the residence.</p>



<p>When I entered the residence, I bumped into Nanos, who seemed to be just about to leave.</p>



<p>“Yuuto”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>I just gave a return nod.</p>



<p>I wanted to ignore Nanos’ “Yuuto” because there was a plain hostility in it, but since doing so would likely make things even more bothersome, I simply returned a greeting nod.</p>



<p>Nanos, who at first I thought was looking at me with hostility, “Hah!,” laughed scornfully as soon as he saw the two swords I was carrying.</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“Don’t get all carried away”</p>



<p>“Get carried away?”</p>



<p>“I’m saying don’t get all carried away just because you’ve got the swords of the renowned swordsmith Balkan. Something like that is something that any man of the Mouskouri can get”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I’ve got one of those too myself,” Nanos said, making sure to show off the ceremonial sword at his waist.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ooh, so that’s what it’s about”</p>



<p>I remembered it.</p>



<p>Balkan’s words came back to my head.</p>



<p>‘There are lots of fools in this world who come to you just because of your name after all’</p>



<p><em>I see, that’s not a generalization or anything, but he was talking about Nanos, huh.</em></p>



<p><em>By the looks of it, Nanos probably has been to Balkan’s place before.</em></p>



<p><em>And the conversation between him and Balkan at that time was… Well, I can more or less imagine it.</em></p>



<p>“What? Are you trying to be a sore loser? I’m telling you――”</p>



<p>“Oh? Yuuto, so you’re back”</p>



<p>From further inside the residence, Dimon appeared.</p>



<p>Dimon was headed straight this way.</p>



<p>Nanos seemed to be about to say something to me, but then Dimon appeared and he swallowed it at once.</p>



<p>“I see, looks like you finally got it”</p>



<p>Dimon looked at the swords I was carrying, and nodded.</p>



<p>“Yeah. Oh right, here――”</p>



<p>I took out the folded piece of paper from my chest pocket and handed it to Dimon.</p>



<p>Dimon took it and made a faint smile.</p>



<p>“He’s still the same as always”</p>



<p>Dimon, who took the letter that was folded four times &#8212; or rather, something on the level of verbal memo &#8211;, opened it and looked at the inside.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ooh”</p>



<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>



<p>“Looks like Balkan has really taken a liking to you”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“It says here he went to the trouble of forging for you”</p>



<p>“Whaaat!?”</p>



<p>Nanos to the side was surprised.</p>



<p>“W-went to the trouble… It means custom-made?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>Dimon confirmed Nanos’ question.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Nanos’ face contorted.</p>



<p>His whole body was trembling and his face turned bright red.</p>



<p>And when I thought that Nanos was glaring at me――</p>



<p>“Don’t get carried away!,” he turned away, leaving behind a sharp parting without a piece of originality.</p>



<p>Dimon and I just saw him leaving.</p>



<p>Dimon sighed.</p>



<p>“Good grief&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“That Nanos, looks like he has no clue what he’s doing”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“He is competing with you”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, I guess”</p>



<p>“He is the eldest son. He’s convincing himself that he is the heir”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p><em>&#8230;Hmm?</em></p>



<p><em>Convincing himself?</em></p>



<p>Dimon continued on, perhaps not noticing I was bothered by his words.</p>



<p>“Being the heir, that means the place he must see is outside, the enemy is outside. How can he see his brother as an enemy?”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p><em>I see, so that’s what he means.</em></p>



<p><em>Just like what Dimon said.</em></p>



<p><em>In other words, in Dimon’s eyes, it looks like Nanos voluntarily saying, “I’m not worthy to be the heir.”</em></p>



<p><em>Well… I can’t even sigh at that</em>.</p>



<p>“Well, enough of that. More importantly, Yuuto, I have a verbal message for you”</p>



<p>“For me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s from Balkan. In the unlikely chance your sword breaks, bring it to him anytime. He said he’ll fix it as many times as it takes”</p>



<p>“Aftercare, huh”</p>



<p>“Fufu, looks like he really took a liking to you. It’s not everyday that that man takes a liking to a sword user to that extent, you know?”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s an amazing thing, to say the least”</p>



<p><em>Oh, I see.</em></p>



<p><em>Well, I appreciate that</em>.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>I was in the courtyard of the residence with my women after I parted with Dimon.</p>



<p>The two sisters, Auxo and Alice, and then Parthenos.</p>



<p>They were three of my women that I had made love to since becoming an adult and performing the ceremony.</p>



<p>The sword I got from Balkan, which was the first sword I had chosen at first, I gave it to Alice.</p>



<p>“This is…?”</p>



<p>“It’s for you”</p>



<p>“Fo-for me? This!?”</p>



<p>Alice was surprised to the fullest.</p>



<p><em>Well, I suppose she would.</em></p>



<p><em>She was a girl of a farming village not that long ago.</em></p>



<p><em>Not to mention holding or seeing a longsword that could be used as a weapon like this, I’m sure she also never thought of what to do with it.</em></p>



<p><em>But, it’s different now</em>.</p>



<p>“You also have ‘Longsword Mastery’ awakened, you should at least carry one”</p>



<p>“Ah…,” Alice remembered.</p>



<p>And then… She held the sword she had received so dearly.</p>



<p>“I was given this by Yuuto-sama&#8230;”</p>



<p>“That’s great, isn’t it, Alice”</p>



<p>“Yep, onee-chan”</p>



<p>“So envious&#8230;”</p>



<p>Auxo congratulated her honestly, and Parthenos made an envious face, exactly like what she muttered.</p>



<p>“Try pulling it out”</p>



<p>“Ah, yes”</p>



<p>Then Alice hurriedly drew her sword when I told her, partly like an order.</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? Alice”</p>



<p>“This is… Kinda amazing”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“So you really can tell, huh”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes!”</p>



<p>I nodded at Alice’s response.</p>



<p><em>“Longsword Mastery.”</em></p>



<p><em>Copy and evolve, so that means, that must be the lower level of “Flowing Longsword Mastery.”</em></p>



<p><em>Which means, it’s very likely that Alice could also do what I could do and felt with “Flowing Longsword Mastery,” albeit at a lower level.</em></p>



<p><em>It&#8217;s a sword I got from Balkan, but looks like I was spot on.</em></p>



<p>“Thank you very much! Thank you very much!!”</p>



<p>Alice bowed her head to me over and over again.</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it. That aside, try swinging it. Somehow you know how, right?”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes!</p>



<p>Alice swung her sword just like I told her to.</p>



<p>Despite standing bolt-upright, her swordsmanship was quite something.</p>



<p>“Amazing… Alice….”</p>



<p>“So you could do something like this”</p>



<p>The sharpness of her swordsmanship was something amazing, even to the eyes of Auxo and Parthenos.</p>



<p>“Alice”</p>



<p>“Ye-yes”</p>



<p>“Go all out”</p>



<p>“Eh――”</p>



<p>Before Alice could process it, I drew out my sword, and unleashed a slash towards Alice</p>



<p>“Alice!?”</p>



<p>“Look out!”</p>



<p>Auxo and Parthenos shouted at the same time.</p>



<p>Alice was momentarily dazed, but quickly pulled herself together and swung her sword to counterattack.</p>



<p>A sword exchanged blows against a sword.</p>



<p>Sparks scattered in the air, and lights danced wildly between us.</p>



<p>This was the first time I swung a sword at someone since I got the skill “Flowing Longsword Mastery.”</p>



<p>My mood was raised.</p>



<p>So far, I had swung my sword and beaten some hoodlums and people like that.</p>



<p>However, this one was totally different from those.</p>



<p>It felt good.</p>



<p>I had never thought that it would feel so good to truly swing a sword.</p>



<p>After roughly having it a go, I took a step back and lowered my sword.</p>



<p>I was reluctant to, but more than this, I could end up going serious for real.</p>



<p>Setting aside if it was an enemy, but it would be bad if I ended up going serious when it was against Alice.</p>



<p>So I stopped.</p>



<p>And then, “Amazing, Yuuto-sama,” Alice spoke up.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Amazing. Strong, and beautiful. Moreover――”</p>



<p>After a short pause, “You’re not serious at all, but you’re that strong &#8212; amazing,” Alice continued, looking more and more excited.</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/cQS0ZVS/hdimage00011.jpg" alt="hdimage00011" border="0"></a>

<p>“Not, serious?”</p>



<p>The one who were surprised were Auxo and Parthenos.</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>Alice turned towards those two, and added more of it.</p>



<p>“I can tell because I have the same skill similar to Yuuto-sama’s! I was already giving it my all, but Yuuto-sama hasn’t turned serious at all yet!”</p>



<p>“Not serious… But that amazing&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Those two were dumbfounded, and little later, they stared at me with respectful eyes.</p>



<p>“Amazing, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Auxo praised me upfront, and Parthenos stared at me with passionate eyes.</p>



<p>I made a light smile.</p>



<p>Then I looked at Alice.</p>



<p>I thought back to the mock sword fight I had with Alice.</p>



<p><em>Awakened skill, evolved skill.</em></p>



<p><em>As a result of “Noblesse Oblige,” I had an expert like bout with Alice, who was just a village girl.</em></p>



<p><em>Will the next… Turn out, like this too?</em></p>



<p>“&#8230;Fufu”</p>



<p><em>Said female knight, I’m looking forward to it more and more.</em></p>
