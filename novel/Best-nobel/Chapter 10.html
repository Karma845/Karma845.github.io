<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

<p>I opened the door, and walked into the inner part of the store.</p>



<p>There were several doors, but I ignored them.</p>



<p>In any case, I continued down the corridor and found the stairs leading down at the back.</p>



<p>I headed down the stairs.</p>



<p>On the stone stairs, my boots made a thudding sound.</p>



<p>The lanterns hanging on the wall flickers as if in sync with the sound of my footsteps.</p>



<p>When I reached the bottom of the stairs, I found myself in a dungeon.</p>



<p>It looked exactly like a “prison” and was divided into several sections by iron bars.</p>



<p>“Fufufu&#8230;”</p>



<p>I heard a man’s voice.</p>



<p>I headed towards it at a fast pace.</p>



<p>And then, I found two people &#8212; a man and a girl &#8212; in an open prison cell at the furthest back.</p>



<p>The man was middle-aged, about forty years old, had swept back hair, and was wearing a subdued, fine-quality outfit.</p>



<p>He was the same type of person as Dimon, someone who looked like he could pass for a noble.</p>



<p>The other one was a very young girl.</p>



<p>This side was naked, hung from the ceiling. She was unconscious but was made to hang in a standing position.</p>



<p><em>I see, the shape of her brows and mouth resembles Auxo’s.</em></p>



<p><em>This girl is definitely her younger sister Alice.</em></p>



<p>“Let’s see, which one should I start with? Last time I started with breaking off fingers, but that scream was half-baked, wasn’t it… Let’s cut off her breasts in front of her eyes and put them up as a spice of despair”</p>



<p>In a calm voice, the man spoke of his sickening plan.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the girl didn’t seem to have been done anything yet.</p>



<p>“Hey”</p>



<p>“What? The agreement is not to come in until everything is don――”</p>



<p>“You’re disgusting so shut up”</p>



<p>“Wh-who are you? Where’s Galamoth? What happened to Galamoth!?”</p>



<p>At my entry, the man’s expression changed.</p>



<p>Just before, he had been calmly talking about his plan to “break,” but he suddenly started to panic.</p>



<p>“Go sleep for now”</p>



<p>“Wha――”</p>



<p>I kicked the floor and rushed forward.</p>



<p>While rushing at him, I drew the ceremonial sword at my waist along with its sheath and readied it to my waist.</p>



<p>I continued to close in on him, and then thrusted the front end of the sheath into the man’s solar plexus.</p>



<p>“Ga… Haa&#8230;”</p>



<p>He opened his eyes wide for a split second and immediately after that, his eyes went white and he collapsed.</p>



<p>Then I looked at Alice.</p>



<p>She was hanging from the ceiling by a chain that was about half the thickness of her arm.</p>



<p>“Hmph”</p>



<p>I drew out my ceremonial sword, launched it and clang! I hacked off the chain.</p>



<p>It was more like I tore it off than cut it, but that didn’t matter.</p>



<p>The chain broke, and I caught Alice as she was falling down.</p>



<p>“Hn… Nng”</p>



<p>“Have you woken up?”</p>



<p>“Eh… Hya”</p>



<p>Alice regained her consciousness.</p>



<p>At first she was blankly staring at me with dazed eyes, but then she suddenly realized that she was completely naked and tried to push me away.</p>



<p>“Wh-who? Just who are you?”</p>



<p>“You’re Alice, right?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Auxo asked me to come here”</p>



<p>“O-onee-chan did?”</p>



<p>“You’re definitely her younger sister, right? Then we’re getting out of here”</p>



<p>“O-okay&#8230;”</p>



<p>At first she was thoroughly on guard, but after I mentioned Auxo, she looked at the man who had collapsed and was foaming at the mouth.</p>



<p>“Did you come to… Save me?”</p>



<p>She then understood the situation.</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“Tha-thank you very much&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Hnn”</p>



<p>Then I looked around.</p>



<p>There were no clothes around, but there was a large piece of cloth that looked like a bed sheet.</p>



<p>I grabbed it and handed it to Alice.</p>



<p>“Use this to cover your body for now”</p>



<p>“Yes&#8230;”</p>



<p>Alice took it, and wrapped it on her body.</p>



<p>“Alright, then let’s go”</p>



<p>Then I turned around, taking her with me &#8212; at that moment.</p>



<p>Stomp stomp stomp! I could hear the footsteps of several people coming.</p>



<p>“Hii!”</p>



<p>Alice hid herself behind my back.</p>



<p>From upstairs, several young men came rushing in.</p>



<p>“Ho-how could this be!”</p>



<p>“Dear customer, sir! Hang on, sir”</p>



<p>“What on earth is going on? The girl ran away somewhere!”</p>



<p>“Find her!”</p>



<p>The young men who came were all acting as if they couldn’t see us.</p>



<p>“Wha-what&#8230;”</p>



<p>Alice was confused.</p>



<p>“They didn’t find us”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“They heard a commotion and came rushing in, but the culprit and the girl were nowhere to be found. They had fled”</p>



<p>“&#8230;???”</p>



<p>Alice had a bunch of question marks floating over her head.</p>



<p>I was going to add that it was that kind of “appearance,” but then I thought she probably still wouldn’t get it, so I stopped.</p>



<p><em>Galamoth is the type of merchant who is good at pro wrestling, isn’t he? </em>I was a little impressed.</p>



<p>“Anyway, we’re getting out”</p>



<p>“O-okay”</p>



<p>I took Alice up the stairs with me.</p>



<p>At the top of the stairs was Galamoth.</p>



<p>“From the start” Galamoth had been standing close to the wall, and didn’t get in the way of us coming up the stairs.</p>



<p>I went past that Galamoth, and went outside with an increasingly confused Alice with me.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>“Onee-chan!”</p>



<p>“Alice!!”</p>



<p>When we returned to the residence, Auxo, who had regained her consciousness, hugged Alice.</p>



<p>“Alice! Ah, let me take a closer look at your face, Alice. Are you hurt somewhere?”</p>



<p>“I’m not, big sis… That person saved me&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much, Yuuto-sama. Thank you very much!”</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much&#8230;”</p>



<p>Auxo bowed deeply as she thanked me.</p>



<p>She bent forward at 90 degrees angle, and tears trickled down her cheeks onto the floor.</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>From the side, a different maid spoke to me.</p>



<p>She was Melete, a parlour maid who was wearing a special and good-looking maid’s uniform among the maids.</p>



<p>A parlour maid was, in short, someone like a “receptionist.”</p>



<p>When a guest arrived, they would welcome them and guide them.</p>



<p>So in a sense, they were the “face” of the residence, and were dressed in a special maid uniform that was better-looking than a normal maid’s.</p>



<p>And that Melete bowed to me.</p>



<p>“There is a guest for you, Yuuto-sama”</p>



<p>“A guest? Who?”</p>



<p>“He calls himself Galamoth Arlington”</p>



<p>““――!!””</p>



<p>Behind me, Auxo and Alice both choked on their breath at the same time.</p>



<p>I looked behind, “Don’t worry, everything’s fine,” and said over my shoulder.</p>



<p>“Bu-but… Perhaps he came to take back Ali――”</p>



<p>“There’s no possibility of that”</p>



<p><em>If that’s the case, he wouldn’t have let me take her out in the first place, and there would be no need for him to come as a “guest.”</em></p>



<p>…</p>



<p><em>&#8230;There’s a possibility that things could get bothersome, though.</em></p>



<p>“Don’t worry, there’s not gonna be any talk of him asking me to give Alice back or anything like that”</p>



<p>“Bu-but”</p>



<p>“And that aside, go give Alice a bath. Also get her some food”</p>



<p>“Ah&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Melete, take me to him”</p>



<p>“Certainly”</p>



<p>Deciding to leave the remaining matters to Auxo, I came to the reception room guided by Melete.</p>



<p>In the reception room, there was that man from earlier &#8212; Galamoth.</p>



<p>Although there were sofas in the reception room, Galamoth was not sitting, but was standing there waiting for me.</p>



<p>“It’s an honor to meet you, Yuuto-sama. Do you remember me? Three years ago――”</p>



<p>“Enough”</p>



<p>I interrupted Galamoth mid-sentence.</p>



<p>“My dad’s teaching is very thorough. There’s no need to act all the way down in this residence”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Understood”</p>



<p>Galamoth bowed deeply.</p>



<p>“First of all… I would say that I’m very impressed”</p>



<p>“Impressed? What about?”</p>



<p>“At that time, you didn’t say anything to me, far from it, you didn’t even make eye contact with me”</p>



<p>“Aah”</p>



<p><em>He meant that, huh</em>.</p>



<p>I nodded my head and sat on the sofa.</p>



<p>Galamoth remained standing in front of me, not sitting down.</p>



<p>Something like this happened often.</p>



<p>And there were a lot of merchants who “knew” about that.</p>



<p>“There’s no way I can sit in front of you, an esteemed noble,” it was something of that sort to humble himself.</p>



<p>So I didn’t say anything about it.</p>



<p>We left it at that, with me sitting and Galamoth standing.</p>



<p>“To be so composed at that age, to put it mildly, my hat is off to you, sir”</p>



<p>“That so”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Would you not ask how the aftermath went?”</p>



<p>“You sure it’s okay to ask? I thought it would be best if I didn’t know that man’s identity, though”</p>



<p>“&#8230;As expected of you, sir”</p>



<p>“By the way, I have a request”</p>



<p>“Yes, absolutely”</p>



<p>“Do you handle proper servant slaves?”</p>



<p>“Yes”</p>



<p>“Then let me know next time you get a good one. To be specific, someone who has a skill. If I take a liking to them, I’ll buy at twice the market price”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Understood”</p>



<p>Galamoth nodded with an understanding look on his face.</p>



<p>With merchants, it should be more convenient to form a connection with them through business.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;">☆</p>



<p>At night, at Dimon’s study after Galamoth had left.</p>



<p>I was called by Dimon, and I faced him across the desk.</p>



<p>“I heard about it. Looks like you were fooling each other with a fox”</p>



<p>“Rather than fooling each other, well, we talked”</p>



<p><em>Rather, it’s more like pro-wrestling, isn’t it.</em></p>



<p>“Hmm-mm”</p>



<p>Dimon nodded.</p>



<p>“Where did you learn to do that?”</p>



<p>“I just watched you, dad. And somehow”</p>



<p>I told him something reasonable.</p>



<p><em>I can’t tell him I’m actually a transmigrated person, and learned various things from my time as a company employee after all.</em></p>



<p>“I see. Fuh, you’re really smart”</p>



<p>“Naturally”</p>



<p>I puffed out my chest.</p>



<p>I had thought I was going to get some complaining from Dimon about the incident with Galamoth, but that didn’t happen.</p>



<p>With this, the matter with Auxo&#8217;s younger sister truly came to a closure.</p>
