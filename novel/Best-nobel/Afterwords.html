<h3>Afterwords</h3>

<p>Nice to meet you everyone, or maybe it has been a while?</p>



<p>I’m Miki Nazuna, a Taiwanese light novel author.</p>



<p>Thank you very much for picking this work, “The Best Noble In Another World: The Bigger My Harem Gets, The Stronger I Become.”</p>



<p>The system you often see in games is one where you defeat enemies to gain experience, etc., which you can then use to learn new skills.</p>



<p>In this work, increasing your harem, or having sex, will give you experience, and you can learn skills.</p>



<p>Have sex → learn skill → have more skills, sex becomes easier → and increasing skills also becomes easier to do.</p>



<p>And that kind of adult version of Straw Millionaire becomes the concept of this work.</p>



<p>As with Nazuna’s other works, this is a work that adheres to the declared concept, so please pick it up with a piece of mind.</p>



<p>I will close this one here while praying to be able to deliver the continuation to everyone</p>




<p>Someday in June, 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Nazuna Miki</p>
