<h3>Chapter 14</h3>

<p>I gave Parthenos another good look.</p>



<p>I hadn’t noticed it earlier because I had prioritized saving her from Nanos, but Parthenos was wearing a maid outfit.</p>



<p>“Hey, why are you dressed like that?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah…”</p>



<p>At my question, Parthenos looked at her outfit.</p>



<p>Then her face turned red again.</p>



<p>“I was… Told to by Melete-san”</p>



<p>“Melete? Aah, the parlour maid”</p>



<p>“Yes, I was told to keep master company in this outfit”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p><em>It’s likely something Melete did out of kindness.</em></p>

<p>I had bought out Parthenos and taken her in, but I had been busy, and still undecided on how to treat her. So I left her in the hands of the maids for the time being.</p>



<p>And there, the maids dressed her in the parlour maid’s outfit, which had the best look.</p>



<p>Parlour maids were the face of the residence.</p>



<p>In many cases, the clothes were made of fabrics slightly below the rank of the noble family who owned the residence, and they also looked good.</p>



<p><em>So she’s made to put that on, and told to keep me company, huh.</em></p>



<p>I examined Parthenos.</p>



<p><em>Not bad</em>.</p>



<p><em>And it would be a shame for man not to eat when the food is so well prepared like this</em>.</p>



<p>“Parthenos”</p>



<p>“Yes?”</p>



<p>I hugged Parthenos close.</p>



<p>I put my hands around her waist and brought my face close to hers.</p>



<p>Parthenos guessed it in an instant. She then closed her eyes and lifted her face up.</p>



<p>Parthenos was completely used to kissing with me. Our lips met and our tongues entwined.</p>



<p>After kissing her, I went straight to put my arm round the back of her knees and then picked her up in princess carry.</p>



<p>While carrying her, I brought Parthenos straight into my room.</p>



<p>I went on to put her down on the bed and hung on top of her.</p>



<p>“Yuuto-sama…”</p>



<p>I kissed Parthenos again.</p>



<p>She then intensely entwined her tongue with mine.</p>



<p>Parthenos’ heart &#8212; and body.</p>



<p>They were instantly sparked.</p>



<p>“Yuuto-samaa&#8230;”</p>



<p>In a sweet voice, Parthenos called to me.</p>



<p>“I adore you… I love you”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p>“All of me belongs to you, Yuuto-sama. I’m yours and yours alone”</p>



<p>“Of course”</p>



<p>I made a light smile.</p>



<p><em>I guess it’s a confession &#8212; a vow &#8212; that comes from the fact that Nanos made a move on her earlier.</em></p>



<p>I kissed her again.</p>



<p>The third kiss. The pleasure of our intensely intertwining tongues made a direct link inside my body to my crotch.</p>



<p>Our intertwining tongues were as if they were directly connected to my crotch by a hotline, and it instantly towered over, to the point sticking to my stomach.</p>



<p>Just like the first time, I kissed her while rubbing her breasts and reaching down her skirt.</p>



<p>As I was thinking, <em>that&#8217;s the outfit of parlour maids for you, so proper and hard to take off</em>, I noticed something else.</p>



<p>“You, already wet, huh?”</p>



<p>“Tha-that’s not&#8230;”</p>



<p>“You’re so lewd, you know that?”</p>



<p>“Tha-that’s… Because it’s you, you know?…,” Parthenos said, and stared at me with reproachful eyes.</p>



<p>Such a lovely reaction made my crotch more excited.</p>



<p>I continued to hang over Parthenos, and I took it, which was towering so high it hurt, into her.</p>



<p>“Nng!”</p>



<p>Parthenos arched her body back as the shock literally pierced her body.</p>



<p>She covered her mouth with her hands to suppress her voice from leaking out.</p>



<p>I pounded her hard.</p>



<p>With each impact, Parthenos would raise her voice, but she would try her best to suppress it, perhaps out of embarrassment.</p>



<p>The more she endured it, the more she would want to raise your voice.</p>



<p>I moved my hips.</p>



<p>With just movements of my hips, I tried to remove the hands that were covering her mouth.</p>



<p>“Nng! Nnn――! Nnnnnggg――”</p>



<p>Parthenos did not remove her hands until the end.</p>



<p>She desperately kept her mouth covered. Even as her entire body was twitching after she climaxed, she continued to cover her mouth.</p>



<p>I gave a noise-making kiss on her forehead.</p>



<p>“&#8230;uu?”</p>



<p>“I’m gonna go again”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>After telling her, I moved my hips to pound her, who was still half out of it.</p>



<p>The desperately enduring elf maid was so adorable that I continued to make love to her, loving her until she lost consciousness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">☆</p>



<p>Night, at Dimon’s study.</p>



<p>I was called over, and I faced Dimon across the desk.</p>



<p>“I heard about it from Nanos”</p>



<p>When I heard Dimon’s words, I sighed.</p>



<p><em>It’s a hassle, but I can’t not explain it.</em></p>



<p><em>No choice, it’s gonna look like me tattling, but here I’ll――.</em></p>



<p>“I don’t mean to blame you. I bet it’s just Nanos coming at you anyway”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, yeah”</p>



<p>“From the moment of buying out the prostitute, I figured he’d be coming at you, but it’s really quicker than I expected”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“After his coming of age ceremony, I had him practice all sorts of things in that brothel”</p>



<p>“Ah, come to think of it, I think that granny said something like that”</p>



<p>I nodded, and recalled what the granny at the brothel had said.</p>



<p><em>She certainly did.</em></p>



<p><em>And at that time, the granny said “Even though the eldest son’s such an incompetence.”</em></p>



<p><em>&#8230;Wait, that means.</em></p>



<p>“He tried to make an appeal to the same prostitute that he could do better than me?”</p>



<p>“That’s how it is”</p>



<p>“What a child&#8230;”</p>



<p><em>No, well, he’s still only a nineteen years old child, though.</em></p>



<p>By the way, when you entered the society and then gained some experience, even the ones around university students would look like complete children.</p>



<p>Since it would be like that for university students, someone like Nanos, who was a hostility outlet and whose means was also so stupid, I could see him as nothing but a child, a “brat.”</p>



<p>“Well, I don’t care about the matter of Nanos”</p>



<p>“Okay?”</p>



<p><em>So he said…</em></p>



<p><em>Then what did you bring up that talk for?</em></p>



<p>“I heard you used some technique with the sword”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah”</p>



<p>“Is that the result of skill copying?”</p>



<p>I grasped it now.</p>



<p><em>I see, the reason you brought up the matter of Nanos is because you wanted to hear about this, huh.</em></p>



<p><em>Skill copying.</em></p>



<p><em>The effect of my transmigrated skill “Noblesse Oblige.”</em></p>



<p><em>I suppose so, Dimon must’ve been more interested in this one.</em></p>



<p>I thought for a moment, and nodded my head.</p>



<p>“Yeah, probably correct”</p>



<p>“Ooh”</p>



<p>“‘Flowing Longsword Mastery’,” I said, and pulled out the ceremonial sword on my waist.</p>



<p>Then I swung it so that the pink afterglow, which only I could see, would “shine” to the fullest inside the room.</p>



<p>The afterglow looked as if an aurora had appeared in the room.</p>



<p>That was also a technique that could be used just by holding a sword, due to the effect of the skill.</p>



<p>“Hmm certainly. Even now, I can see the extent of the skill”</p>



<p>“You can tell?”</p>



<p>“Yes. However… What’s with the, uhh, flowing?”</p>



<p>“‘Flowing Longsword Mastery’”</p>



<p>“I do know of ‘Longsword Mastery,’ but the one you just said is new to me”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>I held my chin with my fingers, and started to think.</p>



<p><em>Unlike Auxo and the other maids, Dimon is the head of a baron family that has been going for generations.</em></p>



<p><em>In this world, information is an asset. Unless you’re a foolish son like Nanos, the basics are that the higher your status and the more assets you have, proportionally to that, the more information you will gather and bring in.</em></p>



<p>I thought to myself, <em>I wonder what it means that even Dimon, the head of a baron family that has been going for generations, doesn’t know about it</em>.</p>



<p>“Dad”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Are you familiar with ‘Seeing Through?’”</p>



<p>“If it’s that, I’ve heard it before. It’s an incredibly valuable skill”</p>



<p>“I see”</p>



<p><em>An evolution of “Visual Enhancement” to “Seeing Through.”</em></p>



<p><em>An evolution of “Longsword Mastery” to “Flowing Longsword Mastery.”</em></p>



<p><em>When I think about that, I’m guessing all the skills I’m getting are of the higher ranking, and rare skills.</em></p>



<p>“I see, higher ranking skills, huh”</p>



<p>Dimon seemed to have read what I was thinking from my face.</p>



<p><em>Good, the talk is moving quickly.</em></p>



<p>“That might be what it is”</p>



<p>“If that’s really the case… Then it’s an amazing thing”</p>



<p>“I suppose so”</p>



<p>“Is that a certain thing?”</p>



<p>“No”</p>



<p>I slowly shook my head sideways.</p>



<p>Then I spoke about Alice.</p>



<p>“I was unaware that Alice had any skill. Do you truly not have it, is it just unawakened? I’d like to make that part clear”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Mm, I understand. Then you can do as you like, just like before”</p>



<p>“Okay”</p>



<p>I nodded my head.</p>



<p><em>I originally planned to do so anyway, and as long as I have Dimon’s permission, the head of the Mouskouri family, it will make things easier.</em></p>



<p>And at that moment, thud thud thud thud &#8212; knock knock!!</p>



<p>After the sound of loud footsteps and violent knocking, a man stormed into the room faster than Dimon could respond.</p>



<p>“It-it’s a disaster! Head of the family, sir”</p>



<p>“What happened?”</p>



<p>“Th-the manors. The lot in the manors are revolting and holding the place up!”</p>



<p>“What did you say!?”</p>



<p>Dimon slammed the desk, and stood up with such force that the chair was knocked over.</p>
