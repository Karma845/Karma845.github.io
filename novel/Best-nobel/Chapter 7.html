<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p>I got out of the bed, leaving the peacefully sleeping Parthenos behind.</p>



<p>The skill “Seeing Through.”</p>



<p>I copied the “Visual Enhancement” that Parthenos had, and that copy evolved.</p>



<p>It was the same thing that happened with Auxo.</p>



<p>I approached the wall.</p>



<p>Then I used the skill “Seeing Through.”</p>



<p>There was nothing happening at first, but when I got close enough that my forehead could touch it, what had been an ordinary wall became transparent as if it were a glass and I could see the other side.</p>



<p>Beyond the wall, I could see the townscape of the brothel district.</p>



<p>When I pulled my face back a little and got some distance away from it, the wall returned to being an ordinary wall and I became unable to see the other side,</p>



<p><em>I see, I can’t see through it unless I get really close, huh.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s certainly handy, but it’s a quirky skill, isn’t it.</em></p>



<p><em>Oh well, a skill is a skill.</em></p>



<p><em>Let’s think about how to put this to use later.</em></p>



<p>Then I turned around.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, on the bed, Parthenos had gotten up and was covering herself with the sheet as if she was hugging it.</p>



<p>She looked happy and sad.</p>



<p>She was making such a complicated expression.</p>



<p>“Hey, what do you plan to do now?”</p>



<p>“Eh? What I plan… To do?”</p>



<p>“Do you plan on continuing being a prostitute?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I do. I don’t have anywhere else to go after all”</p>



<p>“In that case, wanna come to my place?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>Parthenos was surprised.</p>



<p>“That… What does that mean?”</p>



<p>“Let’s change the question. To continue being a prostitute, or to become my woman, which one do you prefer?”</p>



<p>“――! I… I…”</p>



<p>Parthenos was shocked.</p>



<p>That face of hers was oozing with an unspeakable happiness.</p>



<p>Thinking that answered my question, I put on my clothes, opened the door, and called out to the outside.</p>



<p>“Is anyone there?”</p>



<p>And then the man from earlier came over.</p>



<p>“How may I help you?”</p>



<p>“I will buy her out”</p>



<p>“Eh? Uhuh&#8230;”</p>



<p>“How much?”</p>



<p>“It’s… Umm”</p>



<p>“Well, fine, where’s the granny?”</p>



<p>“Yes yes, I’m here”</p>



<p>As if she had been watching the situation, the granny suddenly showed up.</p>



<p>“I want to buy her out. I’ll go talk to my dad, so get everything ready”</p>



<p>“Understood”</p>



<p>The granny nodded.</p>



<p>I turned around, “Just wait for a bit,” and told Parthenos.</p>



<p>“Ye-yes”</p>



<p>Seeing Parthenos nodding, I set out to walk with big strides.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">☆</p>



<p>When I returned to the residence, I asked the maid who greeted me.</p>



<p>“Where’s my dad?”</p>



<p>“If it is master, he is in his study”</p>



<p>“Got it”</p>



<p>I nodded, and made my way there in big strides.</p>



<p>I arrived at his study, then knocked on the door.</p>



<p>“Come in”</p>



<p>After getting permission from Dimon, I opened the door and went inside.</p>



<p>Dimon was sitting at a fine desk, dripping wax onto an envelope and stamping a seal on it.</p>



<p>It was a sealing wax for a formal letter to be sent to an upstanding person.</p>



<p>After doing that and making sure that the wax had properly hardened, Dimon raised his face.</p>



<p>“Yuuto, huh. What’s the matter?”</p>



<p>“I have a favor to ask, dad”</p>



<p>“Ooh, what is it?”</p>



<p>“I want to buy out a prostitute”</p>



<p>“A prostitute?”</p>



<p>Dimon tilted his head.</p>



<p>“What is this about?”</p>



<p>“It’s a woman I just made love to. I want that woman”</p>



<p>“Ooh, so you immediately went to a brothel, huh”</p>



<p>Dimon put on an amused expression.</p>



<p>He looked amused at the action of his son, who immediately went to a brothel right after his coming of age ceremony.</p>



<p>“Yeah”</p>



<p>“Are you pleased with her?”</p>



<p>“There’s that too”</p>



<p>“Too?”</p>



<p>Dimon made a face that said, “What do you mean?”</p>



<p>I got closer to Dimon, took the sealed envelope in my hand, and stared at it at a point-blank range</p>



<p><em>Skill “Seeing Through.”</em></p>



<p>With Seeing Through, I could see the inside of the envelope.</p>



<p>“A letter to His Highness Lenny, huh. It’s an appeal to make next year’s expedition properly finished by winter, isn’t it”</p>



<p>“Mmm?”</p>



<p>Dimon’s expression changed. Then he took back the envelope from my hand.</p>



<p>And then just like me, he stared at the envelope at point-blank range.</p>



<p>He was staring at it, holding it up to a light, but to begin with, it was a formal envelope for an upstanding person.</p>



<p>The thickness of the material was such that you could not see through it just by holding it up to a light.</p>



<p>“How did you know?”</p>



<p>“A skill ‘Seeing Through’”</p>



<p>“Seeing through?”</p>



<p>“I learned it from embracing a woman”</p>



<p>“What does that mean?”</p>



<p>Dimon knitted his brows.</p>



<p>“I’m not certain yet, but it seems that when I make love to a woman, I would copy her skill and then make it evolve”</p>



<p>“I don’t understand what you’re saying”</p>



<p>“I’m still not sure about it either. So to do that, I want to have the women I’ve made love to nearby”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Mm-hmm”</p>



<p>Dimon held his chin with his fingers, and thought for a moment.</p>



<p>“Very well, then”</p>



<p>Dimon gave an approval.</p>



<p>He approved of me buying out Parthenos.</p>



<p>“Which brothel?”</p>



<p>“The store is――I didn’t hear the name. It’s the place where you did your ceremony”</p>



<p>“Aah”</p>



<p>Dimon gave a small nod.</p>



<p>“The woman’s name is Parthenos. She’s an elf”</p>



<p>“An elf, huh”</p>



<p>Dimon smiled amusingly.</p>



<p>“Very well, I’ll have someone to pick her up”</p>



<p>Dimon then picked up the handbell that was always kept ready on the side table and rang it.</p>



<p>Then one of the servants came in. Dimon told the servant that he would buy out an elf prostitute named Parthenos from a brothel, and sent the servant on their way.</p>



<p>In the room after the servant left and the door was closed.</p>



<p>Dimon stared straight at me.</p>



<p>“For now, it’s three people”</p>



<p>“Three people?”</p>



<p><em>What are you talking about?</em>, and I tilted my head.</p>



<p>“Whether or not you can really learn the skill of the woman you make love to. I’ll provide you money unconditionally for up to three people. Go properly confirm it”</p>



<p>“I got it, thank you”</p>



<p>I thanked him relatively earnestly.</p>



<p><em>I appreciated the all-out backing from Dimon.</em></p>



<p><em>I can do even without it, and planned to do it anyway.</em></p>



<p><em>But as expected, there&#8217;s a huge difference between having the backing of Dimon, the head of the family, and not having it.</em></p>



<p><em>Now then, what do I do next&#8230;</em></p>
