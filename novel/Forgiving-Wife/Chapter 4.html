<h3>Chapter 4 - It&#8217;s Too Early for Cohabitation </h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>1</b></p>

<p>When I went downstairs and entered the living
room, my mother and father were sitting across the table with mysterious
expressions on their faces. Then they spoke in a serious tone.</p>



<p>"Shuuji, we need to talk. Sit down."</p>



<p>I've been here before and this is the third time.</p>



<p>"Again?"</p>



<p>I have had enough of this. I knew that this time it was
about my fiancé again, but I just sat there trembling, not knowing what they
would say to me.</p>



<p>It all started with my worry after the date ended.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I was worried again. Of course, it had to do with the
fact that my fiancé was a gyaru. Until now, I had a prejudice against gyaru
extroverts. However, Miran Hanatsuki, who is both a gyaru and my fiancée, is a
kind-hearted girl. She made me lunch and showed interest in my otaku hobby.
Although I still have some confusion about being her fiancé, I hope to get to
know Miran better.</p>



<p>"Even though I think so, I don't know how to do
it."</p>



<p>That was the problem I faced. Or rather, I began to worry
about her even more after that date. On the other hand, even though the date
wasn't perfect, Miran was happy and I could also see a new side of her that was
different from the one at school. Thanks to that, I felt that we were closer
than before, but because of that, I didn't know how to interact more than
before. Apart from that, I was even more nervous in Miran's presence than
before. Like, my heart was beating irregularly.</p>



<p>That's why I couldn't communicate with Miran smoothly
lately. I don't know if it's because I'm a person who can't communicate well at
all.</p>



<p>"Huh..."</p>



<p>What actually happened to me? Also, what should I do from
now on? Should I be more proactive? But what does being proactive mean? Should
I ask her out again? How about next weekend?</p>



<p>"Hmm~"</p>



<p>I picked up the photo I took with Miran at the Game
Center from the table and looked at it. What does Miran think of our
relationship, huh? I wish we could get to know each other better, but does
Miran think so? That's an answer I won't find in a relationship guide or on the
Internet.</p>



<p>Seriously, there's so much to think about since Miran and
I became engaged. But strangely enough, I am okay with it. As I stared at the
photos, I agonizingly thought, then&#8212;</p>



<p>"Is that a photo from your last date?",
suddenly a voice from behind me startled me.</p>



<p>"Whoa. H-Hey!" I quickly put down the photo and
looked back. Sure enough, it was my mom.</p>



<p>"I knocked on your door, didn't I?" she said
before I asked, but I couldn't believe it.</p>



<p>It seems I have to lock the door! When I thought about
it, she urged me to go downstairs with a serious face.</p>



<p>"Shuuji, come down."</p>



<p>"This is... no way!"</p>



<p>It felt like déjà vu.</p>



<p>When I went downstairs and entered the living room, my
father and mother were sitting on the other side of the table with a mysterious
look on their faces, a sight I was used to.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>"Do you get along well with Miran-chan?"</p>



<p>Dad's question was as I had expected and made me sigh
inwardly.</p>



<p>"Eh, well... that's how it is."</p>



<p>I'm more worried about how to deal with him than I used
to be, but I'm still giving a safe answer for now.</p>



<p>Mom sighed sadly at me, "Since it's Shuuji... It's
not that you're more sensible than before, but you can't do a thing, can you?
You are a coward, right?".</p>



<p>"Ughhh!" I think those are exaggerated words,
but Mom is absolutely right and scares me.</p>



<p>"The parents on the other side are worried about how
you guys are interacting..." by crossing his arms and making a complicated
face, Dad looked at Mom and then said to me.</p>



<p>"After much discussion, we decided that this
holiday, we and her parents will go on a trip together."</p>



<p>Mom and Dad are going on a trip with her parents? I
tilted my head at the strange sentence and tried to confirm it.</p>



<p>"So, Miran and I will go on a trip together too,
right?"</p>



<p>"No, Shuuji and Miran will be staying here."</p>



<p>"What does that mean?"</p>



<p>I couldn't understand, but Mom said as if to clarify,
"Shuuji, while we're on vacation, you and Miran-chan will stay in this
house.".</p>



<p>I can't stand those words anymore. Um... What did Mom
say? Does that mean... Does that mean... I have to stay in this house with
Miran, just the two of us?</p>



<p>Feeling just as surprised as when they told me if I had a
fiancée, I tried to confirm it again.</p>



<p>"Stay in this house alone with Miran? Are you
serious?"</p>



<p>"Seriously. Shuuji will never be able to get over
your awkwardness for the rest of your life if we don't do this," Mom's
eyes got wet for some reason, while Dad nodded his head and said, "To grow
up, you have to move on.".</p>



<p>I shook my head in disagreement.</p>



<p>"No, what kind of move is that? This is already out
of bounds!"</p>



<p>I have been going through a lot of things lately, even
though I just went on the first date of my life. Teenage boys and girls live
under the same roof, just like in a manga or anime. This is unethical treatment.</p>



<p>"Besides, w-what if something happens?"</p>



<p>"You mean what happened?"</p>



<p>"No, it's..." I'm at a loss for words, but Mom
and Dad look very calm.</p>



<p>"We have nothing to worry about. After all, you are
Shuuji."</p>



<p>I don't know if I should be happy about their confidence.</p>



<p>"At least, just keep your own hands."</p>



<p>"Hands...?"</p>



<p>That's how our family meeting ended.</p>



<p>I expected the trip plan to be just a joke, but I found
out that they were serious. Early in the morning of the first day of holiday,
my parents actually went on a trip with Miran's parents.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>After seeing my parents leave that day&#8212;my heart pounded
as I stayed in the house. I couldn't sit still, so I carefully cleaned my room
again, as I had done many times before. I hid as many otaku items as possible
in my room that would attract attention, and decorated it with some elegant
interior items.</p>



<p>I cleaned the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, the
toilet, and all the other parts of the house. I've never cleaned like this
before, it feels like I've cleaned more than at the end of the year. However, I
don't have anything to do now because I cleaned a few days before,</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Will I stay in this house with Miran for a while?</p>



<p>When I tried to imagine what would happen in this cleaned
house, my mind couldn't picture it because I had never experienced it. There is
only a vague feeling of nervousness.</p>



<p>In the midst of such conditions, I am alone in the living
room, looking at the clock&#8212;</p>



<p>Ding-dong! The intercom rang, making my heart beat
faster.</p>



<p>"Y-Yes!"</p>



<p>I walked across the mopped floor to the front door. As I
opened the door, sunlight streamed in, revealing a beautiful girl lit up by the
sun.</p>



<p>"Yahoo!" Miran looked at me and gave a light
greeting.</p>



<p>My fiancée, who was a gyaru, looked a little
uncomfortable carrying a large bag.</p>



<p>"He-hello!" I answered awkwardly.</p>



<p>There was silence for a while.</p>



<p>"Umm... so..."</p>



<p>Not knowing what to do, Miran blushed and smiled at me.</p>



<p>"Please take care of me from today, Shuuji..."</p>



<p>"Me too," I replied very tense.</p>



<p>Maybe because she was nervous too, Miran's face looked
redder than usual. So... The life of the two of us during the holidays began.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</span></b><b><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"></span></b></span></p>



<p>I gave Miran a quick tour of the house. After showing her
the living room, kitchen, bathroom and toilet on the first floor, we went
upstairs.</p>



<p>"Where is your room Shuuji? Uww."</p>



<p>"Uhm, this one..."</p>



<p>Suddenly I was asked that and my gaze started to become
erratic.</p>



<p>Miran chuckled and went to the door of my room.</p>



<p>"Here?"</p>



<p>"Um, yes, uhm...." As I wondered how she could
know that, Miran smiled.</p>



<p>"It's clearly visible, you know? It's easy to
guess."</p>



<p>Really, I will be more careful next time. I moved and
tried to show Miran the guest room she was sleeping in, but my fiancée wouldn't
budge from the front of my room.</p>



<p>"Hey, hey, can I come in?" he asked.</p>



<p>"Eh?"</p>



<p>I had expected her to come into my room when we were
living together, but it was too soon. So I was taken aback.</p>



<p>"Can't I?"</p>



<p>Miran, her cheeks flushed, looked at me and asked. I'm
sure I tidied up my room... That's okay, right? Thinking back, I nodded my
head.</p>



<p>"Yeah, it's okay, but it's so dirty, you know?"</p>



<p>I didn't forget to warn her before.</p>



<p>"Even if it is dirty, I don't mind, really!"</p>



<p>Miran nodded curiously while I went to the door and
looked inside to make sure before I opened it.</p>



<p>"Huh, it's a nice room! Sorry to interrupt</span><span face="&quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, sans-serif" lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">&#9834;</span><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">!"</p>



<p>Miran entered the room with a smile on her face and
looked around with a curious look.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>This is the first time a girl has entered my room. I felt
really uncomfortable with the presence of a beautiful gyaru in my room, but at
the same time, I was also nervous. Really, it's nice to be able to keep my room
tidy.</p>



<p>"Shuuji usually sleeps here, huh..." Miran muttered,
tilting her head towards the stylish interior I had decorated to look good.</p>



<p>"Is this really Shuuji's hobby? I thought there
would be a lot of anime stuff or something."</p>



<p>This gyaru, so sharp!</p>



<p>By the way, I hid the otaku stuff in the cupboards and
drawers.</p>



<p>"Oh, you must have hidden them, right! You don't
have to hide them!"</p>



<p>Like just now, I almost turned my eyes to a hidden place
and hurriedly said to Miran, "I did, I did. So just forget my room, and
let's go over there! I'll take you to your room!"</p>



<p>Miran muttered to me as I asked her to leave the room.</p>



<p>"Oh, I see, we're not sleeping together, are
we?"</p>



<p>"No, we're not going to sleep together, we
shouldn't, okay!"</p>



<p>Miran laughed at my nervousness. I know it is a joke, but
it is hard for me to ignore it!</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>After showing Miran around the house&#8212;</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>We are alone in the living room now, but unlike before,
there is silence.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Usually it was Miran who talked to me, but this time she
was silent, probably because she was nervous or thinking about something. If
so, I don't even know what to do or say! I'm the King of Indoors, which is
second to none when it comes to spending time indoors, but when I'm indoors
now, I don't even know what to do.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>After the silence continued for a while&#8212;suddenly, kruuuk~
my stomach rumbled. Come to think of it, I haven't eaten since this morning! I
tried to calm my stomach right then and there, but Miran suddenly stood up as
if excited.</p>



<p>"I'm going to cook!"</p>



<p>"Eh, I'll help you too."</p>



<p>"That's okay! Shuuji can wait here."</p>



<p>Even though she said that, I felt uncomfortable if I
didn't do anything, so I followed Miran and took a look at the state of the
kitchen. Miran, who was standing in the kitchen, quickly checked the utensils
and ingredients and started cooking.</p>



<p>"So great..."</p>



<p>It was the first time I saw Miran cooking, but in fact
she was more proficient than I imagined, so I was stunned to see her. There was
no way to help her! All I could do was put the dishes away and arrange them
without disturbing Miran.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>"This is it!"</p>



<p>"Wow, it looks so delicious!"</p>



<p>The food was ready in no time, and a variety of
breakfasts with miso soup were served on the dining table.</p>



<p>"Miran, you are great!"</p>



<p>"I'm embarrassed to be praised, you know."
Miran smiled shyly as I openly complimented her.</p>



<p><i>"Itadakimasu!"</i></p>



<p>Then we clasped our hands together and began to eat,
immediately a taste that matched what we had imagined filled our mouths.</p>



<p>"It's so delicious!"</p>



<p>Hearing my comment, Miran stroked her chest in relief.</p>



<p>"Thank goodness. I was training for today."</p>



<p>"For today..."</p>



<p>"Just like the bento, I want Shuuji to enjoy a
delicious home-cooked meal."</p>



<p>"Oh, thank you..." I was so happy to hear those
words and continued to eat to quell the pounding in my chest.</p>



<p>Huh? I looked at Miran's hand and tilted my head,
noticing that her hand had stopped and she was eating almost nothing.</p>



<p>"Miran, you're not eating?"</p>



<p>"Yeah, I'm not that hungry anyway, I'm just watching
Shuuji eat."</p>



<p>"It's kind of embarrassing... But thanks for trying
so hard for me."</p>



<p>I scratched my head and thanked Miran again. With Miran
staring at me, I finished my breakfast&#8212;and then washed the dishes.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>But what should I do? I finished the dishes, and now I
feel so bored. I saw Miran sitting on the sofa in the living room, and then
something occurred to me. Should we go out? Or stay in and watch a movie? While
I was thinking about what to do, Miran turned her head and asked me.</p>



<p>"Oh yeah, can we watch that anime you told me about
when we went out?"</p>



<p>"Uhm, yes. We can watch it."</p>



<p>I have it on a video streaming app, and I also have a BD
BOX that I bought with my New Year's money. [TN: BD = Blueray Disc]</p>



<p>"If you don't mind, can I watch it?"</p>



<p>"Is it okay?" I made sure.</p>



<p>It's not hard for an otaku to show the work he likes. On
the contrary, it can be considered a gift. My question, "Is it okay?"
is to find out if it is boring for a gyaru to watch.</p>



<p>"This is Shuuji's favorite movie, right? I really
want to see it! Oh, but for Shuuji who has seen the movie once, it feels
boring, right?"</p>



<p>"No, it's not like that. I'll prepare it."</p>



<p>Otaku can watch and enjoy their favorite works as much as
they want, so such worries are completely unfounded. Once you've watched it,
it's better to buy a BD with a bonus video than to watch it again using the app.</p>



<p>With a quick thought, I went straight back to the room to
get the BD BOX I had hidden there. Then I went back to the living room and
inserted the BD into the TV player.</p>



<p>"Uwaa! The picture is so good!" when I saw
Miran exclaim happily, I became excited. So, I watched anime with her all day.</p>





<p>I can watch anime non-stop, but I don't want a beginner
to watch it all at once.</p>



<p>"I'll make you some tea."</p>



<p>"Thanks!"</p>



<p>I paused at the right moment, then went to make tea and
served it to Miran. While drinking tea, we talked about anime, schools, the
latest popular applications, and many other things. Though most of the time, I
just listened.</p>



<p>"So, Hanako had a fight with her boyfriend&#8212;"</p>



<p>"It's complicated, huh..."</p>



<p>"But you know? Three days later, they made up instead,
so Adzuki and I laughed at them."</p>



<p>While I sipped the tea, I listened to stories about
Miran's gyaru friends. When I saw my face reflected in the cup, my lips seemed
to smile wider than I had imagined. Hearing Miran talk happily gave me a sense
of comfort. Even the nervousness I felt at the beginning disappeared.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</span></b><b><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"></span></b></span></p>



<p>I thought the tension had completely subsided, but then
come the night, something happened that made my heart explode. The trigger was
something my fiancée said.</p>



<p>When the variety show we were watching together was over,
she stretched her body and said, "It looks like I have to take a shower
soon....".</p>



<p>Ah, it's time, huh? I almost replied with those words,
but one word stuck in my mind. Bath?! Really? She is going to take a bath in this
house, right? A bad feeling like smoke rose in my mind, and then I quickly
shook my head to get rid of it.</p>



<p>"I'll heat the water first!" I was so aware of
it that I only responded with that sentence.</p>



<p>When I went to the bathroom as if nothing had happened,
Miran blurted out this question, </p>



<p>"Does Shuuji want to join me?"</p>



<p>"Eh!?"</p>



<p>She's also stunned by my tense reaction.</p>



<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOYYF2vsK01Pwci4CGBO-FVv_eJgTz5vtWzS6URMiWjquxgO2-2BAfwbNSQlkiCgVujb1gThZoZ1HSX48hxq2hYre2fH0Nn86bXmKHbPPGSnbPqErvLwZJ2qfiX6czCuZEGLHiLktdpd_KZWBYNpALrWpua0CVBMb_rYtjkD_7DU3EfHdjQCWJ-EXYUw/s2248/out%20(15).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2248" data-original-width="1596" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOYYF2vsK01Pwci4CGBO-FVv_eJgTz5vtWzS6URMiWjquxgO2-2BAfwbNSQlkiCgVujb1gThZoZ1HSX48hxq2hYre2fH0Nn86bXmKHbPPGSnbPqErvLwZJ2qfiX6czCuZEGLHiLktdpd_KZWBYNpALrWpua0CVBMb_rYtjkD_7DU3EfHdjQCWJ-EXYUw/s16000/out%20(15).png" /></a></span></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"><p></p>



<p>"What the heck. I'm just kidding, you know!"</p>



<p>"Ha-ha-ha-ha, of course I know that," I also
laughed for a while.</p>



<p>"Or do you really want to go in with me?" Miran
asked looking at me. The sight of her blushing face almost made my heart
explode, but this time I stood my ground.</p>



<p>"Again, you must be joking, right? I'll heat the
water for the bath."</p>



<p>I left the living room and went to heat the water with
shaking legs. After a while, the water in the bathtub was warm.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Now I'm so nervous and tense. The reason for this was the
sound of the water and the faint humming in the bathroom.</p>



<p>"At this time, Miran is taking a bath&#8212;"</p>



<p>Actually, Miran was taking a shower right now, but every
time the sound from the bathroom reaches my ears, I can't help but feel this
uneasy feeling. I try to block it out with the TV or other noises, but it is
only at times like this that my hearing becomes too sharp to pick up the sound
clearly. When the sound of the shower started, I finally almost imagined Miran
taking a shower. To avoid the thought, I shook my head and said some numbers.</p>



<p>"3.1415926535 ... 8979323846 ... 2643383279&#8212;"</p>




<p>Phi! To relieve my anxiety, I searched for phi on my
smartphone and frantically memorized it. It is quite effective and is able to
get rid of the anxiety for a while. However, I'm reminded of a theory I learned
on TV back then, that phi includes all the sequences of number in the world&#8212;if
that's the case, does it include three Miran measures? After thinking about it,
I got stuck again. I repeated the fierce struggle over and over again for I
don't know how long.</p>



<p>"Shuuji, I have finished, here!"</p>



<p>Miran, who had just finished showering, returned to the
living room. I was fascinated by Miran's different appearance. I've only ever
seen her in her school uniform and casual clothes when she goes out on the
street, but after a shower she looks so vulnerable in her home clothes.</p>



<p>"I bought new home clothes, what do you think?"</p>



<p>"Yes, I think... it's cute."</p>



<p>"Thanks</span><span face="&quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, sans-serif" lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">&#9834;</span><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">."</p>



<p>Although her skin was not exposed, her curves were
clearly visible through her clothes. This made me feel embarrassed and I
lowered my head when I looked at her.</p>



<p>"I'm tired today, so I'll go to bed first."</p>



<p>"Oh, have a good sleep. I will also sleep after I
take a shower." As I said good night, I went to the bathroom.</p>



<p>I looked into the bathroom and wondered if Miran was here
just now. Then I tried hard not to imagine that, because my worries started to
rage again. For the first time in my life, I felt nervous about taking a
shower. Without taking too much time, I quickly left the bathroom and returned
to my room.</p>

<p>Miran and I are in separate rooms, of course. Lying in
bed&#8212;I couldn't fall asleep because I kept thinking about the fact that there
was a girl sleeping under the same roof as me&#8212;added to my anxiety.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>2</b></p>

<p>Then the second day of awkward and exciting cohabitation
began.</p>



<p>I woke up early because I couldn't sleep well, cleaned up
in the bathroom and went to the living room to calm down. A day had passed, but
I still found it strange that Miran was sleeping in this house. I heard
footsteps coming down the stairs as I drifted into a daydream, thinking about
what I was going to do today.</p>



<p>Just as I thought Miran was peeking into the living room,
she greeted me with a surprised look when she saw that I was awake.</p>



<p>"Good morning! Shuuji, you woke up so early!"</p>



<p>"Oh, good morning, I just happened to wake up
early."</p>



<p>It is so embarrassing to say that I am so restless to be
able to sleep well. I scratched my head and stared at Miran. Her hair is
slightly fluffy and her home clothes are also loose. I always see her looking
so neat, so it's new for me to see her a little messy when she wakes up.</p>



<p>"Hey, don't look at me like that, I just woke
up!"</p>



<p>"S-Sorry...!"</p>



<p>Miran covered her face and hid from the living room in
embarrassment, then ran to the bathroom. When she came back a little later,
Miran looked as elegant as ever.</p>



<p>"I'll make breakfast, okay..." Miran said.</p>



<p>Then she quickly made breakfast. The breakfast she made
looked good and very tasty, but the person who made it didn't eat much like
yesterday, so I got a little worried.</p>



<p>"Miran, are you okay?"</p>



<p>"Yup, I'm fine! I'm just on a diet!"</p>



<p>Miran waved her hand happily and asked me, "By the
way, what are you going to do today?".</p>



<p>"What do you want to do, huh? Do you have any
plans?"</p>



<p>"Well, maybe I want to watch the continuation of
yesterday's anime."</p>



<p>"Um, yeah, that sounds good." I nodded my head,
but at the same time I didn't expect it, because I imagined Miran as a person
who likes to do outdoor activities.</p>



<p>However, as an otaku, I was very interested in the
content of her plan, and we started watching the continuation of the anime as
we did yesterday.</p>





<p>We finished watching all the anime after lunch, and then
we discussed our impressions and listened to the stories of Miran's gyaru
friends.</p>



<p>At that time, I went with Miran to a nearby supermarket
to buy food.</p>



<p>"It feels like a real married couple, huh?"</p>



<p>Miran giggled as we walked home, carrying the grocery
bags in one of her hands. Is it Miran's face that is flushed from embarrassment
or from being exposed to the setting sun?</p>



<p>The words are very outrageous, but considering my current
state of confusion, I can only nod my head.</p>



<p>"Yes, that's right..."</p>



<p>I thought that Gyaru, the extroverted otaku, and I, the
introverted otaku, would never meet. However, in the name of
"fiancée", we end up together in a confusing way. But before I knew
it, there was a part of me that felt comfortable with Miran.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Do I like Miran? I've never really fallen in love with a
three-dimensional being before, and I don't really understand what I'm feeling.
However, I have a strong desire to get to know her better.</p>



<p>"----"</p>



<p>Miran's empty hands caught my eye.</p>

<p>Will I find out something if I take her hand?</p>



<p>"What is it?"</p>



<p>"No, nothing!"</p>



<p>I don't have the courage to take her hand! If I had the
courage, I wouldn't have always been a loner. After confirming my current
feelings for Miran and realizing my weakness, I began to think of another
thing&#8212;Miran seemed to have no appetite. It has been like that since yesterday,
and she only ate a little rice.</p>



<p>We've already gone shopping, so there's a sumptuous meal
on the table. But the person who cooked it only ate a little.</p>



<p>"Miran, you didn't eat properly, are you sure you're
okay?"</p>



<p>"Yes. I was so full." Miran smiled at me.</p>



<p>Her face was red, but I didn't notice because she was
acting like she always did when she is outside.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</span></b><b><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"></span></b></span></p>



<p>The next morning....</p>



<p>"Miran?" I knocked on the door.</p>



<p>I was worried because Miran hadn't woken up at all, so I
came to check.</p>



<p>"Miran, are you awake? I'll open the door&#8212;?"</p>



<p>On the contrary, there was no answer to my call. Then I
cautiously opened the door and looked into the room and was surprised to see
Miran lying on the bed.</p>



<p>"Miran&#8212;?"</p>



<p>"Huh, huh..." Miran gasped as if she was in
pain.</p>



<p>She let out a soft apologetic voice as I hurried over to
her.</p>



<p>"Huh, huh... Shuuji... I'm sorry..."</p>



<p>"Miran, I'm going to touch you a little."
Miran's face flushed and I touched her forehead.</p>



<p>"So hot! You have a fever!"</p>



<p>The fever is so high that I don't even need a
thermometer.</p>



<p>W-What should I do?</p>



<p>I almost panicked when I saw my fiancée in pain&#8212;but I
forcefully slapped both of my cheeks to keep calm.</p>



<p>Calm down, me! Now there's no parents around, which means
I have to do something. Thinking calmly. Then I called a taxi right away and
took Miran to the hospital.</p>





<p>The diagnosis was a cold. After getting the medicine, I
took Miran home, put her to bed, and immediately called her parents.</p>



<p>"I don't know what to do. I'm so freaked out right
now."</p>



<p>There was a feeling of wanting to blame myself for my
insensitivity. Because there are so many ways to notice that Miran is not
feeling well. Obviously she had no appetite, seemed less active than usual, and
her face was flushed. In the end, I didn't notice it until it happened. I can't
take care of her.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>There is a feeling of not being worthy of being her
fiancée. I'm desperate, but I can't stay like this. I have to take care of
Miran. I&#8212;</p>



<p>"Miran, I made you some porridge, here. Let's eat a
little and then we'll take the medicine."</p>



<p>I went to Miran's room with the porridge I made from the
recipe I found on the Internet. She, who was lying down with a tired look on
her face, said again apologetically.</p>



<p>"Sorry, Shuuji."</p>



<p>"You don't have to apologize, okay? On the contrary,
I am the one who should apologize for not catching it."</p>



<p>"Although... I'm already looking forward to staying
with Shuuji... but it became like this instead." Miran, who had a fever,
felt sad.</p>



<p>Then, I sat on the edge of the bed next to Miran with all
kinds of emotions overflowing, there was a feeling of happiness as well as
guilt when I heard her words.</p>



<p>"Miran, here. Can you eat it? Ahn~."</p>



<p>I didn't want to do this and even now I was filled with
shame. But then I blew the porridge and put it into Miran's mouth.</p>



<p>"S-Shuuji?" Miran was surprised, but when I
continued to offer it, she ate it shyly, "Ah, ahn," she said.</p>



<p>After feeding her the porridge, I said with
determination.</p>



<p>"It seems that our parents can't go home yet, so
I'll take good care of Miran until they do. Don't worry."</p>



<p>"Shuuji...&#8221;</p>



<p>I smiled and said to Miran, who had a guilty look on her
face, "Don't worry. I should do something like a fiancee."</p>



<p>Although I said such firm words, I still felt embarrassed
and couldn't look at Miran's face. Then I continued to feed Miran, give her
medicine, and change her fever patch. I'll do everything I can.</p>



<p>"I want to wipe my sweat..." Miran said in a
whisper.</p>



<p>Seeing her sweating so much, I hurried to get her a
towel, "I brought you a towel," I said.</p>



<p>"T-Thank you..."</p>



<p>I gave it to Miran, but she seemed to have trouble getting
up and wiping herself. So I said, </p>



<p>"Let me&#8212;"</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">Let me wipe it?</span></i><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;"> The sentence was almost spoken,
but I quickly stopped myself. Miran's pajamas were soaked with sweat and stuck
to her skin, revealing her curves. My eyes, realizing this, began to sparkle. I
realized it was inappropriate to look like that at a helpless person. But I
couldn't look away from Miran's sweat-soaked body. Although I have no malice,
only a desire to wipe his sweat, I hesitate to offer help. Wiping her sweat is
beyond my capabilities.</p>



<p>I came to such a conclusion&#8212;but looking at the helpless
Miran, I subconsciously said, "Well, let me wipe it for you".</p>



<p>"Sorry... But thanks, really."</p>



<p>Later Miran gave me a towel. Since she has decided, I
have to do it seriously. Ignoring my thoughts, I wiped her forehead first, then
her face. When it turned to her neck, my heart began to pound as it touched her
soft rosy skin, but I tried hard to ignore it. My body clearly felt the
sensation, so I withdrew my hand in doubt&#8212;then Miran said,</p>



<p>"My front is okay now, so please wipe my back as
well, okay?"</p>



<p>"Y-Your back?" I'm surprised.</p>



<p>Miran, who looked dazed, turned her back to me and then
slowly began to remove her pajamas.</p>



<p>"----!?"</p>



<p>Miran's bare back almost made my face burn. There are
voluptuous shoulders and waist that I usually can't see. There is also an
elongated back, and her sweaty white skin is so seductive&#8212;</p>



<p>A-Am I going to wipe this back now? As my gaze wandered,
the course of my mind was chaotic, and I fell silent standing there, then I
heard&#8212;</p>



<p>"Hatsyi!" It dawned on me as Miran sneezed.</p>



<p>I had to wipe her quickly so she wouldn't get cold.
Dazed, I wiped her back with a towel. The back of the girl who was my fiancée
turned out to be hotter and also slimmer than I had imagined. I could feel it
from the touch of the towel. Although my heart was pounding, on the other hand,
I felt anxious knowing that Miran was still weak due to the heat of the towel.</p>



<p>"T-Then I'll leave a change of clothes for you. Just
call me if you need anything."</p>



<p>"Thank you, Shuuji..."</p>



<p>After I finished wiping her back, I looked away and
handed Miran a towel. I felt like my common sense would lose control if I
stayed here any longer in a situation like this and that's why I left the room
immediately.</p>

<p>Then I spent the rest of the day taking care of Miran,
and without realizing it, night had fallen.</p>



<p>"I'm going back to my room now."</p>



<p>"Wait, Shuuji." When I was about to go back to
my room, Miran stopped me.</p>



<p>"W-What's wrong?" I asked.</p>



<p>When I turned my head, Miran said like a complaining
child, "I'm lonely... and I want you to stay with me until I fall
asleep".</p>



<p>"All right."</p>



<p>She was so cute, even though it wasn't a proper thing to
do, and I sat on the edge of her bed with a smile.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>However, should I do something for her until she falls
asleep? As I thought about it, Miran asked me for help.</p>



<p>"Hey, do you want to tell me about your favorite
anime, Shuuji?"</p>



<p>"B-But it's not fun to listen to that, right?"</p>



<p>"I like it, you know... seeing Shuuji talking about
what he likes."</p>



<p>"Eh, r-really? Um, then..."</p>



<p>Well, then I started telling stories about anime, as well
as my impressions of them, slowly so as not to disturb Miran's sleep.</p>



<p>"That's why I think the world is spinning... Miran?
Are you asleep?"</p>



<p>I was so passionate that I kept talking without noticing
that Miran had fallen asleep.</p>



<p>"Ha... ha..."</p>



<p>Still, Miran's breathing was ragged as she fell asleep.
Seeing her suffering, I said, "Get well soon, okay..." and gently
held her hand. My fiancée's hands, which were so hot, turned out to be smaller
than I had imagined. As I continued to hold her hand, I hoped that she would
get better soon.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</span></b><b><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"></span></b></span></p>



<p>"&#8212;Haa!"</p>



<p>Oh God, I'm asleep!</p>



<p>Instantly realizing that I had fallen asleep, I raised my
face only to see the morning light shining into my eyes.</p>



<p>"Shuuji, good morning."</p>



<p>I blinked and saw Miran smiling as she sat down.</p>



<p>Thankfully... She looks much better now!</p>



<p>"Good morning&#8212;eh!"</p>



<p>Relieved, I noticed the sensation in my hand too late. It
felt a little hot because I'd been holding something slender all the time&#8212;and I
saw that it was my fiancée's hand. Remembering what happened before I fell
asleep, I panicked.</p>



<p>"S-S-Sorry!" I quickly tried to pull my hand
away, but she squeezed it tightly instead.</p>



<p>"It's fine to stay like this, okay."</p>



<p>Miran, who was holding my hand, mumbled with emotion.
"Shuuji's hand... softer and bigger than I imagined, anyway".</p>



<p>My heart was beating faster with excitement. Because
Miran squeezed my hand tightly, making the feeling of her hand spread to my
palm again. I'm curious if my hands are sweating!</p>



<p>This is my bad habit of thinking too much.</p>



<p>"Miran's hands are soft and slender" I replied,
but said it embarrassed as I lowered my head.</p>



<p>Afterwards, Miran thanked me with a happy look on her
face, "Thank you for taking care of me yesterday" she said.</p>



<p>"I'm glad you're okay now..."</p>



<p>Happy that Miran was feeling better, I took her hands
again.</p>



<p>"Can we keep holding hands like this for a
while?" Miran asked happily, while I shyly agreed.</p>



<p>After that, we continued holding hands for a while.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</span></b><b><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"></span></b></span></p>



<p>When Miran caught the fever, our parents had to cut their
trip short and return home. It was the end of our life together. When Miran
heard the news, she looked unhappy.</p>



<p>"I want to go out with you before this thing is
over." Miran said to me on the bed, to which I replied with a gasp,
"You can't, you're still sick".</p>



<p>"I want to go with you... Just a minute." Miran
whines like a child.</p>



<p>She was a popular gyaru in school, but now she's very
different from her usual impression, which makes me laugh.</p>



<p>"Why are you laughing?" she asked.</p>



<p>"No, nothing."</p>



<p>"Hey, it's okay, right, Shuuji?" Miran looked
at me seriously.</p>



<p>I couldn't help but let out a small sigh as those round,
beautiful eyes stared at me, "Well, we can if we just walk around here".</p>



<p>"Yatta!" Miran immediately got up from the bed,
but I quickly supported her because her body was unsteady and she almost fell
over.</p>



<p>"Obviously you are still weak now. That means, next
time." I said.</p>



<p>"Then give me a piggyback, okay?"</p>



<p>I panicked as a whisper reached my ear.</p>



<p>"P-Piggyback!? You really want to go out, huh?"</p>



<p>It was an unthinkable idea for someone like me, who was
often indoors.</p>



<p>"Sorry, I'm just kidding, really. Then I'll be
patient." Miran returned to bed feeling sad.</p>



<p>In fact, she had never gone out before, except for
shopping and going to the hospital. So I, who wanted to fulfill Miran's wish
before this was over, suppressed my embarrassment and said, "I'll give you
a piggyback".</p>





<p>I walked around the house holding Miran who was dressed
in thick clothes to keep her warm on my back. It had been a question of how
people would look at us, but I don't have time to think about that now. With
Miran's soft object pressing against my back and the feeling of her thighs
hitting my hands and arms, I am actually more focused on calculating the phi
value in my heart.</p>



<p>"Actually, Shuuji is tall, right?"</p>



<p>"That's because I usually look down a lot."</p>



<p>The feeling of being tickled by Miran's voice that
sounded close to me, I continued walking in the bright sun. I don't know what
could have been the cause, because I was carrying Miran, I felt that going
outside was not a bad thing. In fact, I am the king of indoors. After walking
around the house, I asked Miran who was on my back.</p>



<p>"How? Are you satisfied now?"</p>



<p>"Yup, I'm satisfied!"</p>



<p>Even though it was only a short trip, Miran was happy
when we returned home.</p>



<p>"Thanks... Shuuji was always nice, right."</p>



<p>"Always?" I was curious, but Miran just went to
change her clothes, so I didn't have time to ask her.</p>



<p>Does she mean since the first year of high school? I
decided that I didn't have to bother to ask her and went to the kitchen to make
some snacks so that Miran could take her medicine.</p>



<p>That night, our parents came home from vacation, which became
the end of our short life together for me and Miran.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Miran's health seems to have recovered during the
holidays, and she spends time with her gyaru friends at school as usual.
Looking at it that way, I felt as if the event where we lived together at home
was just a dream. However, I still remember how full my heart was when I held
her hand.</p>



<p>"----"</p>



<p>Suddenly, my eyes met Miran in class. The smile she gave
me made me feel good. I saw it more often when I was at school. Although living
with her was too stimulating and difficult, the aftermath made me feel like I
was getting to know Miran better than ever.</p>
