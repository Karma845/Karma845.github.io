<h3>Chapter 5 - Introvert Guy and Barbecue </h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>1</b></p>

<p>I've had a new problem lately. Of course, it has to do
with my fiancée, Hanatsuki Miran. She is a beautiful and cheerful gyaru,
popular with both men and women, loves sweets, loves fashion, is kind and
gentle, loves cats, and turns out to be childish... Through dating and living
together as a fiancée, I got to know many sides of Hanatsuki Miran. On the
contrary, she also understood and accepted me. </p>


<p>"............"</p>



<p>Unconsciously, I became very worried about Miran. I'm
curious, is <b>that</b> the reason?</p>



<p>"Miran-chan and the others are so nice, huh~"</p>



<p>"They seem to be used to playing together."</p>



<p>"Do I have to go for Miran-chan, huh?"</p>


<p>"I heard that Shige-senpai from the basketball club
has his sights set on her."</p>



<p>"Really? Then I can't win. Damn!"</p>



<p>During the break, I could hear the trivial conversations
of those flashy and stupid guys. In the past, I didn't care.</p>



<p>"It sucks, really..."</p>



<p>&#8212;But lately I've been irritated when I hear it. </p>



<p>"You guys take Miran too lightly...", I
muttered to myself.</p>



<p>No one could hear my mumbling because I was face down on
the table, pretending to sleep as usual, but I could hear other people's
conversations. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Seriously, I've been hearing a lot of Miran-related
conversations and topics lately. Or, it's more accurate to say that I've
noticed them rather than spontaneously heard them. Because my fiancée, the
extroverted gyaru, was so beautiful and charming, she became very popular with
boys. So for a long time, I was used to hearing the words of those who wanted
to be her girlfriend or play with her. However, lately, whenever such a topic
comes up, I become overly sensitive and always feel angry. </p>



<p>"............"</p>

<p>Never mind. If it's just that, I can still control it.
But lately other emotions have come up and tormented me. For example, in the
middle of the classroom. There was a group of gyaru, led by the popular gyaru,
and a group of flashy guys, chatting happily. </p>



<p>"Interesting, isn't it? Uww." </p>



<p>"Miran-chan, look at this."</p>



<p>"Ha-ha-ha, what's so funny?" Miran
chatted happily with the flashy guys. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Every time I see this scene... Every time I heard them
chatting happily, a burning and gloomy feeling arose in me. </p>



<p>What is this feeling? I was confused at first, but I
finally found out the name of that feeling. Perhaps this feeling is called <i>'jealousy'</i>.
</p>



<p>When Miran was busy chatting with other boys, my heart
was burned by the flames of frustration, impatience, and feelings of
helplessness. </p>



<p>"What I feel is so... painful." This is what
I've been experiencing lately. </p>



<p>An emotion I hadn't felt before was now coming out strong
and powerful, making it difficult for me to deal with it. </p>



<p>"Miran, you are so popular..."</p>



<p>As I observed again while pretending to be asleep, Miran
and her group of Gyaru friends were always approached by many boys from
classmates, other classes, and even different grades every break. I can tell
how many of them like Miran by their looks and attitudes. More than half of
them. </p>



<p>"It's better...like this."</p>



<p>&#8212;Should I tell everyone that she is my fiancée? </p>



<p>I thought so, but when I thought about what happened
afterwards, a part of me was too worried to go that far. </p>



<p>"Haaah..."</p>



<p>If only I were a cool and good guy, I wouldn't have to
worry about such things, right? The reason I can't tell people around me that
she's my fiancée is because I'm a boring introvert that everyone looks down on.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I've been thinking about it lately. </p>



<p>That&#8212;is there no one more suitable for Hanatsuki Miran
than an introverted person like me? That's what I thought. </p>



<p>Miran was willing to go out with me because she was my
fiancée, and she tried to understand me, but&#8212;after all, the engagement was
first decided by our parents. If it is Miran, who is a beautiful gyaru and has
a good personality, she should be able to choose a better man than me. I felt
guilty that I had ruined her chances by making her my <i>&#8216;fiancée&#8217;</i>. </p>



<p>"Huh... I'm really annoying."</p>



<p>However, lately I've been suffering from nagging jealousy
and inferiority complex. I really don't know how to deal with it.</p>



<p>***</span></b></p>



<p>"Hey, hey! What's about the holiday this
time?!"</p>



<p>As my jealousy and inferiority complex grew, I overheard
a flashy boy enthusiastically calling Miran and her friends during a break in
class. </p>



<p>"Shall we go to the barbecue together? Shige-senpai
invited us."</p>



<p>While I pretended to be asleep and listened to him, I
giggled slightly. Here it is, the BBQ. An event synonymous with extroverted
personalities. By the way, I don't have the slightest clue as to what the
benefits are here. The place is already unhealthy, there are ashes and insects
flying around, why would anyone want to eat like that? </p>



<p>"Great, there's a barbecue!" </p>



<p>"Who else is coming?"</p>



<p>Said Hanako-san, a gyaru friend who is always with Miran,
and Adzuki-san, who is enthusiastic. Then Miran was asked very specifically. </p>



<p>"What about you, Miran-chan?"</p>



<p>"Barbecue, huh? I want to go anyway, but..."
Miran seemed to be worried about something. </p>



<p>Before the fire of jealousy flared up again, I quickly
put it out. No, no, Miran is free to associate with whomever she wants! Even
though she went to the barbecue, I won't get angry or think she's cheating on
me. I'm not jealous. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>By closing my eyes, I proposed to myself. While I
pretended to be asleep and continued to listen, Miran replied,
"Then...".</p>



<p>"Can I take Shuuji with me?" she continued.</p>



<p>Really? I slammed my foot against the table with a thud.
An unexpected deadly pass was aimed at me and I couldn't help but react.</p>



<p>"Shuuji? Are you serious?" The
noise attracted the attention of the extroverts even more, so much so that I
could hear their confusion. I felt that it would stand out even more if I was
left alone, so I slowly raised my face and asked.</p>



<p>"Um, someone called me?"</p>



<p>"Yes..." replied the flashy guy who had made a
look of disbelief before. I could feel the shock.</p>



<p>"Alright, if Miran-chan says so, then..."</p>



<p>Nodding like he couldn't help it, the flashy guy asked me
again to confirm it. </p>



<p>"So, what about you? Do you want to come?"</p>



<p>Uwaaa, I don't really want to go! But Miran seemed to
want me to come... What should I do? The barbecue was too hard for me. </p>



<p>"No, I..." I almost opened my mouth to say
no&#8212;but I thought about it again. Immediately, something stuck in my mind. </p>



<p>"I heard that Shige-senpai from the basketball club
has his eye on her." If I remember correctly, it was one of
the boys who said something like that. Then again, that boy who invited Miran
and his friends was also invited by Shige-senpai.</p>



<p>"Um, I'll join."</p>



<p>I, who was worried about Miran, announced my
participation. I was surprised to realize that I had made such a decision,
since I had always flatly refused barbecue events before.</p>



<p>"Then it's decided, right>&#9834;!"
Miran replied in a cheerful tone.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Hanako-san and Adzuki-san looked at me as if
they suspected something, so I tried to keep my expression flat, though I
didn't know if it was effective. </p>



<p>"I'm going to invite you all to the REIN
group." The flashy guy told everyone. </p>



<p>"Group?"</p>



<p>I pulled out my smartphone and rushed to find out what he
meant. Apparently, REIN has a feature that allows multiple people to
communicate at the same time&#8212;but the only one who knows my REIN contacts is
Miran. </p>



<p>"I'll invite Shuuji to the group."</p>



<p>I was invited into the group through Miran as an
intermediary, but this made the looks of her two gyaru friends even sharper.
They had suspected me from the beginning, and maybe I would be in trouble soon.
</p>



<p>"Ugh...." looked at the group screen and
couldn't help but complain a little. From what I've seen, there are quite a few
barbecue members, and the number of messages and stickers is no joke. Seeing
the messages and stickers flowing so quickly, I decided to learn about barbecue
so as not to hinder them. </p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 107%;">***</p>



<p>Lunch time came. I sat in my usual place at the back of
the school building and watched the REIN group with deep emotion as their
messages and stickers made a fuss.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>I never imagined that there would come a time when I
would mingle with such extroverts. </p>



<p>"Thanks for waiting, Shuuji." I heard a
soothing voice that was familiar and turned my head to see my fiancée running
towards me. </p>



<p>"Miran..."</p>



<p>We plan to have lunch together today. As soon as I stood
up, Miran smiled and took my lunch box out of the paper bag she was carrying. </p>



<p>"Here, go ahead</span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 107%;">&#9834;</span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: inherit; line-height: 107%;">."</p>



<p>"Thank you so much ...."</p>



<p>My gloomy feelings disappeared immediately after I
received the lunch box from Miran. We sat down together and now I could sit
closer to her than ever before. </p>



<p>"Today's bento looks delicious too, right?"</p>



<p>I opened my lunch box and immediately saw a variety of
colorful dishes. What's more, a beautiful gyaru is sitting next to me. It's
good to have Miran to myself at school. </p>



<p>"----?"</p>



<p>Suddenly, I felt a glance and turned my head to see
Miran's worried look. </p>



<p>"W-What's wrong?"</p>



<p>"About today's barbecue. I don't think Shuuji likes
it." With a regretful look on her face, Miran apologized, </p>



<p>"I'm sorry for forcing you to come."</p>



<p>"N-no, it's okay, really! Don't worry about
it."</p>



<p>I waved my arms with all my might, remembering that I had
experienced this before. It was true that I was momentarily surprised when she
suddenly asked me to join her, but I was the one who made the final decision. </p>



<p>"In my opinion, if we are going to have a barbecue,
it would be more exciting if Shuuji is there."</p>



<p>"Miran..." Hearing her words, I suddenly felt
ashamed of myself. </p>



<p>I decided to join because I was afraid that Shige-senpai
would set his sights on Miran. Out of jealousy and inferiority, I became so
petty that my feelings of joy turned to sadness. </p>



<p>"Miran, you don't have to worry. In fact, I am very
grateful that you invited me."</p>



<p>Miran invited me because she wanted to be with me. Just
thinking about it makes me happy. When I thanked her, Miran's face brightened
and she said,</p>



<p>"No, actually I'm the one who should thank you for
wanting to come. It feels exciting to have a barbecue with you!"</p>



<p>Hearing those words and looking at her expression, my
gloomy and hesitant feeling turned into confidence. That's right, Miran had
already taken the trouble to invite me to their event. </p>



<p>"I'll do my best to be useful there."</p>



<p>I will do my best to make Miran enjoy this event. Miran
laughed when I made my decision. </p>



<p>"You don't have to think about being a useful person
or anything like that, okay?"</p>



<p>Although Miran told me that, I have to try to be a useful
person considering that there are other people in the group. I have to make
sure not to embarrass Miran's face, who has already invited me. </p>



<p>"I'm really looking forward to the barbecue!"</p>



<p>"Yes, I'm looking forward to it..." I nodded my
head and looked at Miran with a face full of excitement.</p>



<p>After lunch, Miran, who had something to do with her
friends, went back to the classroom first. I spent some time at the back of the
school building, watching the REIN group and looking for information about the
barbecue. </p>



<p>As the end of my lunch break approached, I walked down
the hall to get back to the classroom. </p>



<p>"Hey! Wait!" A loud male voice came from
somewhere. </p>



<p>That voice sounded familiar. Come to think of it, there
were more voices,</p>



<p>"Wait!"</p>



<p>As I remembered a few days ago, he was holding my
shoulders. </p>



<p>"Don't ignore me!"</p>



<p>I turned around and it was the flashy senpai who warned
me before. And it turned out that he was the one who called me again. </p>



<p>"W-What is it?"</p>



<p>I can guess what he will say, but I will ask anyway. As
for the answer, he made a face of disgust instead. </p>



<p>"I heard you were coming to the barbecue."</p>



<p>"Um, yeah..."</p>



<p>Uwaa, did this flashy senpai come to the barbecue as
well? Immediately, the atmosphere became dull. </p>



<p>"Also, it seems that Miran is the one who invited
you. What does that mean?"</p>



<p>"Well, it means she's a kind-hearted person who
cares about introverts like me, right?"</p>



<p>I answered with a joke, because it was a question that my
former introverted self couldn't handle. </p>



<p>He, who didn't like my reaction, stuck his tongue out at
me. </p>



<p>"Don't be happy yet, you introvert!"</p>



<p>He who raised his eyebrows asked me glaringly, </p>



<p>"Are you having a relationship with
Miran-chan?"</p>



<p>"Although you said so&#8212;" When I avoided him, he
mocked me. </p>



<p>"Yes, that's right haha, it's impossible for her to
have a relationship with a boring man like you."</p>



<p>This senpai is so annoying and boring! </p>



<p>On the other hand, we attracted the attention of the
students more than expected. Noticing this, he let me go, saying, "Never
mind, don't bother me that day," and then left. </p>



<p>I looked at his long back and sighed inwardly. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>It seems that I've made the right decision to leave,
because there are such people among those extroverts. </p>



<p><b>***</b></p>



<p>Despite all this, the D-day of the barbecue is
approaching. After returning home, I watched barbecue videos every day, read
articles on the Internet, and studied the outdoor books I borrowed from the
library. Finally, the night before D-day, I received a REIN message from Miran.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnzs3jA9SWHYnDno6gPDdgPit3rhOIjbk10DNnEwJVhJhcODz7yId9dliYPVpHRpG3v6eJdEkjKM0RYhQHDVPxFr2iBBNm9nmQ959W4edvN-waUVxzBZimSCqdzmUiM3w1uVN8WPJ3tn6fFkMq-U56WkCCB73BZoTVFWysVeLFOFSfHVkH4A8J69JCSw/s3264/20230204_005812.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3264" data-original-width="3141" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnzs3jA9SWHYnDno6gPDdgPit3rhOIjbk10DNnEwJVhJhcODz7yId9dliYPVpHRpG3v6eJdEkjKM0RYhQHDVPxFr2iBBNm9nmQ959W4edvN-waUVxzBZimSCqdzmUiM3w1uVN8WPJ3tn6fFkMq-U56WkCCB73BZoTVFWysVeLFOFSfHVkH4A8J69JCSw/s320/20230204_005812.jpg" width="308" /></a></span></div><span style="font-size: medium;"></span><p></p>

<p>From her REIN message it is also clear that Miran is
looking forward to it. </p>



<p>"Miran..."</p>



<p>I was worried because it was the first time in my life
that I was going to have a barbecue with so many people, but of course I was
also excited because I was going to play with this gyaru, who was my fiancée.
While I imagined Miran's smile in my mind, I answered her so that we could
enjoy tomorrow's barbecue more.</p>

<p>The message was immediately answered&#8212; </p>



<p>"How am I supposed to answer that?"</p>



<p>I looked at Miran's suggestion and thought about it. I
really wanted to go together, but Miran's gyaru friends were already suspicious
of our relationship, and it would be bad if that boring senpai saw us too.
After thinking about it, I replied&#8212;</p>

<p>Enthusiastically, I studied about the barbecue once
again.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>2</b></p>

<p>Then came the day of the barbecue.</p>



<p>"Because I am reviewing it is so serious, I have
lost sleep...!"</p>



<p>Again, I didn't get enough sleep! I tried to sleep, but
when I closed my eyes, feelings of fear and worry began to fill my mind. It
kept happening without me noticing.</p>



<p>Still, I decided to wear long sleeves and pants today to
be safe from sparks. Plus, it's not made of synthetic fibers, it's 100 percent
cotton. According to a book, cotton is less flammable than synthetic fibers.
The only problem is that the weather is a little too hot right now. It's rare
to see people wearing such thick clothes in the days when spring has ended and
early summer is beginning, so I look a bit conspicuous. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>I made my way to the location using the map that had been
sent to the REIN group. Since this event was held by the river, I had to walk
for a while, staring at the obscure map showing the destination location, and
only then found a group of people who looked like them. </p>



<p>"I know it, there are a lot of people here...."</p>



<p>I knew this group from REIN, but there's quite a few of
them. The ratio of boys to girls is about 8 to 2. There is a mix of students
who are in the same grade as me, seniors and juniors. Also, although I already
know this, they all seem to be people who are good at socializing. </p>



<p>"It seems that Miran and her friends have not yet
arrived." Miran and her two friends have not arrived yet.</p>



<p>I should have come with them. I don't have a single exact
acquaintance, so it's hard to join. It took a lot of courage for me, an
introverted loner, to meet a group of extroverts. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>However, feeling that there was no point in staying here,
I went down to the bottom of the river and decided to join the group of
extroverts. </p>



<p>"Oh, um,... Halo."</p>



<p>When I gathered my courage and said hello, none of them
responded with the words "hey," "oii," or "eiii."
Besides, they're all dressed up like they're going out of town. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>I don't know, I just feel different myself! It looks very
incompatible with the clothes I wear! I already feel like I'm not going to make
it! Miran, come here quickly! I said to myself. </p>



<p>"Shige-senpai, hei!"</p>



<p>I heard someone greeting Shige-senpai and reflexively
turned my head. Shige-senpai is a member of the basketball club who seems to be
after Miran, and is predicted to be the best player on the basketball team, has
a handsome face, is smart in class, and is popular with the girls. I've always
been curious about what he looks like, because from what I've heard, he's a
high-spec extrovert. </p>



<p>"Shige-senpai, halo!"</p>



<p>A tall, high-spec, flashy boy appears casually after
being greeted&#8212;Shige-senpai.</p>



<p>"----!?"</p>



<p>My eyes widened when I saw his face because I recognized
him so much.</p>



<p>"Impossible, is that really Shige-senpai?"</p>



<p>Shige-senpai is the boring, flashy senpai who argues with
me in the hallway. But I understand. I understand that the reason he bothered
to visit me was because he liked Miran. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>When I saw Shige-senpai again, I suddenly felt
uncomfortable. In addition to his personality, it is true that Shige-senpai has
a handsome face, a tall posture, and is fashionable. He is also good at talking
to boys and girls. </p>



<p>But what about me? I'm an introverted character who has a
hard time communicating and can't do anything but talk about otaku. Not to
mention, I was wearing long sleeves and pants that were out of season. As you
can see, there is almost no element that makes me win, right?</p>



<p>As I looked at the unbelievable reality, the look in
Shige-senpai's eyes changed. When I turned to see the direction of his gaze, I
saw that Miran and his gyaru friends had just arrived. </p>



<p>"Sorry to keep you guys waiting..."</p>



<p>I couldn't help but admire Miran's figure as he walked
down to the bottom of the river in his usual cheerful tone. She was wearing a
white shirt with short sleeves and a thin cardigan. She was also wearing denim
shorts. Miran looks so good in her clothes that she can move around easily and
look cool. Of course, Miran's two gyaru friends also look stylish and
beautiful, but in my eyes, Miran is much more beautiful. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Although there are many other gyaru here, they are
different in class. Meanwhile, the flashy guys, including Shige-senpai,
actually got more excited. </p>



<p>***</span></b></p>



<p>After a while, everyone seemed to have gathered and the
barbecue began quietly. However, since the grill was not yet ready, everyone
chatted and played by the river instead. Miran, who is also a popular figure
here, is surrounded by girls and boys. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>I, who couldn't say hello to Miran and didn't know what
to do, went to see the grill being prepared. I'm so excited to see the real
thing, because before I only learned it. </p>



<p>"Tch, how the hell to do this..."</p>



<p>I could hear the click of his tongue. The nagging Senpai
was carrying a grill and seemed to be having trouble preparing it. Seeing him
so irritated made me speak. </p>



<p>"Oh, um, do you want me to help?"</p>



<p>"Really? Then I'm counting on you!"</p>



<p>"What?"</p>



<p>Senpai, who had been nagging, handed everything over to me
and immediately went off to have fun. It happened in an instant. </p>



<p>So this is what those flashy guys are like?</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Well, since I was the one who approached him, I won't say
anything. </p>



<p>I went straight to work and set up the stove, remembering
what I had learned from the video. It seems that this is quite a complex stove
and the assembly is obviously a bit complicated. </p>



<p>When I finally managed to assemble it and prepare to
start the fire&#8212;</p>



<p>"Shuji, I'll help you too!"</p>



<p>A familiar, soothing voice touched my ears. </p>



<p>"Miran?"</p>



<p>I turned to see my fiancée approaching me. As I hurriedly
moved away, I saw Miran's whole body in thin clothes with her cardigan off,
which made my heart beat faster. The sleeveless, tank-top-like shirt and her
long, white legs stretching out of the short denim pants were fascinating.
Plus, the shirt was tight enough to show off her curves. Most importantly, I
could see her underwear through the translucent shirt!</p>



<p>"----!?"</p>



<p>I quickly turned my face, which was greeted with a
feeling of confusion by Miran. </p>



<p>"What's going on?"</p>



<p>"N-No, it's just ...." When I was at a loss to
say it, Miran came closer to me. Her transparent underwear and skin are close
to me, making my face get hot like being roasted by a charcoal fire. </p>



<p>"It's very transparent...maybe you should cover it
up." </p>



<p>When I said it, instead of being embarrassed, Miran
actually laughed out loud. </p>



<p>"Oh, it's a swimsuit, you know! Because I thought it
would get wet in the river."</p>



<p>"Swimsuit?!"</p>



<p>For a moment I wondered if it was really a swimsuit, but
looking at it from under the translucent shirt, it was sensational and I didn't
think it was any different from underwear. </p>



<p>"I wear underwear too, though."</p>



<p>Then she suddenly tried to undo her denim shorts right in
front of me, so I quickly stopped her. </p>



<p>"A-All right! You don't have to take them off!"</p>



<p>I lowered my face while Miran looked into my eyes and
asked, "Are you worried about my see-through clothes?"</p>



<p>"No... um, well... a little bit, anyway."</p>



<p>If it's just me, of course I want to keep seeing it.<span> </span>But there are a lot of other boys here, so I
don't want her to show them. </p>



<p>"If Shuuji is worried, then I will wear a top. But I
only showed Shuuji this shirt."</p>



<p>My heart almost exploded when Miran told me this behind
my back. The feeling of being so happy mixed with embarrassment made me unable
to look directly at my fiancée for a while. Then Miran put on her cardian
again, looked at the grill and said, </p>



<p>"Can I help you prepare it?"</p>



<p>"Oh, thank you... But don't worry. I'm almost done
with the preparations."</p>

<p>I calmed myself by taking a moment to focus on the
preparation. </p>



<p>"It's really great that you are willing to prepare
it while everyone is playing around."</p>



<p>"Not that great anyway. I just like this kind of
simple work, it feels so good, really."</p>



<p>I'm not being modest, but this is the reality. Besides,
this is the only way I can benefit everyone. Later, while I was working with
Miran watching me, Hanako and Adzuki-san came over smiling. </p>



<p>"This is the Shuuji-kun that Miran likes,
right!"</p>



<p>"You're so good at preparing everything, huh!"</p>



<p>Miran's face lit up as she said this to her two gyaru
friends who were talking to her. </p>



<p>"True! Preparing everything is great, isn't
it!"</p>



<p>The two best friends looked at each other and said with a
smile at Miran's attitude. </p>



<p>"Why is Miran so proud?"</p>



<p>"Um..."</p>



<p>Miran, tightly shut <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">her mouth<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">, looked at me as if she was
having a hard time. She had just said a lot... hmmm, I understand, Miran isn't
good at hiding things. When Miran couldn't answer, I clapped my hands and
forcibly changed the subject. </p>



<p>"Oh yes! I have a beach ball, why don't you play
with it?"</p>



<p>I don't know who brought it, there is a beach ball that
hasn't been blown up yet, so I hurriedly blew it up and gave it to the gyaru. </p>



<p>"Shuuji-kun, why don't you play with us?"
"Let's play, the four of us." Hanako-san and Adzuki-san, who didn't
seem to be following up on the previous matter, smiled and invited me to join
them. </p>



<p>"I still have to finish this..."</p>



<p>"That's right. In that case, let's go Miran!"</p>



<p>I was embarrassed while her two gyaru friends took a
beach ball and went to the riverbank. Miran looked worried about me setting up
the stove alone, to which I replied with a smile. </p>



<p>"Don't worry about me, have fun," I said.</p>



<p>"But..."</p>



<p>I heard her friends calling Miran, so I urged her, </p>



<p>"Look, they're calling you, you know."</p>



<p>"Uh-huum."</p>



<p>Miran, who was still worried about me, continued to walk
in the direction of her friends. For now&#8212;I ignored Shige-senpai who was
watching Miran and concentrated on making sure Miran and her friends enjoyed
the barbecue. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>After my mind calmed down again, I finished preparing the
stove. It seems that no one else is willing to do it, so I started preparing
the food this time.</p>



<p>"Today, I am going to express my feelings for
Miran-chan."</p>



<p>"Seriously?"</p>



<p>Hearing such a conversation, I turned around and saw
Shige-senpai talking confidently to the junior.</p>



<p>"Well, I think I can do it."</p>



<p>"In that case, please introduce me to Miran-chan's
friend!"</p>



<p>All in all, this is a very lowly conversation. </p>



<p>"----!"</p>



<p>The feeling of anger that I had forgotten came back to
me. Of course, I don't want Miran to be taken away by that kind of person,
but...</p>



<p>"............!"</p>



<p>Since I concealed the fact that she was my fiancée, I
have no right to comment on the confession itself. After all, I am a loner otaku
with no qualities. Whereas he is the ace of the basketball team. A man with
high standards, good grades, and a handsome face. I'm sure people will think
that Shige-senpai is more suitable for Miran than I am. </p>



<p>What if Miran feels that Shige-senpai is good for her?
What if she falls in love with him? What would I do? </p>



<p>After all, this engagement was decided by our parents,
and it seems that I don't have the right to bind Miran to me either. </p>



<p>"----"</p>



<p>Thoughts like these kept swirling around in my head like
a violent, muddy current. While I was dissolving in restlessness, the barbecue
was fully prepared. </p>





<p>"Awesome! It's ready!"</p>



<p>As one of the flashy guys eagerly began to cook the meat,
the aroma and voice drew the attention of the other members who had previously
scattered to gather. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>I am doing my duty. No, it is more convenient for me to
do housework now, such as grilling meat, frying vegetables, serving them on a
plate with a perfect degree of doneness, cleaning up the garbage, etc. If I had
done normal things, I would have thought of a lot of negative things. That's
why I concentrate on the behind-the-scenes tasks. </p>



<p>"Shuji-kun is a hardworking person, huh?"</p>



<p>"But don't you feel sorry for him?" </p>



<p>I heard the voices of Hanako-san and Adzuki-san. When I
turned around, I also saw Miran looking at me with great concern. To calm her
down, I replied in a cheerful tone, </p>



<p>"No, it's so much fun, you know."</p>



<p>"Shuuji, I will help you too!" At that moment,
Miran ran towards me. </p>



<p>"Miran-chan, can you come here for a while?"</p>



<p>Shige-senpai's voice called out to her. </p>



<p>"----!" My consciousness reacted faster than
Miran himself. </p>



<p>Miran, who was about to walk up to me, hesitated and
asked Shige-senpai. </p>



<p>"What is it?"</p>



<p>"I want to talk to you about something. Let's talk
there."</p>



<p>"Can't we talk here?"</p>



<p>"Well..." </p>



<p>Hearing him sigh, Miran also moved to change places with
Shige-senpai. </p>



<p>Seeing that, my heart was scratched as if it was being
sanded. What kind of face would Miran show if Shige-senpai confessed his
feelings? What kind of answer would she give? I'm very curious, but I can't
interfere right now. Besides, I'm afraid to know the truth. In the end, it was
Miran's right to make her choice, and I could only resign myself to accepting
it. </p>



<p>"----"</p>



<p>Although the time we spent together may have been short,
the relationship that has been built between me and Miran is very solid. I had
no choice but to believe that and wait anyway. </p>



<p>I swallowed as if holding my breath as I watched them
leave.</p>



<p><b>***</b></p>



<p>"So, what do you want to talk about?"</p>



<p>Miran and Shige-senpai face each other under a bridge far
away from the barbecue area. As for me, I secretly watched them from behind the
shadows. After that, I was still just curious and followed them. I know this is
a shameful thing, but my mentality is not that strong, so please forgive me. </p>



<p>"How's the barbecue today? Are you enjoying
it?"</p>



<p>"Yes."</p>



<p>"That's good. Anyway, I was the one who made the
plan."</p>



<p>"Oh, I see. But the one who prepares everything is
another person, so I forgot." </p>



<p>Hearing Miran's words, Shige-senpai looked a little
annoyed. </p>



<p>"Miran-chan invited that gloomy boy, right? It's
very useful that you bring a good helper, but you also have to think about who
you invite to the gathering."</p>



<p>Before I could think of anything else, I felt Miran's
expression turn colder than I had ever seen it before. </p>



<p>"He's not a helper, you know!?"</p>



<p>"Really? Then why do you care so much about that
guy, lol?" Shige-senpai smiled bitterly. </p>



<p>Miran's attitude turned cold. </p>



<p>"What is it anyway? If there is nothing important, I
will go back."</p>



<p>"No, wait..." Shige, who had hurriedly called
her, cleared his throat as if to change the subject. </p>



<p>"Listen, I think we will be a good match."</p>



<p>"Really? I doubt it."</p>



<p>"No, I'm sure we'll hit it off! I'm free now, so
let's go out." [TN: Lol, such a way to confess. Nice try, NPC]</p>



<p>Shige-senpai's confession.</p>



<p>"I'm sorry. I can't." </p>



<p>But Miran answered immediately, without even thinking
about it. </p>



<p>"What?"</p>



<p>He probably hadn't expected to be rejected outright.
Shige-senpai raised his voice madly. </p>



<p>"W-Why!?</p>



<p>"Because I already have someone in my heart."</p>



<p>Someone who fills your heart&#8212;Miran has someone like that?
I was surprised, but a few moments later, I wondered if what she was talking
about was about me? I wanted to know. </p>



<p>"No, no. It can't be! What kind of person has
already filled your heart?" Shige-senpai couldn't hide his surprise and
ruffled his hair. </p>



<p>Miran smiled coldly at Shige-senpai and said. </p>



<p>"He's a much better person than you, you know!"</p>



<p>"What?"</p>



<p>"He doesn't seem to remember, but he was a person
who was always kind, innocent and hadn't changed at all since we first met as
children."</p>



<p>Miran, whose expression reminded me of the past, said
with a slight smile and shyness. </p>



<p>"I love this person so much," she continued.</p>



<p>"----!?" Looking at Miran's face and hearing
her words, I felt a strong sense of déjà vu. </p>



<p>This familiar feeling made me remember the past. She was
the girl I used to see a lot when I was a kid, when I used to travel with my
parents. I don't remember how we first met. I forgot, but every time I went on
a trip, we would see each other somehow, and without me knowing, we were
already good friends. The thing I remember most was when I was told that I
wouldn't be able to see her for a while because of my parents' job. Then,
things that the girl said to me at that time&#8212; </p>



<p><i><span> </span>"Shuuji-kun, I love you so much! Let's get married in the
future!"</i></p>



<p>I forgot about the current situation and drifted in a
nostalgic atmosphere for a while, but then it dawned on me. The girl who was,
don't tell me she was... Miran? No, but the girl who was then had a calm
appearance and a more relaxed atmosphere, right? However, if it is true that
<i>'someone who fills the hearth'</i> of Miran is me, then it makes sense, and it also
explains the familiar feelings I often experience. </p>



<p>"What? What the hell was that?" Shige-senpai,
who couldn't accept the fact, felt very upset.</p>



<p>Shige-senpai's attitude got worse as he looked at her and
asked Miran as if he was making fun of her. </p>



<p>"Don't tell me&#8212;that person was the gloomy guy or
something, haha?"</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>"Are you serious?"</p>



<p>Seeing that Miran didn't refute anything, Shige-senpai
rolled his eyes. </p>



<p>"No, of course, I am better than that gloomy guy! Do
you know what people think of me? I'm cool and kind! And I know how to have
fun. I'm definitely better than him!"</p>



<p>"I'm not interested at all. Narcissistic,
disgusting!"</p>



<p>Miran interrupted him sharply, making Shige-senpai angry
with her. </p>



<p>"What? What the hell!"</p>



<p>Looking at Shige who was trying to grab Miran, </p>



<p>"...!" I realized that I had jumped out.
Shige-senpai was surprised when I pulled back his hand that was about to catch
Miran. </p>



<p>"What are you doing?"</p>



<p>"Don't put your hand&#8212;" </p>



<p>"Huh!?" He said.</p>



<p>I glared at that trash guy and said, </p>



<p>"Don't put your hand on someone so precious to
me!"</p>



<p>I wonder if I've ever shouted so loudly in my life.
Shige-senpai was startled for a moment, but he quickly let go of my hand. </p>



<p>"Don't get carried away, you gloomy boy!" He
swung his fist at me. </p>



<p>I do not boast and I am weak in fights. I'll be beaten to
the ground. However, I will not let him touch Miran, even if I have to take a
lot of blows. When I was ready to take his blow with this determination. </p>



<p>"Uwaa, he's a cheap loser who directly uses violence
just because he's rejected, eww."</p>



<p>"He's so disgusting, scary~!"</p>



<p>The voices sounded very loud and echoed under this
bridge. When I saw it, there were two of Miran's gyaru friends, Hanako-san and
Adzuki-san, holding their smartphones and laughing coldly. </p>



<p>"What the hell is this?!"</p>



<p>Shige-senpai glared at them, raising his fist, and they
responded with a mocking laugh. </p>



<p>"We're recording it now, what do you want to
do?"</p>



<p>"To be more precise, I posted the video in the REIN
group, lol."</p>



<p>Adzuki-san showed me the screen of her smartphone after
the message was sended. Not long after that, my smartphone started to flood
with messages along with notification sounds.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 4.75pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 107%;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGkgs5iwz3AQT45PLVVwyDAooVFCdtQ3QtaM9ugNq6m41SZwgrLWBP1Tm5USfSGTnU2IapZDVHi2FFCojPsPrWzVYeDSpExDSSVuxvI8WrGgxBc-Cq6qT5_cDm9CjI1zQXa8X-Udk1H3E-sBsWGvo66QMIKkeCY1JQY_uMOoREo08TbCMhzA-uDCqjnA/s3264/20230204_004828.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3264" data-original-width="3082" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgGkgs5iwz3AQT45PLVVwyDAooVFCdtQ3QtaM9ugNq6m41SZwgrLWBP1Tm5USfSGTnU2IapZDVHi2FFCojPsPrWzVYeDSpExDSSVuxvI8WrGgxBc-Cq6qT5_cDm9CjI1zQXa8X-Udk1H3E-sBsWGvo66QMIKkeCY1JQY_uMOoREo08TbCMhzA-uDCqjnA/s320/20230204_004828.jpg" width="302" /></a></span></div><p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; margin-right: 4.75pt; margin-top: 0cm; margin: 0cm 4.75pt 0cm 0cm;"></p>

<p>Almost all of the incoming messages are criticisms of
Shige-senpai. Then, when he opened his own smartphone, he clicked his tongue as
he said, "Just remember!" Shige-senpai flees, leaving behind words
like the loser villain in the manga.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>3</b></p>

<p>After Shige-senpai left, I felt like I was going to
faint. Meanwhile, Miran hugged my back and said, </p>



<p>"Shuuji, thank you&#8212;"</p>



<p>"Uh, um?" The soft touch on my back made me
nervous. I, who felt the warmth, the scent and the slight trembling, spoke to
Miran who was behind me. </p>



<p>"I came because I was worried. I'm glad you're
okay."</p>



<p>Then Hanako-san and Adzuki-san came over to me and Miran.
</p>



<p>"Miran's boyfriend who came to the rescue is so
cool, right?"</p>



<p>"I've been wondering about him for a long time, is
he really your boyfriend?"</p>



<p>My shout that saying not to touch someone who was
precious to me before, made me unable to dodge it anymore. In fact, the video
along with Shige-senpai's words and actions has also been uploaded in the REIN
group. </p>



<p>"Miran, you have a good guy, you know!"</p>



<p>"Hey, if you look at him again, isn't he a handsome guy,
huh?" The two of them spoke to Miran with a seductive phrase. </p>



<p>Miran, who had moved away from my back, said to them with
a look of embarrassment mixed with pride on her face. </p>



<p>"It's true, isn't it? He is a husband I am very
proud of!"</p>



<p>""Husband?""</p>



<p>It was obviously an unexpected response. Her two friends
tilted their heads and looked at each other. Unexpectedly, I also realized it
too late. I mean, we can be called lovers, but we haven't entered the realm of
husband and wife yet. </p>



<p>Miran seemed to realize this as well and looked at me. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>To be honest, I have my doubts. I might cause trouble for
Miran in the future by being his fiancée. But... after going through these
events, I nodded my head with determination, understanding how much I loved and
cherished Hanatsuki Miran all along. </p>



<p>"You don't have to hide it anymore. I'm sorry that I
forced you to keep it a secret," I said. </p>



<p>Hearing my words, Miran smiled from ear to ear, "I'm
so happy! I have long wanted to say it to you guys."</p>



<p>Miran's eyes lit up and she wrapped her hands around my
arms. </p>

<p>She pulled her body close to mine as I began to doubt
again and proudly told her two friends, "Actually&#8212;". </p>



<p>"&#8212;We're already engaged, you know!"</p>



<p>"Engaged!" </p>



<p>I don't think they really expected that. Hanako-san and
Adzuki-san were so shocked that they were speechless for a while. </p>



<p>"Um, wait a minute, does being engaged mean that you
will get married in the future?"</p>



<p>Hanako-san asked as she began to regain consciousness.
When she said it again, I felt the weight of her words. It's true that as a
high school student, I can't imagine marriage or anything like that yet, but
even so, I think it would be better if Miran became my partner. </p>



<p>Miran, who was also smiling, replied, "Yes, that's
how it is.".</p>

</p>

<p>"That's why I'm curious why Miran never dated a man
even though she was popular, so that's the reason."</p>



<p>Adzuki-san murmured as if she understood. Miran nodded
her head and said, </p>



<p>"Yup, that's it." </p>



<p>"Just do it!", "You two look good
together." Hanako-san and Adzuki-san, looking at me and Miran in shock,
finally laughed and poked at us. </p>



<p>After that incident, Miran and I became widely known as
an engaged couple. </p>



<p>Coincidentally, there is an after story. Shige-senpai's
bad reputation soon spread throughout the school, so his popularity dropped,
and the coach of the basketball club punished him for skipping practice to go
to a barbecue event. </p>



<p>The barbecue was quite noisy at first. Then there was
Shige-senpai's commotion. There is also the story of my engagement to Miran.
There are a lot of pressing issues, but things are calming down as time goes
on. Or rather, the focus of the debate is on Miran and not on me, the
introvert, who always gives unclear answers. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>It was getting dark, I sat quietly in the corner of the
riverbank, staring at the happy people around Miran and the sparks that
glittered around them. It's too early, but we're going to set off the fireworks
that we've prepared as the last entertainment for the barbecue. </p>



<p>The extroverts have already taken all the luxurious
fireworks, so I only have the ordinary ones. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Although it looks simple, the little sparks that keep
going off are surprisingly interesting. When I was alone, trying to figure out
how long I could keep the fireworks alive, a voice suddenly called out to me. </p>



<p>"Shuuji..."</p>



<p>"M-Miran!"</p>



<p>The gyaru, my fiancée, walked over and sat down next to
me. We were so close that our shoulders touched, making me nervous and dropping
the fireworks I was holding. I rushed to prepare the next fireworks so that she
wouldn't notice my nervousness. </p>



<p>"Can I join you?"</p>



<p>"Y-Yes, of course."</p>



<p>Together we set off the fireworks. The ordinary
shimmering fireworks made Miran smile like a child. </p>



<p>"It's so beautiful!"</p>



<p>"Yes, it is."</p>



<p>I nodded, but I was more fascinated by Miran's face than
the fireworks. When Miran turned her head, I reflexively turned my face so that
the fireworks I was holding fell. A little embarrassed, I turned my eyes to see
the fireworks shining brightly in the distance with the happy looking flashy
guys. Then I cleared my throat and spoke to my fiancée. </p>



<p>"That series of questions, it must be bothering you,
right?"</p>



<p>Hearing my words, Miran looked at me with a puzzled
expression. </p>



<p>"Is that so? I'm actually happy that I can talk a
lot about Shuuji, you know?"</p>



<p>"W-Why do you want to talk about me?"</p>



<p>I feel like I haven't done much so far, so I'm a little
curious about what she said to everyone. When Miran's fireworks went out, I
tried to put out new fireworks, but Miran said to me gently. </p>



<p>"Thank you so much for saving me."</p>



<p>"Uh, no, it's not like that. I haven't done anything
that deserves your gratitude." I said hastily. </p>



<p>I'm just doing the obvious. Instead, I was the one who
was worried and looked at her. Then I remembered the conversation between Miran
and Shige-senpai and said again, </p>



<p>"Actually... I should be the one to thank you."</p>



<p>Grateful for Miran's attitude towards Shige-senpai, who
slandered me. Has anyone ever been so angry for my sake? In fact, when I
remembered it just now, my heart felt a kind of happiness, overflowing with
joy. </p>



<p>"Thank you for being angry for my sake..."</p>



<p>I turned to Miran and lowered my head. The gyaru, who was
my fiancée, smiled amusedly and muttered to me as she thought about what had
just happened. </p>



<p>"I'm so happy when you say that."</p>



<p>"That time?" I knew immediately what she was
talking about. </p>



<p><i><span> </span>"Don't put your hand on someone who is so precious to
me!"</i></p>



<p>I shouted out loud. I don't usually yell at anyone, so
it's a somewhat embarrassing memory in my mind. </p>



<p>"At that time, I spontaneously..."</p>



<p>As my face heated up, Miran laughed happily for a moment.
Then, looking into the distance as if thinking of something, she asked me in a
whisper, </p>



<p>"By the way&#8212;" </p>



<p>"&#8212;We already met a long time ago, remember?"</p>



<p>Hearing the words, I told her about childhood memories I
had experienced before. </p>



<p>"When I was a kid, I used to meet the same girl when
I traveled with my parents..."</p>



<p>I don't remember how we first met, but it was the same
girl I met on every trip. I remember that we became good friends and played
with her every time we met. </p>



<p>"It seems... That girl was Miran, right?"</p>



<p>"Yes!" When I confirmed it, Miran nodded
happily. </p>



<p>"Haven't you noticed?" she continued.</p>



<p>"Um... You look so different, sorry."</p>



<p>"But you remember me now, don't you?" When I
apologized, Miran laughed for a moment. </p>



<p>Then she nodded as if she had made up her mind and told
me, "Actually, it was me who asked my parents to continue the
engagement...".</p>



<p>"Eh? Miran?!" I was stunned by this unexpected
information. </p>



<p>I thought her parents had decided it themselves. Miran
nodded her head and spoke with some hesitation. </p>



<p>"I'm glad to be in the same high school as Shuji...
and I really wanted to get to know you well from the first year, but after a
year passed, I still couldn't do that..."</p>



<p>I remembered how she kept calling me when he was a
freshman. That's why I'm curious as to why she's so interested in me. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>However, when I thought that she had such feelings for
me, I immediately felt that all the things that had happened with her were
funny things. </p>



<p>Later Miran told me, </p>



<p>"Well, I feel that I can't go on like this and use
the excuse of our engagement."</p>



<p>"Oh, so that's what really happened, huh?"</p>



<p>I nodded as I remembered her behavior since the beginning
of our sophomore year. I remembered that she had inquired about my relationship
status, but then her attitude changed, and after that, our engagement came up,
right? As I dissolved into emotion, Miran apologized to me. </p>



<p>"I'm always worried that Shuuji will be upset
because he suddenly became my fiancée."</p>



<p>That feeling she always worried about&#8212;</p>



<p>"Miran...," I said.</p>



<p>I have a feeling that I'm not the only one who is worried
about the engagement. Then I shook my head and said, </p>



<p>"I'm just confused anyway, but I don't consider it a
nuisance."</p>



<p>"Really?"</p>



<p>"Yes, on the contrary, I am the one who is worried
that Miran will not like being engaged to me."</p>



<p>Miran is an extroverted gyaru who is popular with
everyone. I was always worried that she wouldn't like the idea of an
introverted loner like me as her fiancé. When I told her this, Miran shook her
head quickly. </p>



<p>"That's not true, you know! Shuuji was always very
kind!"</p>



<p>Miran's face turned red after saying that. Seeing her
like that made my face blush as well. I don't know if I've ever received such
affirmations or compliments before. There are so many things I've never
experienced before that it makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p>"Shuji, you know..."</p>



<p>After a moment of silence, Miran looked at me. Unlike her
hesitant expression just now, she actually gave me a big smile and said,
"Thank you for agreeing to be my fiancée".</p>



<p>"----" Those words are too beautiful to be
true, so I don't know what to say. </p>



<p>"Miran...."</p>



<p>I felt the same way. Miran's words made me think, I have
locked myself in the house for a long time because I am not interested in
others. But Miran pulled me out of that state. She made me try new things.
Myself in the past with myself in the present is completely different. That's
how I felt again, and I looked into Miran's eyes. </p>



<p>"Being engaged to Miran has made my world
bigger" I was fascinated by her beautiful eyes and I thanked the fiancée I
loved so much, </p>



<p>"Thank you for being my fiancée."</p>
