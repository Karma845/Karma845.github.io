<h3>Chapter 2 - I Should Think About Getting Involved in School
(Earnestly)</h3>

<p>I have a fiancée. What's more, she is a gyaru named Miran
Hanatsuki.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b></p>



<p>The next morning, after the day I was told that shocking
fact. When I woke up in bed, I couldn't help but laugh to myself.</p>



<p>"I seem to be having a strange dream, Hanatsuki-san
is my fiancée...," I muttered to myself.</p>



<p>It was so unbelievable that it occurred to me that it was
just a dream. The incident where my parents were dressed so neatly, and then I
hurriedly changed and got ready. Later, Hanatsuki, who was my fiancée,
came to say hello. Thinking that it was all a dream, I remembered the incident
in a semi-conscious state. However&#8212;</p>



<p>"No, it feels so real..."</p>



<p>Usually in a dream there are some obscure or ambiguous
passages, but I can remember the atmosphere and content of the conversation
quite clearly. I woke up in a cold sweat and looked at my clothes and was
shocked.</p>



<p>"These are yesterday's clothes!"</p>



<p>In my dream, these were the clothes I wore to greet
Hanatsuki-san and her parents. I fell asleep without having time to change, and
my memory of the dream was cut off right then and there.</p>



<p>"W-What, this isn't a dream? No, or is this a dream
now?"</p>



<p>I slapped my cheek, but the pain was real. As the pain
woke me from a half-sleep state, the realistic impression of my memory rose.</p>



<p>"What happened yesterday was... real?"</p>



<p>I was shocked to realize that the memories of yesterday
were not a dream, but reality. I've only ever seen people confirm whether
something is a dream or reality in manga and anime, but I didn't expect to
experience it. Sitting on the bed, I remembered what happened yesterday.</p>



<p>"Miran Hanatsuki... is my fiancée."</p>



<p>An extroverted gyaru who I thought lived in another
world. Popular with both boys and girls, always surrounded by many people, and
at the top of the school caste. It's people like her who get engaged to
introverted otaku like me. Even though it was not a dream, it still felt unreal
to me.</p>



<p>"See you at school tomorrow&#8212;&#8220;, Hanatsuki-san said as she went home. Suddenly I remember, I'm getting so panic right now.</p>



<p>"Before that..."</p>



<p>I forgot to confirm something important. Since I am in
the same school and class as Hanatsuki-san, we will definitely see each other.</p>



<p>"What should I do... at school?"</p>



<p>What kind of face should I show her? How should I
interact with her? What kind of action should I take? I don't know how to
behave as a fiancée. Should I talk casually or something? No, it was a big
hurdle for an introvert like me, and even harder because she was always
surrounded by extroverts.</p>



<p>In fact, just by interacting with Hanatsuki-san alone, I
attracted attention. So how will they look at me if I'm friendly with her?</p>



<p>Come to think of it&#8212;</p>



<p>"It's better to keep our relationship a secret at
school, right?"</p>



<p>We need to discuss this more seriously. Right now, I
don't even know what Hanatsuki-san thinks of me, and as her fiancé, I don't
know how to treat her. As a result, </p>



<p>"For now, I think it's safe to act as usual."</p>



<p>By the time the content of the strategy meeting was
completed in my mind, it was almost time to go to school, and I had also heard
my mother's voice waking me up.</p>



<p>"Anyway, let's get ready first..."</p>



<p>I got out of bed again and finally opened the curtains of
my room. The sunlight was so bright and I started to get ready for school while
thinking about my engagement with the gyaru.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b><b></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b></b></p>

<p>Then I walked to the school, through the gates, into the building,
and down the hallways like the students used to do. I am a sophomore now and
have grown accustomed to this scene. It should have been a sight I'd grown
tired of passing by, but today it inexplicably felt like something new. It was
as if I were a freshman and all sorts of things caught my eye.</p>



<p>Arriving in front of the classroom, I took a look inside.
</p>



<p>"It seems... she hasn't come yet...," I
muttered.</p>



<p>After making sure that the dazzling sun was not there, I
behaved as usual, immediately walking in without attracting attention and
taking a seat. I had mastered introverted skills when I came to school, so no
one noticed that I had arrived there. Perfect. In front of me, I could see the
same scene of the classroom as usual, with the extroverted students joking
around and some rushing to copy their homework.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>The same school as usual, as well as the classrooms.
However, even though I can camouflage myself as usual without attracting
attention, there is still a feeling of restlessness, as if I am traveling to
another world. Of course, I know why.</p>



<p>"Good morning", someone suddenly greeted me.</p>



<p>The loud and cheerful voice echoed throughout the
classroom, making my heart beat faster. The owner of the voice is an
extroverted gyaru who is my classmate&#8212;Miran Hanatsuki. She is the girl who came
to say hello yesterday as my fiancée. When she came to school so cheerfully,
her girl friends and the boys greeted her, and it didn't take long for a circle
of people to form. A familiar sight in this classroom. A scene I had never paid
much attention to before, but somehow, I paid so much attention to it today.
Not to mention that I was accidentally watching Hanatsuki-san's every move.</p>



<p>"............"</p>
  
  <p>I feel
like Hanatsuki-san, who is surrounded by a lot of people, really feels like a
popular person, and the really amazing thing is that she responds to
everything. Later, I also felt that she looked a little different wearing her
school uniform compared to her usual clothes when she visited my house yesterday.</p>

<p>"....!"</p>
  
  <p>Suddenly,
my eyes met Hanatsuki-san's, and I hastily turned my face away. Nothing bad,
just spontaneous. Did I make a bad impression? I'm sorry... but I turned my
face away from her because I didn't know what kind of expression to make. Although
I was fine last weekend, I felt strange at school and could not stop my heart
from beating. I'm curious, has Hanatsuki-san felt this kind of feeling before?</p>


<p>"How
to say it... Um... I was embarrassed... when I realized that I was your
fiancee, you know?" Hanatsuki-san said yesterday.</p>

<p>I guess
I understood that. However, I do not know if I can go on like this.</p>



<p>Confused
by this change in my mind, I lay down on the table with troubled feelings&#8212;and
could only hear Hanatsuki-san's voice.</p><p><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b></p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;"> </div><p>The lesson went on as usual and the break ended without
any problems. I was confused as to how to react when Hanatsuki-san spoke to me
even though she hadn't approached me yet. Because of her, I feel relieved and
can act casual. But instead&#8212;</p>



<p>"Hey, Miran, are you listening to me?"</p>



<p>"Huh? Yes, I hear you."</p>



<p>I often made eye contact with Hanatsuki-san who was
chatting with her gyaru friends.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>No, that's wrong. I was the only one staring at her.During break, I usually spend my time leaning
over the table and pretending to be asleep, or opening a book without reading
it, or just staring blankly at the scenery outside. But today I found myself paying
attention to the most popular gyaru in the class. The same was true during
class, I felt like I was looking at her. Since I always looked in that
direction, it was obvious that my eyes were about to cross with hers.</p>



<p>"----!"</p>



<p>I kept repeating stupid mistakes by hastily looking away.
It was a disrespectful act that I did not want to do. However, when our eyes
met, a nervous feeling took over and made me look away. Every time I in class
or a break, the frequency of eye contact with Hanatsuki-san increased. On one
occasion, she began to show a mischievous expression, as if she was amused by
my reaction and deliberately targeted me.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>Look, when I think about it calmly, I feel very bad now.
From the outside, this introverted me is like a playboy who deliberately looks
at gyaru and then looks away. Even though I felt like that, I still looked at
Hanatsuki-san strangely, and when our eyes met, I looked away with a feeling of
resentment towards myself.</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>On the other hand, Hanatsuki-san just looks normal,
except when she deliberately looks at me to amuse herself. She also went to
class normally, talked happily with her friends, and didn't act weird at all. I
began to feel ashamed of myself for being so sensitive to my fiancée.</p>



<p>"Haaa...."</p>



<p>All in all, from the point of view of a gyaru who is at
the top of the school caste&#8212;I don't think she wants people to know that she has
a fiancé who is a loner and an introvert like me.</p>



<p>"Calm down, myself...."</p>



<p>What am I so upset about? Calm down. Even though
Hanatsuki-san is my fiancée, nothing will change at school, and there really
shouldn't be any need to change. I just have to go about my days with
introverted steps as usual.</p>



<p>Calm your mind, myself!</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b></p>



<p>During the lunch break, I finally began to sort out my
thoughts and attitudes about the current situation. Then something happened
that destroyed everything at once.</p>



<p>Lunchtime is the most difficult time for a lonely
introvert. Why is that? Because I have to go to my lunch spot without anyone
noticing.</p>



<p>As soon as the lunch break began, the students in the
class formed groups of various sizes, a kind of lunch community. In such a
situation, eating lunch alone is an act that shows "I have no
friends!", like showing the misery of being a loner. In other words, it is
very conspicuous in a strange way. So when the lunch break started, I always
left the classroom without anyone noticing.</p>



<p>"Shuuji, wait!!", there was a voice from the
classroom. It was a cheerful, cool, and familiar voice. I turned around to see
a smiling Hanatsuki-san approaching me.</p>



<p>"Eh... me?!"</p>



<p>It's been a long time since I've been called by my first
name at school, so there was a long pause before I answered. I also didn't
expect to be addressed by Hanatsuki-san, so I fell silent in surprise.</p>



<p>"Let's have lunch together!" Hanatsuki-san took
me for granted with her innocent smile.</p>



<p>I was invited to lunch by the most popular gyaru in the
school. Normally, it would be a happy and fun thing that would make you feel
superior. However, looking at the atmosphere in the classroom, I can't honestly
feel happy.</p>



<p>"Eh, Miran, are you serious?"</p>



<p>The female friends who always had lunch with
Hanatsuki-san were very surprised. The flashy guys who always hung around
nearby also looked at each other. It was as if time had stood still in the
classroom. Of course, it would be like that if someone from the upper caste of
the school suddenly invited the introvert from the lower caste to lunch.</p>



<p>Their gaze was painful!</p>



<p>"Miran-chan, are you serious?", after a moment
of silence, one of the flashy guys spoke up with a wry smile.</p>



<p>"Huh? Yes, is there a problem?"</p>



<p>Hanatsuki-san smiled when she was asked back, but I felt
a slight aura of tension. The boy felt it too and said, "Nah, it's
okay."</p>



<p>"............" For some reason, the classroom
was filled with a tense atmosphere.</p>



<p>This is bad! I turned my head when I felt this.
Introverts are sensitive to this kind of atmosphere. I don't care what they
think of me. But it's not good for Hanatsuki-san to be the subject of other
people's attention because of me! Definitely not good!</p>



<p>"Huuuuf&#8212;"" I took a deep breath and
supported myself as I scratched my head and said, </p>



<p>"Ha, Hana-tsuki-san is kind, huh! You always worry
about me when I am alone, and greet me too! Thank you!"</p>



<p>"Shuuji?"</p>



<p>A sad and worried expression appeared on her face. My
speech sounded stiff, and I had doubts whether this voice sounded clear because
I wasn't used to speaking in a loud voice. However, I was relieved to find that
my words could be understood.</p>



<p>"I... will go to the store, so don't worry!" I
said, as if to explain to the people around me, and walked slowly out of the
classroom to make it look like "There is nothing to worry about".</p>



<p>"I'm so nervous!" I muttered.</p>



<p>Once I was out in the hallway and out of sight, I moved
as fast as I could.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b><b></b></p>



<p>My lunch spot is in the back corner of the school
building. I always eat my lunch by the fire exit, facing the bike parking lot.
If you ignore the dreary sight of only bikes, I can say that I like it because
basically no one comes except students who are late or go home early. By the
way, I recommend the bike owner personality guessing game here.</p>



<p>"I've used up all my speaking skills for a
year...," I muttered.</p>



<p>I had just left the classroom and was sitting in my lunch
spot, still feeling my heart pounding. Normally I'd eat lunch here, but...</p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>I didn't bring anything. At my school, some students
bring their own lunches and some buy food at the cafeteria. In my freshman
year, I asked for lunch to be made, but from my sophomore year, I started
buying lunch from the store after considering the ease and difficulty of making
lunch. However, I didn't buy anything for today because...</p>



<p>"My wallet, I left it in the classroom&#8212;"</p>



<p>Normally this would never happen! Maybe it's because I
was too uncomfortable thinking about my fiancée just now.</p>



<p>"I can't go back now&#8212;"</p>



<p>After that incident, I didn't have the courage to go back
to the classroom and get my wallet. In fact, sometimes things like this happen
and I can't do anything about it. Having given up, I could only stare blankly
at the sky and think about what Hanatsuki-san had just said and done.</p>



<p>"I never expected you to invite me..."</p>



<p>I have mixed feelings, feeling happy but also confused.
But for me, it's the feeling of happiness that dominates. It's been a long time
since someone invited me to have lunch at school. I also feel sorry when I
refuse the invitation, for whatever reason.</p>



<p>"Can I afford to be a good fiancée for her?" I
asked myself.</p>



<p>My mind kept spinning, thinking about the huge gap
between the extroverted gyaru and the introverted otaku, while I looked back at
the boring bicycle parking lot.</p>



<p>While I was hungry and brooding like that, a voice
reached my ears, "I knew you were here!" and when I turned around, </p>



<p>"Hanatsuki-san!?"</p>



<p>A gyaru with light hair was running towards me, carrying
a large paper bag.</p>



<p>"What are you doing here?" I said.</p>



<p>I was a little nervous because I felt inappropriate when
a beautiful gyaru came to the back of a simple school building. When I
panicked, Hanatsuki-san gave me the same smile she gave me when she invited me
to lunch in the classroom earlier.</p>



<p>"Why? I was the one who asked you to have lunch with
me."</p>



<p>"That's not it, I mean how do you know where I
am?"</p>



<p>"Because I've seen Shuuji eat here before. At that
time, you were staring at the bike and laughing when you guessed that the owner
of the bike was a person who likes to party, right?"</p>



<p>"Uwaa...."</p>



<p>Seriously? She was actually watching me....</p>



<p>I was shocked and embarrassed because I didn't expect
anyone to notice. When I twisted violently in my heart, Hanatsuki-san tilted
her head.</p>



<p>"Huh? Where is your food? You didn't buy
anything?"</p>



<p>"I forgot to... carry a purse," I said
hesitantly.</p>



<p>While I was preparing to be mocked and laughed at, she
actually gave an unexpected reaction.</p>



<p>"Thanks God!" she muttered in relief.</p>



<p>"Thanks...God?" I was confused.</p>



<p>In front of me, Hanatsuki-san took out a package with
contemporary patterns from the paper bag she was carrying and offered it to me,
saying, "Here".</p>



<p>"T-This is?"</p>



<p>When I accepted it with some hesitation, Hanatsuki-san
replied with a slight blush on her cheeks.</p>



<p>"It's a bento, more or less."</p>



<p>"B-Bento, huh?" I was surprised to hear her
unexpected words and raised my voice.</p>



<p>"Shuuji used to buy lunch at the cafeteria, right?
That's why I made a portion for Shuuji today, too."</p>



<p>"Hanatsuki-san, made this for me..."</p>



<p>An introvert like me getting lunch?! From the gyaru,
Miran Hanatsuki?!</p>



<p>"If you don't mind, will you eat it?"</p>



<p>"Uh, w-well! Thank you!" I said approvingly,
holding the lunch box carefully, though I still couldn't shake the shock myself.</p>



<p>"Then I'll sit here, okay?" she said, pointing
right next to where I usually sat.</p>



<p>There, Hanatsuki-san sat down and straightened her skirt,
then took out another bento box from the paper bag she was carrying. Her
attitude made me nervous, so I realized it was too late.</p>



<p>"Um..." This situation means that I am sitting
next to Hanatsuki-san and eating lunch with her, right? With a homemade lunch,
no less!</p>



<p>"What's wrong?"</p>



<p>"No, nothing. S-Sorry, I'm sitting a little to the
side!"</p>



<p>I, who had been silent on the spot because of the
unprecedented situation, hurriedly moved further away from Hanatsuki-san's
side. I sat a little more to the side than my usual position. Of course, our
distance increased. However, within a reasonable distance and not too rude to
the fiancée who made me lunch. That's my limit now.</p>



<p>"T-Thank you for the bento."</p>



<p>I thanked her again and unwrapped the package. In front
of me is a lunch box with calm colors. Meanwhile, Hanatsuki-san's lunch box was
pink and one size smaller than mine.</p>



<p>"It's new, so don't worry."</p>



<p>"Oh, okay&#8212;eh?" Does that mean she bought a new
lunch box for me? I couldn't ask out of shame, assuming it was wrong, but there
was a palpitating feeling in my chest.</p>



<p>On the other hand, I felt a look from beside me that
wanted me to see the contents immediately, and when I put my hand on the lid of
the lunch box and opened it - there were omelets, carrots, and octopus
sausages. There are also small tomatoes with discarded stems, potato salad, and
so on. The side dishes look more colorful and delicious than I imagined. In
addition, all of these dishes are not ready-to-eat, but rather homemade and
well prepared.</p>



<p>"Are these all... made by yourself?"</p>



<p>"That's right. But I don't know if it's delicious or
not&#8212;" Hanatsuki-san said it casually, but her cheeks and ears were
flushed. When I felt the gap between her usually striking and glamorous
appearance and her unexpected side up close, I felt my heart beat wildly.</p>



<p><i>"Itadakimasu."</i></p>



<p>I clasped my hands together and immediately popped one of
the side dishes from that lunch into my mouth. If she had gone that far, I
would have praised her even if it didn't taste good. However, it is not worth
worrying about because the dish is as delicious as it looks. Not too heavy and
not too light, the taste is just right. Moreover, this is the first homemade
lunch for me, who is used to ready-to-eat lunches from the store, and it makes
me feel good at once.</p>



<p>"It's very, very delicious!"</p>



<p>"Really? Thanks God."</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwm5V-cc90i74yxGYFzBC_5BTL2HDg-RrK3SguOW4elYYQURxkQP7nx0s4r0cZPmvkXdmlJMnNvagEMhXyp8YiR96uIymMGrUHqN37Kr3VJd9Dm5i_8jjCU5wNgixk_YwWlVgr5gAuH0dLZX9PDhdmykHW87cOzFDA-FuB6p7ysp2hdVtgVWVBe4EJeg/s2246/out%20(9).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2246" data-original-width="1598" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwm5V-cc90i74yxGYFzBC_5BTL2HDg-RrK3SguOW4elYYQURxkQP7nx0s4r0cZPmvkXdmlJMnNvagEMhXyp8YiR96uIymMGrUHqN37Kr3VJd9Dm5i_8jjCU5wNgixk_YwWlVgr5gAuH0dLZX9PDhdmykHW87cOzFDA-FuB6p7ysp2hdVtgVWVBe4EJeg/s16000/out%20(9).png" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;"><p>Upon hearing my heartfelt compliment, Hanatsuki-san's
eyes lit up and she stroked her chest at the same time. From her reaction, I
felt that she had tried so hard to make the meal, so my appreciation of her
lunch was doubled. Then the two of us began to eat lunch together. ....</p></div>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>After a while, a problem arose that puzzled me. That is,
conversation. Eating in silence was tasteless, but on the other hand, I didn't
have anything good to talk about. I kept looking for a topic, but the only
thing I could think of was the knowledge of otaku. After all, it wouldn't be
appropriate for me to talk to a gyaru about otaku stuff. However, just as I was
about to open my mouth to talk about the weather, Hanatsuki-san said, "Ah!
That's right!". </p>



<p>"I've been curious about this for so long!" she
continued.</p>



<p>"Y-Yes?" I straightened my back while imagining
what she would say, and Hanatsuki-san's cheeks turned slightly red.</p>



<p>"Shuuji, umm, you always use honorifics when you
talk to me."</p>



<p>"Honorifics?!"</p>



<p>"Isn't that weird?"</p>



<p>"Not really, w-well, but still..."</p>



<p>My experience in talking to girls is sorely lacking, not
to mention that Hanatsuki-san is a gyaru who is at the top of the school caste,
so it is natural and a must for me to use honorifics with her.</p>



<p>"But <b>back then</b>, you treated me normally, you
know..." Hanatsuki-san said in a sullen voice.</p>



<p>Back then? I tried to remember, but I don't know
when I treated her normally. Did we interact normally before?</p>



<p>I tried to ask her, but before I could, Hanatsuki-san
pointed at me and said, </p>



<p>"No honorifics from now on!"</p>



<p>"Ehh?"</p>



<p>"Because we are about the same age... and also
engaged," she said, her cheeks flushed, adding those last words shyly.</p>



<p>"Also, you can really call me by my first name, not
my last name, okay?"</p>



<p>"First name!?" I was surprised.</p>



<p>Calling a girl by her first name is a huge hurdle for an
introvert like me. It can be more stressful than speaking the usual language.</p>



<p>"You don't like it?" she asked.</p>



<p>"It's not that I don't like it, but&#8212;"</p>



<p>"You're using formal language again, aren't
you?"</p>



<p>"Uggh&#8212;"</p>



<p>Is this how the upper castes communicate to get closer to
each other? What's more, this gyaru who is my fiancée smiled
seductively when I was surprised and said, </p>



<p>"Hey, hey, if you don't mind, please call me
now."</p>



<p>"Call you?"</p>



<p>"Yup, with my first name, that's it."</p>



<p>I took three deep breaths and rounded out my
determination, "Mi, Miran, -san".</p>



<p>My remarks were as awkward as <i>Artificial Intelligence</i>,
which Hanatsuki-san replied to with her chuckle.</p>



<p>"You're so stubborn, right. You don't need to add
'-san', you know, call me more casually, okay? Let's try it again."</p>



<p>"Mi...Miran."</p>



<p>"Yes, Shuuji?"</p>



<p>"No, um&#8212;"</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0in 1.3pt;"></p><p>I didn't expect her to call me back, it made me so
awkward. Shyness and awkwardness enveloped me all at once, and I felt my face
heat up. Miran, who was my fiancée, smiled happily at my reaction, while I felt
very uncomfortable inside. I could not imagine what would happen if I called
her by her first name from now on. Especially the effect on me&#8212;.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>2</b></p>

<p>And that's how it is, and we've just finished lunch.</p>



<p>"Shuuji... What do you think about me being your
fiancée? Is it a nuisance to you?"</p>



<p>Suddenly, the person next to me asked me a question. When
I turned my head, I saw the look on Hanatsuki-san's face&#8212;or I could just call
it Miran's, who seems a little worried.</p>



<p>Although I am bad at communicating, I take this as a
serious question and try to say seriously and honestly what I feel.</p>



<p>"Honestly, I'm a little confused... but it doesn't
bother me, really."</p>



<p>Unlike me, Miran is an extroverted gyaru. Nevertheless,
she is a beautiful and considerate girl. To say that our engagement was a
nuisance was a very presumptuous thing to say. On the contrary, I thought it
would be me who would bother her, not her as a fiancée. Thinking back to what
had just happened in the classroom, I continued my sentence,</p>



<p>"But it would be nice if you didn't tell anyone at
school about our engagement."</p>



<p>I know exactly what I'm talking about after observing the
school situation for half a day. Miran is very popular with both boys and
girls&#8212;if people knew she was engaged to a loner introvert like me, her good
reputation would definitely fall. I don't want clouds like me to shade her, who
likes the sun that shine on everyone.</p>



<p>"Ah, I see," Miran muttered as if sighing.</p>



<p>A few moments later, "Then!" she said, clapping
her hands, then fumbling in her pocket to pull out her smartphone.</p>



<p>"Let's exchange contacts. Give me your REIN ID"


<p>"REIN?!"</p>

<p>I knew it was an application for sending messages, but I,
being a loner introvert, was unlikely to use such an application; in fact, I
had not downloaded it myself. Besides, my parents were already using REIN and
asked me to download it, but I wasn't interested and haven't done so until now.</p>



<p>In my opinion it's time to use REIN. I also felt a bit
outdated for not using a trending app, but that's over today. Under the
watchful eyes of my fiancée, I quickly downloaded the app. Then, with Miran's
help, we exchanged REIN IDs.</p>



<p>"Look, you can send stickers and stuff, you know. You can also call someone."</p>



<p>A cute cat sticker was sent to me.</p>



<p>"I've heard this before, but it's unbelievable. A
feature that can tell if a message has been read is also very useful," I
said.</p>



<p>"But sometimes it's a little tiring, though."</p>



<p>"Seriously?"</p>



<p>Perhaps because Miran has many friends, she has her own
difficulties with the advantages of these features. While thinking about it,
Miran lifted her face from the smartphone and smiled at me.</p>



<p>"Now I can contact Shuuji anytime, right?"</p>



<p>"Y-Yes, that's right&#8212;" I nodded my head
nervously. However, I don't know what topic I should discuss in this chat with
REIN. Maybe I should read something from a conversation guide book.</p>



<p>At this thought Miran's smartphone rang. It seemed to be
a message from REIN.</p>



<p>"My friend forgot to do her homework and she wanted
to copy the one I got. So I'll go back to the class first, okay?"</p>



<p>Miran smiled, put the newly wrapped lunch box in a paper
bag, and got ready to go back to the classroom. I thanked her again, "Um,
thanks for the bento, and thanks for the food."</p>



<p>"I'm glad you like it. I'll make it again!"</p>



<p>"Oh no, you don't have to do that! It must be
troublesome to make it!"</p>



<p>"No, really, it's not troublesome. In fact, it makes
me happy" Miran smiled and said shyly. "Let's have another meal
together," she continued.</p>



<p>I was so fascinated by her face that I only answered in
agreement after a while, and at that moment I unconsciously watched Miran's
back go back to the classroom.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b></p>



<p>Later, I also returned to the classroom at the end of the
lunch break. It was like a dream. I walked down the hallway with my heart
pounding.</p>



<p><i>"Oi! Wait!"</i> came a loud male voice from
somewhere.</p>



<p><i>"Wait!"</i></p>



<p>Who was he calling?</p>



<p>In my opinion, he was in a bad mood, so I was careful not
to attract attention as I walked down the corridor.</p>



<p><i>"Don't ignore me!"</i> the owner of the voice
grabbed my shoulder.It seems that I am
indeed the one being called.</p>



<p>"Um, what's up?"</p>



<p>When I turned around with a shocked expression on my
face, I saw a tall, handsome, and flashy guy staring at me. From the color of
his uniform tie, he was a senpai one year older than me, and I felt like I had seen
him somewhere before.</p>



<p>"Don't get it wrong, just because Miran-chan is nice
to you!"</p>



<p>The flashy senpai said as if to warn me. Hearing his
words, I remembered who he was. He was one of the flashy guys from the <span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">other class<span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;"> who
used to visit our class to follow Miran and her friends. That means, after
hearing about what happened during lunch, he deliberately went out of his way
to show this polite displeasure, right?</p>



<p>"Let me tell you, she is only talking to you because
you are a unique introvert, okay? Don't get it wrong by trying to get close to
her!"</p>



<p>Well, since the beginning of my sophomore year, I've
attracted a lot of attention, especially because of my interaction with Miran,
and it seems like she can't take it anymore after hearing what happened today.
Understanding this, certain words floated around in my mind.</p>



<p>&#8212;&#8212;It's boring!</p>



<p>Those flashy people often say boring and annoying words,
but today is the first time I understood the true meaning of the word. What's
more, I think the fact that students from other classes come to our class just
to see Miran and the others is much more annoying. But I'm not stupid enough to
say it.</p>



<p>"Hey, are you listening to me?"</p>



<p>"Uh, yes. I'll be careful."</p>



<p>In this situation, it would be better to obey him and
keep a low profile. After all, the basic ability of an introvert is not to be
easily provoked by emotions. After that, he said a few more sentences, but I
ignored him at all with an "Ah, yes". Although he was quite unhappy,
he just sniffed and left. At that moment, I once again felt that the flashy guy
was indeed annoying.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 1.3pt; margin-top: 0in; margin: 0in 1.3pt 0in 0in;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b><span lang="EN" style="line-height: 107%;">***</b></p>



<p>I returned to the classroom so that no one would notice
me. When I looked inside, Miran apparently wasn't there, and there were only
the extroverts doing their homework or those who looked sleepy. Quietly, I
entered the classroom without anyone noticing, but&#8212;</p>



<p>"Hey, wait a minute&#8212;!"</p>



<p>This time a girl called me. Two gyaru people who often
hang out with Miran call me and surround me.</p>



<p>"Do you have a relationship with Miran?" one of
them asks.</p>



<p>"I've been thinking for a long time that there's
something between you two...," the other one continued.</p>



<p>The two girls spoke to me one after the other. This time
the problem cannot be solved by the skills of an introvert alone! Just when I
was at a loss as to what to say, one of them gave me a look that woke me up.</p>



<p>"Oh yes, isn't this the first time we've
chatted?"</p>



<p>"That's right, yes. Since I've seen Miran
interacting with you so much, I was curious, you know."</p>



<p>Then the two laughing girls introduced themselves.</p>



<p>"I'm Hanako."</p>



<p>"I'm Adzuki. Hello~."</p>



<p>The gyaru who introduced herself as Hanako gave me the
impression that she had aa onee-san aura, while the one who introduced herself
as Adzuki gave me the impression of someone meek.</p>



<p>"Oh, I am... Shuuji Eizawa."</p>



<p>For the time being, I answer them with my own name, but
this matter is not over yet.</p>



<p>"So, what is your relationship with Miran?"
Hanako-san asked again, and I tried as hard as I could not to show any emotion
when I answered her.</p>



<p>"We don't have any special relationship."</p>



<p>"Eh~ that's impossible, right!" Hanako-san
looks at me suspiciously, while Adzuki-san also seems unconvinced.</p>



<p>"Miran's mood today is obviously different from last
week. There must be something going on."</p>



<p>"Even if you say so, I don't have anything to do
with it."</p>



<p>When I tried to play the role of an innocent person, they
still looked at me with suspicion.</p>

<img border="0" data-original-height="2254" data-original-width="1598" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEim0e3MFRHwskNOIMWDHyQ91SaZpEw7PzGpaUet5x_1Fz27iJ-O7EJrjLrmu-v15TC-YB5hh80HZBr_FXJ5q-1ttcVSnjOd1OvOywJUxSZiC-DzFtlC61Ky8qvvmVYNM59EMs2EriSXvZoU98y9RVxCFvwLTzv8M00DB7KFiVybxTcFMj7rTGwaQ7FUDw/s16000/out%20(10).png" /></a>

<p>Then, what happened next&#8212;</p>



<p>"Ah, seriously!" Hanako-san and Adzuki-san
looked in the direction of the entrance, then hurried away from me. They put on
normal faces as if nothing had happened. I was confused for a while, but soon
realized the reason.</p>



<p>Miran is back. She made eye contact with me for a moment
and smiled, then went straight to Hanako-san and Adzuki-san. Perhaps because of
their poor acting, they were a little awkward when they spoke to Miran, who
looked confused.</p>



<p>"What is it?"</p>



<p>"Eh, what do you mean?", "Oh yeah,
Miran-san&#8212;"</p>



<p>The two forced themselves to change the subject and
started their usual conversation. I had the feeling that it was only a matter
of time before they found out that Miran and I were engaged. Feeling the worry
by the gyaru's gaze, I went to my seat. However, I felt that I was being
noticed and looked around. That's when I noticed that the flashy guys were
looking at me.</p>



<p>"............" I was forced to take this all.
No matter what I do, those two gyaru will continue to chase me with questions.</p>



<p>If this continues, I might get involved with that senpai
again. Therefore, I must be careful not to attract attention again. I strengthened
my resolve and spent the rest of the afternoon concentrating on the lesson.</p>



<p>Engaged to Miran&#8212;was the day I felt the change in the
people around me and myself.</p>
