<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>I used to be an introverted otaku who was very
embarrassed to show myself around. But one day, I suddenly became the fiancée
of a gyaru. She belongs to the top caste of the school and is popular with both
boys and girls, the extroverted gyaru Miran Hanatsuki. </p>



<p>My life changed drastically because of this gyaru.
Originally, I wasn't interested in other people and didn't care much about my
own life. However, after interacting with my fiancée, I had more things to
think about, more things to worry about. Although I was very difficult at
first, I came to understand myself and Miran better. </p>



<p>Before, I was an indoor hikikomori who only did what I
liked. But after I met my fiancée, I was confronted with things I would never
do on my own, and I started to try new things. It was difficult at first, but I
discovered a lot of new things. </p>



<p>Because of my fiancee, Miran Hanatsuki, my world became
more colorful. Then, after the whole school found out that Miran was my
fiancée, my school life changed completely. For example, when I came to
school&#8212;I used to do an introverted maneuver where no one would greet me. </p>



<p>"Shuuji, good morning~"</p>



<p>"G-Good morning."</p>



<p>Miran was already at school and greeted me in front of
everyone without hesitation. Then&#8212;</p>



<p>"Yo, Miran's boyfriend~"</p>



<p>"This guy is so funny, he's trying to hide his
presence."</p>



<p>Miran's friends also started to greet me. </p>



<p>For example, during the break period. I completely hid my
presence and no one noticed me. </p>



<p>"Is that man really Miran-chan's boyfriend?"</p>



<p>"No, I heard he was her fiancée."</p>



<p>"Haaa!?"</p>



<p>That way, I received more and more envious and jealous
looks from the flashy boys.</p>



<p>Another example, in the hallway&#8212;Senpai, the annoying guy
who once at odd with me said. </p>



<p>"I'm sorry!"</p>



<p>It seems that he was very busy in club activities and
suffered a lot from his plummeting reputation, so he solemnly apologized to me.
</p>



<p>The biggest change of all is, </p>



<p>"Shuuji~"</p>



<p>The lunch bell rang and Miran came over to my seat. </p>



<p>"Here, Shuuji, your bento&#9834;."</p>



<p>"Oh, thank you!"</p>



<p>The bento I was given is a lunch box my fiancée made. She
used to give it to me in secret for fear of being discovered. But now, I can
proudly take it in the class. In fact&#8212;"Let's eat together &#9834;".
Miran took me to lunch with Hanako-san and Adzuki-san. </p>



<p>For me, who always eats alone, this is very
revolutionary. </p>



<p>***</p>



<p>But I am a loner, an introverted otaku who always fails.
Being the subject of constant criticism is not something I love. In the end, at
break, I pretended to be asleep and let the athletes pass me. At lunch, I would
quickly move to my favorite spot at the back of the school building to avoid
the noise. My introverted behavior hasn't changed. </p>



<p>"............"</p>



<p>However, I feel uncomfortable in this state, just like
before. I want to be a man worthy of being her fiancé, Hanatsuki Miran. </p>



<p>So, one day during a break, I stood up after seeing Miran
leave her seat. </p>



<p>"Hanako-san, Adzuki-san, can I talk to you for a
second?"</p>



<p>I called two of Miran's gyaru friends and made a request.
</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I was on my way to the meeting place. This is my second
date with Miran. However, this is different from the past. </p>



<p>"Okay, it's perfect."</p>



<p>I checked my reflection in the shop window and touched my
hair. Uncharacteristically, my bangs were combed up today and the other parts
were hanging down. Yes, I use hair oil. Miran's gyaru friends, Hanako-san and
Adzuki-san, taught me how to use it, even though I couldn't do it myself.
Apparently, using hair oil was more difficult than I thought, and I was still
at the beginner level. </p>



<p>"There is still time..."</p>



<p>Like last time, I was the first to arrive at the meeting
place. Because my hairstyle is different now, I have become more sensitive to
my surroundings. When I was about to take a deep breath in the corner to calm
down. </p>



<p>"Huh? Shuuji?"</p>



<p>A cheerful voice reached my ears, and it was the voice of
my fiancée, Hanatsuki Miran. </p>



<p>"For a moment, I didn't know who you were..."</p>



<p>Miran looked at my hair, which was covered in hair oil,
and then looked at me. I looked at her as she looked at me. </p>



<p>"For a moment I didn't know who you were
either."</p>



<p>Miran always wears flashy and glamorous clothes. But
today, she wore neat clothes with a delicate color. Combined with the
atmosphere, she looked like a different person. </p>



<p>"I tried to dress the way Shuuji liked... What do
you think?"</p>



<p>Miran said shyly. I remembered that she had once asked me
about the neat heroine outfit when we were at the anime store before, and then
I looked at her and told her honestly. </p>



<p>"You look beautiful," I said.</p>



<p>"Really? Then I'll dress like this from now
on."</p>



<p>Miran felt uneasy as she mumbled this. It is indeed
suitable for her, but then I honestly said my impression of Miran. </p>



<p>"But I like your old style too."</p>



<p>At first, I didn't like the flashy and glamorous gyaru,
but now I like Miran's appearance.There
was a part of me that felt Miran's neat clothes were not enough for me. </p>



<p>"Shuuji..."</p>



<p>Miran's cheeks flushed and I realized that I had said
something rather embarrassing, so I scratched my head. However, I can't do that
because there is hair oil in my hair. Miran saw me doing this and said to me
with a smile. </p>



<p>"Shuuji's hair looks cool."</p>



<p>"I use hair oil."</p>



<p>"It looks good on you!"</p>



<p>I was worried that it would look strange from Miran's
point of view, but I was relieved by the compliment. </p>



<p>"Thank you."</p>



<p>I thought I'd wear it to school from now on. When I
thought about it, Miran said to me, </p>



<p>"But I also like Shuuji's usual hairstyle."</p>



<p>"----"</p>



<p>She replied with the same sentence that I said, leaving
me shocked. After we stared at each other for a few moments, I extended my hand
to Miran and said,</p>



<p>"Well then, let's start our date."</p>



<p>"Yup!"</p>



<p>Miran's hands felt soft and warm as I took them. By
holding them, I went on a date with Miran.</p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"></span><p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"></span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMME9xDi_fMR9jWgfdTm0JWKRiFBzRKleKCW_RVg6Rkp-npJ1TCKXmYrKn1Dp8zz2wOFSI_2b-C6FJ4WIkgPxp-pZi5tsCJUAttzQIXIKWzBujoZ_w6-EZ07wdg9Ydk8PwjyOhGoZ28V7M0S3PvFDZNbVSsYjyb7ezQazI-N45zfadci-lSGvGPgURyQ/s2252/out%20(24).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2252" data-original-width="1594" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMME9xDi_fMR9jWgfdTm0JWKRiFBzRKleKCW_RVg6Rkp-npJ1TCKXmYrKn1Dp8zz2wOFSI_2b-C6FJ4WIkgPxp-pZi5tsCJUAttzQIXIKWzBujoZ_w6-EZ07wdg9Ydk8PwjyOhGoZ28V7M0S3PvFDZNbVSsYjyb7ezQazI-N45zfadci-lSGvGPgURyQ/s16000/out%20(24).png" /></a></span></div><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><br /> </span><p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Bonus Panel:</b><br /></span></p><p style="text-align: center;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiP6BWqrWzXr2bbdq5Yb4bfh8pf8iWGw_FnAjN0TTtzKYK4AGV9jHBmQKr5vfxUyW1H-lYmKv5YmpXo9ISkPjq82LWuIDYrWzlwsc5PjZ-SAuPLvozzVA8BZob_pGSdqyjCUwZUZHF0q9iR1rrE82BvQnnmhke8WUNq4Ni6F5Azadlloyb1AtVfj5tvFA/s2560/out%20(29)%20(1).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2560" data-original-width="1816" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiP6BWqrWzXr2bbdq5Yb4bfh8pf8iWGw_FnAjN0TTtzKYK4AGV9jHBmQKr5vfxUyW1H-lYmKv5YmpXo9ISkPjq82LWuIDYrWzlwsc5PjZ-SAuPLvozzVA8BZob_pGSdqyjCUwZUZHF0q9iR1rrE82BvQnnmhke8WUNq4Ni6F5Azadlloyb1AtVfj5tvFA/s16000/out%20(29)%20(1).png" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkNOp9gHIYX11YQ_CP0Ryz7C26K_XAfUbtsOY2VwomEBbhQgQPe45urBC7Y3QYRPs99rhOOsO9rs87deiHewjhGyd5GtfKQR1HlIJlDYEMoiIQZL28RR1gFYBvXxIc-ONfEV-e6dv_moQAS0bMkgupzkT3101rq9fKNJ1kcKIJhhcQSfLvPCxD4rhKJg/s2560/out%20(31)%20(1).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2560" data-original-width="1816" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkNOp9gHIYX11YQ_CP0Ryz7C26K_XAfUbtsOY2VwomEBbhQgQPe45urBC7Y3QYRPs99rhOOsO9rs87deiHewjhGyd5GtfKQR1HlIJlDYEMoiIQZL28RR1gFYBvXxIc-ONfEV-e6dv_moQAS0bMkgupzkT3101rq9fKNJ1kcKIJhhcQSfLvPCxD4rhKJg/s16000/out%20(31)%20(1).png" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUpetO71z3fh7zcEAArG0Ec_Ji627avmbXTDDrhqD_IWhYmulSVg9gmVyvePJYOK4jqSuqswf_zgLs_A5RsSOwG0xUETxC7LeJV6QTG_HAiNUzovVP6JqYxNzoN3FkykK83A8NOTOPAOmL3LUP0VYoZk8YBoHsCu3VrpCeqqpG7W5KPYKnreUCw8egOQ/s2560/out%20(30)%20(1).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2560" data-original-width="1816" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUpetO71z3fh7zcEAArG0Ec_Ji627avmbXTDDrhqD_IWhYmulSVg9gmVyvePJYOK4jqSuqswf_zgLs_A5RsSOwG0xUETxC7LeJV6QTG_HAiNUzovVP6JqYxNzoN3FkykK83A8NOTOPAOmL3LUP0VYoZk8YBoHsCu3VrpCeqqpG7W5KPYKnreUCw8egOQ/s16000/out%20(30)%20(1).png" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOD70w2WurKxbfAf795v3HTHZmGWqmQV2mrRJPkjDNNeylAsft1ukGXkFQ7wdEqiNUnx4sJcwTjeZtqUmIRvKkPBPMJZlj-A3D9wLvPFTu_slVuCP9R6beBqGOeQBYUipCkeRhy8IjT6TwMWyPPTEOs4vs2XVBj83T_R3CPQtaJdRoEiUIhNcsAZe4Fw/s2560/out%20(32)%20(1).png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2560" data-original-width="1816" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOD70w2WurKxbfAf795v3HTHZmGWqmQV2mrRJPkjDNNeylAsft1ukGXkFQ7wdEqiNUnx4sJcwTjeZtqUmIRvKkPBPMJZlj-A3D9wLvPFTu_slVuCP9R6beBqGOeQBYUipCkeRhy8IjT6TwMWyPPTEOs4vs2XVBj83T_R3CPQtaJdRoEiUIhNcsAZe4Fw/s16000/out%20(32)%20(1).png" /></a>
