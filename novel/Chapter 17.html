<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; The Adventurer Killer</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the end, Gold was the only one who stayed behind to drink with the bear
beastman group.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
and I returned to the inn we were staying at with the money we just got.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
usual, we cleaned our room with the "Infinity Gacha" card, took off
our gear, and relaxed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
seemed to be still upset about the earlier conversation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
dare them! Why are the guys on the surface world so vulgar! It's very
inappropriate for Dark-sama's living environment!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
understand how you feel, but calm down. Regardless of the incident with the
adventurers just now. So far, things are going according to our plan. Don't be
so uptight about it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Currently,
we've reached the snowfield on the fifth level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">By
supplying many ice magic stones, which are in great demand, we have raised our
adventurer rank from novice to a full-fledged adventurer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Apparently,
this is the fastest rank-up since the founding of this town. The dwarves in the
guild are surprised by the fact that we're human.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Besides,
there was some good news for us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"At
first, I thought it might be too big for me, but now that I know I can use the
Transfer card to go back to Naraku, everything is going well."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thanks
to the large size of the dungeon and the small number of adventurers who can
reach the fifth level, I almost didn't have to worry about being seen while flying.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dungeon was so large that I didn't need to worry about the other people's
presence.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
left the Yeti hunting to Gold and Nemumu on the fifth level snowfield and
returned to Naraku by myself.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
could spin the Infinite Gacha, check on the progress of Sasha the Elf's revenge
plan, and talk face to face with those in charge of Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
floor is a terrible place for adventurers on the surface world, but this is a
convenient dungeon for us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(...
Well, I'm wondering if asking Nemumu "please beat me" should be
considered as bad behavior)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
remembered the incident at the bar and started to laugh again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
not everything is going well.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, there are some problems.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
guess the problem is that it's hard to raise my adventurer rank by just
delivering more Ice magic Stones.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
can't believe they didn't raise your adventurer rank to A-level after they saw
Dark-sama's success. The guild staff's eyes are not as good as they should
be."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Regardless
of guild staff's eyes, if they say I can't raise my rank because I just became
an adventurer a few days ago, I have no choice but to accept it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Adventurer
ranks are determined by the guild.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Generally
speaking, the rank is based on one's ability, contribution, time as an
adventurer, and behavior.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thanks
to the delivery of the Ice Demon Stone, my contribution to the guild is high.
But they told me that my experience as an adventurer is not long enough.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We'd
like to promote Dark-sama and the others to Class C right away, but your time
as adventurers is too short to do so. If you've made achievements that are
recognized by the people around us, we can push your promotion
through......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Delivering
ice magic stones is also a typical job for adventurers, although the level of
difficulty required may vary.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
expected, it is difficult to rise to C class with this alone.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Normally,
it's required 3 or 4 years, but if you continue to be an adventurer for another
year, we can raise you to C class. It's difficult for us to do something more
than that... Are you angry? You're not angry, right? You're not angry and want
to go to another city, aren't you!<span>
</span>Please, don't abandon us!<span></span>I will
do anything!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Towards
the end, the dwarf receptionist pleaded with me with tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
expected, I couldn't argue with her about the institutional difficulties, so I
backed down.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
recalled the conversation and gritted her teeth.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That
receptionist, her eyes changed when she looks at Dark-sama.... so
shameful."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
don't think she looked at me differently... I think she's just worried that we
may move to another dungeon."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
I know she's a woman too. That receptionist looks at Dark-sama differently.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though you hide your face with a mask, you have dark hair like a dark night,
white skin like a snowfield, and a more beautiful voice than a heavenly harp.
There is no way that a woman won't be attracted to you! Dark-sama should be
more aware of your own cuteness. Not just the receptionist, but also any female
adventurer who calls out to you, don't simply follow her."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
spoke as if she were an older sister warning her younger brother to be careful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
fact, in order not to forget my revenge, I fixed my body to 12 years old, and
Nemumu looks like she is around 18.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
from a third person's point of view, we may look like a brother and sister, but
we are already 15 years old in reality.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
is not old enough to warn me not to follow strangers, but she is worried about
my safety and sincerely gave me advice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
think I should just accept her advice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yeah,
I'll be careful."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you for taking my advice. Please rest assured that I will always be by your
side to ensure Dark-sama's safety. I will definitely protect you with my
life."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">ã€€</span><span class="calibre13">She
was happy that her advice had been listened to and got a chance to express her
loyalty.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, I'm happy for their loyalty, but sometimes it's a little too exaggerated.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(It
would be nice if you all could loosen up a little more. ......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is not something that I can order them to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
breathed out lightly and changed the subject.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
it's about time, so why don't you order as usual and get the food from
downstairs?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Roger
that...... I know it's necessary, but having to pay for food that tastes worse
than Naraku makes me feel like I'm losing money."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hahaha,
that's true, but we still have to eat."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
we want to, we can go back to Naraku and eat the food we got from the
"Infinite Gacha" card.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
it would be unnatural for us to stay in a luxury inn and not eat a single meal.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
when I returned to the inn to stay, I always ordered food whenever possible.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
Nemumu said, the food in Naraku is better thanks to the ingredients and
seasonings from the Infinity Gacha cards and the chef who cooks for us. Still,
this place is a heaven compared to when I was a poor farmer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
remember my hometown and say.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dad
and Mom would give their food to Nii-chan, me and my younger sister, Yume.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
it wasn't enough, so they drank water or went into the forest to eat whatever
they could find. But still, sometimes we couldn't find anything to fill our
stomachs. Nemumu, you know what? When you get too hungry, you don't feel hungry
anymore. Compared to those times, I'm really grateful to be able to eat."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama,
I'm sorry to hear that......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
some reason, Nemumu put a handkerchief over her eyes and sobbed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
didn't mean to make her sad, but.......</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Was
the story too sad for a girl like Nemumu?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Donk,
donk!" </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There's
a knock on the door.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
had a handkerchief pressed to her eyes, but she quickly put it away and took a
precautionary stance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
knew from the signs that Gold was outside the door, but I put on my mask again
just in case.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
making preparations, I nodded and urged Nemumu to open the door.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
she opens the door, a familiar golden armor enters the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
steps were a bit rushed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
closes the door, waits a moment, and I remove my mask.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You're
back quite early for a drinking party. Did something happen to you?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
expected of my Master, you have a sharp eye. Actually, there was an interesting
conversation topic at the Adventurer's Guild."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
says that while he was having a drink with the beastmen, the guild announced a
series of "adventurer killings" targeting adventurers inside the
dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is no information on race, age, or appearance, but it seems that the victims
are mostly human.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
magic stones, monster materials, minerals, and medicinal herbs found in the
dungeons are important resources. The guild could not overlook the possibility
that the number of adventurers going into the dungeons to get them would
decrease.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
would be like pouring sand on their own food.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
why they put a bounty on that adventurer killer.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We
get a good amount of money just for the information about the killer, but for
us, money is not important. Instead...."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"So
you came back in a hurry because if we catch the Adventurer-Killer first, it
will help us raise our class?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
a good point. With my Lord's blessings, it won't be too difficult to identify
the Adventurer Killer, will it?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hmm,
I don't know. Many powerful cards came out of the Infinity Gacha, but none of
them can be used to directly identify the killer. But if everyone cooperates
and utilizes the cards effectively, it should not be difficult to find the
adventurer killer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
example, I return to "Naraku" once and increase the number of our
search team.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
we hide our presence with "SSR, Conceal presence" and fly around in
the sky with "SR, Fly", the possibility of discovering
"Adventurer Killer" is very high.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then
let's return to Naraku immediately---huh!?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">ã€€</span><span class="calibre13">Dark-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
interrupts our discussion and shouts.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Almost
at the same time as her warning, we also notice something strange. I put my
mask back on, and Gold takes up a position to protect me with his shield, ready
for battle!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
space in the room distorts, and something appears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
first, it was a faint shadow, but then it took the form of a person covered in
blood and slowly fell to the floor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Miya-chan?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
girl who fell unconscious on the floor is the girl I had given the SSR Praying
Misanga to.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
misanga on her left hand was torn and fell off as if it had finished its role. </span></p></div>
