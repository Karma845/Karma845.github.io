<h1>Epilogue</h1>
<p class="calibre3">It was a beautiful day to leave. There was a little rain last night, but it cleared up in the morning. From the looks of it, it was going to be a beautiful day. Senterio peeked into the stables. Calavera was talking to the horse's caretaker. The horse with the best coat was the former lord's horse――and now Hiroto's horse. </p><p class="calibre3">"How are you getting ready to leave?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">To Senterio´s question, </p><p class="calibre3">"Anytime"　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera answered.</p><p class="calibre3">"Get the horses ready" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio started to walk and the caretaker followed him with the horses. As they reached the castle building, they saw the three of them. Souichirou, the Diferente. Mimia, the mummy girl. And Hiroto, the castle lord he served. </p><p class="calibre3">"Can we leave now?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio nodded at Hiroto's words. Is it good luck? Is it mercy? He had expected to be thrown into the dungeon, but he was not blamed. Senterio still didn't know why they hadn't detained him. Hiroto picked up Mimia first, followed by himself on horseback. Souichirou followed suit.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm going to check out the school" </p><p class="calibre3">"Please give this to the elf child" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio held out an ink pot and a quill. </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe I won't give it" </p><p class="calibre3">"Please be sure to give it to him. I don't care what anyone says, Solm needs elves"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll give it to the vampires"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled and lightly tightened the horse's belly. The horse started to walk away. Senterio followed behind. On the way, they could see the fields inside the castle. The soil was black because it had been bathed in plenty of water. The wells inside the castle also gushed out water in abundance. The main gate of the castle came into view. The soldiers opened the gate. As soon as they left the castle gate, they turned left. There, they saw the town square. Women were gathered there, happily drawing water from the well. There were skeletons and mummies nearby. Senterio paused, his mouth hanging open. </p><p class="calibre3">(Stupid......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto and his group also stopped their horses. Approaching was a man straddling a white horse. The man had large ears. Big long ears that stand out from his hair. Characteristic ears that only a certain race has. It was an elf that was on board. </p><p class="calibre3">"I have something to ask"　</p><p class="calibre3">The elf called out. </p><p class="calibre3">"I am Alvi, an elf. I came here because I heard a rumor that there is a castle lord who has appointed a mummy as his caretaker. Is there such a castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes"</p><p class="calibre3">When Hiroto answered, the elf was surprised and took off his hat to show his gratitude. </p><p class="calibre3">"You´re young. The mummy girl is――"</p><p class="calibre3">"This girl"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto introduced the Mimia. </p><p class="calibre3">"This is a lovely girl......indeed, this should break the curse of the spirits in no time"　</p><p class="calibre3">The elf admires.</p><p class="calibre3">"If you don't mind me asking, I'd love to talk to you――"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked at Calavera. It was just before they left for Secondaria. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do we still have time?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Plenty" </p><p class="calibre3">"Then to the castle" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto turned his horse around. Souichirou followed him.</p><p class="calibre3">(This is ridiculous......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio´s mouth is wide open.</p><p class="calibre3">(This is the first time......an elf came to this town......the castle lord invited an......elf......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">That's impossible. The people of Secondaria who visited them the other day told them that mummies were disgusting and that they could not introduce them to elves. And yet, the elves themselves had come....... </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you doing, Senterio-dono? Shouldn't you go back and make your preparations first?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera told Senterio who started to run in a hurry. Hiroto is talking with the elf, side by side with his horse. Passing by that side, Senterio jumped into the castle. After jumping in, Senterio was suddenly filled with joy and shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hospitality! Get ready for hospitality! There's an elf! Get ready for hospitality～～～～!!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">As he shouted, he was filled with even more joy. The elves had finally arrived. The elves had come. His wish had come true. And it was the young castle lord who had made that wish come true. He doesn't want to admit it. He doesn't want to admit that he owes it to him. But the reason the elves came to this town was because that man put a mummy girl as his caretaker.</p><p class="calibre3">(That cheeky youngster......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Even though he tried to suppress it, Senterio couldn't help but feel his cheeks slacken with glee and respect.</p>
