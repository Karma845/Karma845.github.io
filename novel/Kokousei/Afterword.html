<h1>Afterwords</h1>

<p class="calibre3">Congratulations on your resurrection after two years of hiding. Hello, this is Hiroyuki Kagami. I just finished checking the proofs,</p><p class="calibre3">"I just realized that I hadn't written an afterword"</p><p class="calibre3">It's like finishing an exam and realizing that you forgot to write your name. I don't care how much it's afterwords, it's too much to write afterwards. It's not an afterword, it's an afterthought, isn't it? Actually, it's easiest to write postcards right after you finish a manuscript, when you're most excited. When you write after a long time has passed and the tension has gone away, it becomes the hardest. And now, I'm in the world of super-hard. When I spray on a hair set, it's all set. But in the world of writing, I can't get it right......! This time, it's a medieval European-style fantasy. For those of you who know me Hiroyuki Kagami from the world of erotic games.</p><p class="calibre3">"Kitakitakita~~!"</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe. It's a story about the protagonist who is sent to another world and gets sandwiched between two girls with big tits and gets a good taste of it. No, it's not the same. I'll tell you how it's different in the text. This commercial can be skipped after four seconds. The first project was quite different from the current one, as there was no Valkyria and there was a senior woman on our side of the world. I finished it in August last year, said it was boring, made some major changes and here we are. Thank you, Editor H. This time, the illustrations are by Goban-sensei. The first thing I thought when I heard from the editor was, "I have his manga. Goban-sensei, please sign my copy sometime. In the second volume, that person will appear. I don't get it even if you say so. I don't know either. That's why I'm going to end with the usual phrase!</p><p class="calibre3">Ji～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～ku・Boin!</p><p class="calibre3">https://twitter.com/boin_master </p><p class="calibre3">Hiroyuki Kagami</p>
