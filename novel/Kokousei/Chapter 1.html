<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1: Diferente</h2>
<p>1</p>
<p class="calibre3">A relentless heat covered the whole of Japan. The heat of the sea area has also been over 30 degrees Celsius since 9 am. During the daytime, it is still raging. The two-story clubhouse built behind the school building of Doushinen High School was also burned by the sweltering heat and might even have mirage. No students can be seen during the summer vacation, so Room 101 on the first floor is open because it's the activity day of the Medieval Study Group. A dull gray office desk and four folding chairs in the space of about three tatami mats. A medieval hat with an elongated cone and pointed armor that seems to be handmade. The gray steel shelves are lined with medieval books, such as the works of Huizinga and Fernand Braudel. Souichirou must have brought that an elf's art book is mixed in with the lofty scholarly books. Big breasts and blonde hair are Souichirou's favorite. It would be perfect if the ears were big and pointed. </p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto Kiyokawa had just arrived at the club room at 13 o'clock a minute ago. Both school-designated black pants and white shirts are moist with unpleasant sweat. Hiroto took out his smartphone and checked his mail. He has not been contacted by Souichirou. Hiroto drank hypotonic water, chilling his neck with a wet towel. Expand the 『The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People』. It is a best-selling business book with a cumulative total of over 20 million copies sold worldwide. It is one of the most famous personal development books in the world. When I started reading the last chapter, I heard a noise outside the club room.</p><p class="calibre3">"Its that book again"</p><p class="calibre3">A 180-centimeter tall Megane――a first-year high school student who looks good in a lab coat stood there sweaty. Souichirou Aida――he was in the same first-year class B as Hiroto. At the entrance ceremony, he read the ceremony on behalf of the new students. In other words, he is the head of new students. In his hand he holds a thin paper bag and a plastic bag from a second-hand bookstore.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going to become the president of a company or something?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou turned his contempt on Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought it would be interesting to stand above people"</p><p class="calibre3">"There is no way you can do that"</p><p class="calibre3">After spitting it away, Souichirou threw his result sheet on the desk. A highlighter is painted in the first column. It was Souichirou's name that was marked.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm in first place again"</p><p class="calibre3">Brag.</p><p class="calibre3">"Amazing"</p><p class="calibre3">「It doesn't have your name」 emphasizes Souichirou on purpose.</p><p class="calibre3">"The one who can't make it to the 30th place is an idiot. There is no way that morons could become a president of a company? Keio University has the most presidents among some listed companies on the stock exchange, followed by Tokyo University and Waseda University. Can you do it?"</p><p class="calibre3">As usual, he spat out his favorite poison tongue.</p><p class="calibre3">"I think studying is different from presidential work"</p><p class="calibre3">"What's the difference!?"</p><p class="calibre3">To Souichirou, who snaps at him,</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it studying to accurately output a lot of information in a short period of time? I think a president is thinking about what to do with the company and how to move employees"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto replied.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's how you always argue with people"</p><p class="calibre3">"You're saying the wrong thing"</p><p class="calibre3">"A quibbler"</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh dear", Hiroto thought. Whenever he thinks he has been defeated, Souichirou always accuses him not to quibble. It hadn’t changed since elementary school when we were playing with my little sister. He must be dissatisfied. When his stress increases, Souichirou routinely throws his poison tongue at Hiroto. Souichirou put his bag on his office desk and sat down facing Hiroto. He takes two paper packs of apple juice from the plastic bag and puts one in front of Hiroto. Immediately Hiroto and Souichirou drank juice. The clubhouse where only two men were around was somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p class="calibre3">"Will Souichirou become a president of a company?"</p><p class="calibre3">When Hiroto asks,</p><p class="calibre3">"I prefer being a university professor. I refuse to be a salaryman"</p><p class="calibre3">"But university is very insular. It's a narrow relationship of only ten people, only professors, associate professors, assistant professors and graduate students. It seems that you can't make much money until you become an associate professor. Also, the lecturers from other universities live from hand to mouth"</p><p class="calibre3">"Who knows when you're going to get caught with a company's restructuring if you enter one now. And if your performance drops, you will be passed to sales"</p><p class="calibre3">"University instructors also have many one-year contracts, so it seems difficult to settle down as an associate professor somewhere"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't break people's dreams"</p><p class="calibre3">"You should just enter a company and go to the overseas division"</p><p class="calibre3">"No. The current overseas business division is China or India? I like Europe. That's why I joined the medieval study group. However, in the Middle Ages, Europe was a backward country"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou proudly curled his lips.</p><p class="calibre3">"The hygiene system was terrible and there was no sophisticated bureaucracy or standing army that China and Islam had at that time. It was only around the absolute monarchy that Europe could develop a regular army. There was no regular army and every war gathered mercenaries. It was Napoleon who created the national army"</p><p class="calibre3">He looks at Hiroto as if he doesn't know it.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's why you like blonde elder sisters?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Noisy"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou put the paper bag with the name of a second-hand bookstore on his desk.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's the blonde sister's DVD?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Fuck you"</p><p class="calibre3">"Elf art book?"</p><p class="calibre3">Without answering, Souichirou pulled out a transparent plastic bag. The content was an old-fashioned piece of paper. It's quite yellow. A map is drawn on it.</p><p class="calibre3">"What's this?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't you know?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou makes a silly voice.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's parchment"</p><p class="calibre3">"Parchment?"</p><p class="calibre3">"It was sold at a second-hand bookstore called Kaikoudou. Maybe it's real"</p><p class="calibre3">It seems to be a real map of medieval Europe. Souichirou took out the parchment from the plastic bag. Spread it on the gray desk. Then he traced the map with his fingertips.</p><p class="calibre3">"Look here. It says 「ELF」 in the medieval typeface"</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it a fake? Why is it singular? Normally, don't you write 「ELVES」 in plural? 「HYBRIDE」 is written here"</p><p class="calibre3">"Hybrid?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Hybride! It's German"</p><p class="calibre3">"After all it's a fake"</p><p class="calibre3">It was just after Hiroto rushed in. Even though the wind wasn't blowing, the door of the club room closed with a loud noise. Then they heard the sound of locking. The two turned their faces to the closed door. They were doing psychic art and it was like when something came down. </p><p class="calibre3">(Did anyone close it?)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto, who was about to confirm, was controlled by Souichirou's humming voice. The desk was emitting strong light like magnesium, which suddenly had a chemical reaction.</p><p class="calibre3">"W, What's, this!?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou is in a panic.</p><p class="calibre3">"W, What? Some kind of magic trick?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto picked up the parchment and looked at the back. At that moment, the light from the map swallowed them――in the room. Around, the inside of the head became pure white. They were about to be swallowed by the light, but it wasn't dazzling. With their eyes open, their vision turned white one after another――the consciousness had disappeared.</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Hiroto regained consciousness with the feeling of being hit by something. A smoky smell――is it the smell of grass? When he woke up, it was hay. Before he wondered why, he heard a pig cry, followed by a cow cry.</p><p class="calibre3">(What, what, what......!?)</p>

<p class="calibre3">When he turns his head to the side, Souchirou is lying on his stomach. Hiroto raised his body with his arms and spat. </p><p class="calibre3">"What the hell is that......!?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it a ranch around Kyushu or Hokkaido?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is there any teleportation!"</p><p class="calibre3">The loud voice of Souichirou was overlaid with human footsteps and metallic sounds. It was two knights who approached with a noise.</p><p class="calibre3">(Cosplay!?)</p><p class="calibre3">For a moment, Hiroto thought so. It doesn't seem that he was taken away by a UFO. He is sure they teleported to a ranch somewhere. They happened to be cosplaying there――or a medieval party? For that reason, it was strangely murderous. He's afraid of the eyes peeking through the helmet.</p><p class="calibre3">(Are they hostile?)</p><p class="calibre3">In cosplay, he doesn't feel this kind of murderous intent. If he looks closely, the face inside the helmet isn't Japanese. It's a real white face.</p><p class="calibre3">(No way, teleport to a foreign country?)</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as he thought,</p><p class="calibre3">"Pig thief!"</p><p class="calibre3">One knight shouted.</p><p class="calibre3">"No, I'm not a pig thief!"</p><p class="calibre3">They both say the same words together. One knight pulled out his sword. The sound when he pulled it out was strangely vivid.</p><p class="calibre3">(Eh? Sword!?)</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou screamed. He is trying to escape from the hay, but his hips are crumbled.</p><p class="calibre3">(No way, you don't swing the sword down, right?)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto saw three knights. After all, it is the face of Westerners. However, Hiroto thought that he was able to communicate even though he should have spoken in Japanese a while ago. He may not be thinking about that, but for some reason, he doesn't feel tense. No frustration or despair will come, whether it's dangerous or he is dying.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm Nut Your Enemy, Aima Japanese!"</p><p class="calibre3">Desperately, Souichirou shouted. The knight stopped once.</p><p class="calibre3">(Is it effective?)</p><p class="calibre3">It wasn't. A knight has approached with a stern look. As he walks, he wields a sword with one of his arms. Souichirou hid behind Hiroto. The knight raises his sword.</p><p class="calibre3">(No way, this is a death flag? I don't feel like dying at all......)</p><p class="calibre3">But doesn't he feel dead? Will he die here? Will he be soil on hay that he doesn't understand? Hiroto saw the knights in slow motion. He heard the sound of hoofs. The knight shouted something and from behind,</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't kill! That person is a Diferente!!"</p><p class="calibre3">It was a skeleton that was riding a horse that jumped in.</p>
