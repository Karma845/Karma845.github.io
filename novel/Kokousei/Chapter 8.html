<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 8: Parchment</h1>
<p class="calibre3">1</p><p class="calibre3">After watching Hiroto and Souichirou leave the castle under the protection of Calavera, Senterio returned to his room. That young man. What's with the mummy? What's with the ban on the ,ummies? What's the point of doing that? It will only keep the elves away from this town. This town will be left behind in development forever. It will be ridiculed forever. Every time he goes out, he will be ridiculed. He won't let that happen. He can't go through that kind of frustration any longer. He's going to announce it while the new castle lord is on his inspection tour. He'll announce it to the inhabitants of Solm. Senterio opened his drawers. The first thing he remembered was that it didn't feel right. He is sure he put it at the top, but did he put it at the bottom? He looked in it. ――It's not there. </p><p class="calibre3">(No, I thought I put it here......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">It's still not there. </p><p class="calibre3">(This is ridiculous) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He rifled through the contents of the drawer. He pulled them out one by one. </p><p class="calibre3">(N......No!!)</p><p class="calibre3">His mind went completely blank. He had talked to the knights yesterday and he thought he had put it in here. But why isn't it here? </p><p class="calibre3">(Maybe I put it in the safe?)　</p><p class="calibre3">He opened the safe, but all that was waiting for him was the silverware. </p><p class="calibre3">(No way......stolen......!?)</p><p class="calibre3">At that time, he stopped trying to put it in the safe, but he knew he should have put it in the safe......!?</p><p class="calibre3">"Someone! Someone!!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shouted loudly. His knights showed up. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did you open this?" </p><p class="calibre3">"No!" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's not here!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe it was placed somewhere else――"</p><p class="calibre3">"I haven't touched it since! Who opened it!"</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights shook their heads. </p><p class="calibre3">"Find it! No matter what it takes, find it!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shouted. Urkan was dead. He can't ask him to sign again. That young man? He doesn't believe that a man who would take a mummy girl as his caretaker and override the mummies' ban on living in the city would sign a document that lays out an elven favoritism policy. </p><p class="calibre3">"Call the garrison soldiers! All of you, split up and find the missing document!!"</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">After hanging up all the sheets and bedding on the balcony, Mimia looked up at the blue sky. It was like a dream. The mummies had always been the outcasts of this town. A mummy like herself was the caretaker of Hiroto-sama, the castle lord. In addition, she was given beautiful clothes that she has never worn before. She didn't mind the bandages, but as a girl, she longed for the clothes worn by humans. Mimia looked at her sleeves. She looked at her skirt. She spun around. It was fun to see the skirt spread out, so she spun around some more. She felt like she was going to fall over. But that dizzy feeling was also fun. From now on, she can wear clothes like this every day. And she can be by Hiroto-sama's side. She'll be able to take care of him. She heard from the garrison captain Calavera that she would be riding with him. She will accompany him to Mora village. It is her first time to ride a horse. It's also with Hiroto-sama......!</p><p class="calibre3">(Hiroto-sama......♡) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia thought of the young castle lord.</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">A pleasant blue sky looked down on Hiroto and the others. Following the leading guard, Calavera led the horses forward. Then Hiroto, astride his chestnut-haired horse and Souichirou, holding the reins with reluctance. Behind them, two guards on horseback followed. As Hiroto gripped the reins, he was in agony from the pleasure that was coming from his back. From behind, Mimia is snuggling up to his body.</p>

<p class="calibre3">(It, It feels good......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">It was the first time he had ever been in close contact with a girl his age. He's held hands with girls in his class in dance class, but he's never had breasts pressed against him. As the horse walked, Hiroto and Mimia's bodies swayed. At the same time as they swayed, a pleasant bulge poked his back. Each time, the elasticity of her body erupted. It was a blissful time. The taut, youthful bulge poked his back, sometimes strongly, sometimes weakly, with varying degrees of force. When Mimia re-captured Hiroto's body, the tip of her lightly touched breasts made a sensual grounding curve against his back and Hiroto almost squirmed. </p><p class="calibre3">(Feels good......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia also brought her body closer than before. The two boobs were crushed and pushed apart, spreading their elasticity. Her breasts were so large that they protruded from Mimia's torso. </p><p class="calibre3">(Great volume......!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto salivated. It's not a breast pouch, it's a boob balloon. </p><p class="calibre3">(It's a good thing I'm the castle lord......!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought strongly. If possible, he wants to look back and hug her head-on. But――he is sure that if he did that, he would be turned over before he could be criticized. The gates of Solm Castle opened with a loud bang. </p><p class="calibre3">"The castle lord is coming! Open the front!"</p><p class="calibre3">The lead guard shouted as he headed into the town. The men and women near the gates turned to look at Hiroto and the others. Hiroto waved his hand lightly. There was no response.</p><p class="calibre3">The line of sight was slightly off Hiroto. What they were concentrating on was the back of Hiroto's head――Mimia.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Calavera! Who's that girl?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A man who seemed to be a tailor approached Calavera. </p><p class="calibre3">"She is the caretaker"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ca, Caretaker, that mummy!?"</p><p class="calibre3">Surprised, he looks back at Mimia.</p><p class="calibre3">"He. This is a mummy? Changed radically～"</p><p class="calibre3">The tailor shouted loudly. The women of the town rushed forward. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is this the mummy girl?" </p><p class="calibre3">"She's prettier than a human. Pretty girl"</p><p class="calibre3">The women's words made Mimia blush. Hiroto was feeling a little proud. See? Everyone thinks she is cute, right? He thought she was cute from the start. She also has big boobs. One by one, the townspeople gathered along the street. Both men and women wore tunics, a single piece of clothing in the shape of a tube. Their bosoms were not so well hidden. The woman's tunic was short and their knees were peeking out. Underneath the tunic, the man wore tight-fitting pants that looked like spats. </p><p class="calibre3">"Castle lord! Hurry up and lift the curse!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A middle-aged man shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please make the well water flow!"　</p><p class="calibre3">A woman's voice continued. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'll do it!"</p><p class="calibre3">A cheer went up as Hiroto answered. Suddenly, a thin man shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you talking about? He's a stranger! He doesn't know us!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">It was a blast of cold water.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes! He made a mummy his caretaker! He doesn't want to help humans!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The other cynics agreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"I think he caught the vampire because he wanted to take credit, so he asked her to be captured!?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Someone threw a stone. </p><p class="calibre3">"Who just threw a stone!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera stepped forward. </p><p class="calibre3">"Even the skeletons are here! This town is going to become a town of monsters! Get out! Get out, you monsters!"　</p><p class="calibre3">A stone flies towards Calavera. Hiroto was disgusted. He kicked the horse's belly with his foot.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't go forward!"</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera said to Hiroto, keeping his eyes forward. </p><p class="calibre3">"What happens when the castle lord becomes the target?" </p><p class="calibre3">"What kind of lord keeps quiet when his subordinates are insulted?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Skeletons are more resistant to stones than humans. They won't be hurt by a hit to the face" </p><p class="calibre3">"But――"</p><p class="calibre3">The twisters shouted.</p><p class="calibre3">"Get out, skeletons!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Get out of here, mummy!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A stone flew past Calavera. Mimia clung to Hiroto. The human knights pulled their horses closer to Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">“To the church" </p><p class="calibre3">"I can't back down when my men are fighting"</p><p class="calibre3">"We're here to keep the castle lord safe" </p><p class="calibre3">Answer once and for all. If Hiroto looks closely, he can see that this is the knight who first attacked Hiroto and Souichirou when they first arrived in this world. </p><p class="calibre3">"I thought you were a stranger when I met you, but you're a great lord. There's no need to get hurt here. Quickly"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto felt a surge of joy. Hiroto nodded. He turned his horse toward the church. </p><p class="calibre3">"You're running away! You coward! You scumbag who sides with monsters!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A man grabbed a stone the size of a baby's head. And the townspeople pulled back. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hurry!"</p><p class="calibre3">The knight shouted. But the stone――didn't fly. It wasn't that it was too heavy or that the man had changed his mind. A strange cry heard from the church stopped the man. Was it Hyaaaa or Uwaaaaa. The next thing he knew, he heard a thud......people came running out of the church. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's lit......!"</p><p class="calibre3">One of them shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama is back!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">There was a loud groan. People were beginning to stream into the church. </p><p class="calibre3">"Into the church!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Led by the knight, both Hiroto and Souichirou hurried. Thanks to the crowd of townspeople, it was difficult to move forward. But when they realized it was Hiroto, </p><p class="calibre3">"It's the castle lord......" </p><p class="calibre3">"Castle lord......!"</p><p class="calibre3">They gave way to Hiroto. Inside the church, it was the same as yesterday. The brightness was almost the same. But there was a small light on the high pedestal. The light was about the size of a marble, but it was glowing amber. </p><p class="calibre3">“It's a spirit......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight gasped behind Hiroto. Mimia also opened her mouth. Hiroto proceeded to the pedestal as the townspeople opened the way. Waiting for him was the town priest. </p><p class="calibre3">"Castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest called out. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did the spirit come back?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Here――"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked up from underneath the pedestal at the spirit light. The light of the spirit, about the size of a marble, flickered on and off. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it completely back?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It is still checking on us. When it really comes back, this church will be filled with light. The town will be illuminated at night by the light of the spirit"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is there anything left?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Perhaps. But I can tell you this. Hiroto-sama is doing the right thing" </p><p class="calibre3">"The priest recommended me for the position of castle lord"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto held out his hand. The priest shook his hand back. Then Hiroto held out his hand to Souichirou as well. </p><p class="calibre3">"What?" </p><p class="calibre3">"A handshake. I think its back because Souichirou lend me his hand"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't you dare touch me like that"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou turned red and turned away. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not fit to be a......castle lord, I'd rather be a......professor......"</p><p class="calibre3">"But yesterday, you defended me. You told Senterio that I wasn't the cause of the problem. That made me very happy"</p><p class="calibre3">"I, I......wasn't trying to make you happy......"</p><p class="calibre3">While saying this, Souichirou became sluggish. Even his ears are bright red. Hiroto grabbed Souichirou's hand. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm glad you're with me" </p><p class="calibre3">When he said this, Souichirou blushed even more and shook his head. He mumbled something to himself.</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">4</p><p class="calibre3">In a tent, Valkyria was reading the parchment she had stolen. </p><p class="calibre3">"Elves, elves, elves"</p><p class="calibre3">She said, looking at it with a cold gaze. She doesn't know what an elf is. She is tempted to rewrite the entire text as a vampire. She looked at the date and saw that it was yesterday. </p><p class="calibre3">(Yesterday, right......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">She thought for a moment and then realized. Yesterday? Isn't that the day the previous castle lord died? </p><p class="calibre3">(Does he know about this?)　</p><p class="calibre3">She thought of Hiroto. Valkyria was surprised because she never thought that he would become the new castle lord. He is a ridiculous successor. She knew he was a smart guy, but....... </p><p class="calibre3">(Shall I tease him with this?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">She suddenly thought. Putting the parchment in the tube, Valkyria left the tent.</p><p class="calibre3">5</p><p class="calibre3">After leaving the Spirit Church, Hiroto and the others went around the town. There were more different races than they had expected. The mummies did most of the carrying and heavy lifting. It was the humans who made the bread, tailored the clothes, lent the money and did the business. Not a single elf was to be seen. There was a water mill, but it was not running due to low water flow. Instead, a few mummy men were pushing around a circular stone several meters in diameter. Calavera explained that it was a millstone. They were grinding wheat, he said. Mummies were very strong. Hard work is said to be the work of the mummies. As they passed through the gates of the town of Solm, they saw a group of mummy men taking a break after carrying their belongings. They were gathered in a group, talking in whispers. As Hiroto and the others approached, they turned their heads in unison. Mimia waved her hand. The mummy men looked at Mimia with a blank stare. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you know them?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia nodded. Didn't they notice that she had changed into human clothes? That was not the case. They delayed and waved their hands back hurriedly. Apparently, they had been gazing at Mimia. As soon as they passed through the town, Hiroto and the others turned their course toward a nearby village. Calavera approached with his horse. The sight of him filled Hiroto with joy. He had just become the castle lord and Calavera and the other knights had protected him. </p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you for earlier"</p><p class="calibre3">"I was just doing what is natural for a garrison. It is our job to protect the castle and the castle lord" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled. He was as happy to hear it as ever. Calavera must be a very good knight. </p><p class="calibre3">"It may rain. Let's hurry"</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">They rode on, but the rain came before they reached Mea village. There were no large trees nearby. There were only a few trees about five or six meters high, enough to shelter a horse in the rain. They had no choice but to split into several trees and take shelter from the rain. Hiroto was alone with Mimia. The rain inevitably brought back memories. The first time he met Mimia. Hiroto grabbed Mimia's hand and pulled her under the tree. That was the moment when it all began. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's raining again, isn't it?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He said to Mimia. </p><p class="calibre3">"Yes♪" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She replied happily. There was hardly any distance between them. Mimia is at a distance that can be easily hugged by turning his arm.</p><p class="calibre3">"I met Hiroto-sama thanks to the rain"</p><p class="calibre3">"I met Mimia thanks to the rain, too. Thanks to Mimia, I was able to capture the vampire and become the castle lord. If I hadn't gotten the bandage, I might have died of shock" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia looked at Hiroto happily. She has cute, beautiful eyes. And far below those eyes――big boobs. </p><p class="calibre3">(They're still huge) 　</p><p class="calibre3">If Hiroto lowers his gaze, he will automatically see the swelling of her breasts, which are very assertive. What a wonderful view. </p><p class="calibre3">(Should I hug her and try......?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He suddenly thought. The sensation of her chest when they were riding together came back to him and his head roared with excitement. It's easy to hug her. Mimia might not be offended. But he is embarrassed that she might see through his desire. There was a loud sound of water diagonally behind Mimia. With a cute squeal, Mimia's body slammed into Hiroto. Her ample breasts tickled Hiroto's chest. A burst of flesh caressed her breasts for a moment and then pressed down hard. The two nipples deformed, sending a surge of pleasure through Hiroto's chest. </p><p class="calibre3">(It feels so good......!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">His spine is tingling. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry......." 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia tried to pull away, but Hiroto reflexively hugged her. Her voluptuous milk balls further bounce on Hiroto's chest plate.</p><p class="calibre3">"You're getting wet"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia didn't try to move away anymore. She pressed her breasts against him as if she was relieved. Her ample nipples clung tightly to Hiroto's chest. Her boobs felt nice and mushy. He feels a mixture of pleasure and happiness. Hiroto looked at Mimia's hair from above. Hiroto was taller than her. He thought she was cute. He felt like he wanted to do something for this girl. Hiroto smiled and spoke to her. </p><p class="calibre3">"If they mention that you shouldn't live in the town, we will officially withdraw it and document it" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia looked down. She didn't seem too happy about it. </p><p class="calibre3">"Mummies can't live in the town......because they can't afford the rent"</p><p class="calibre3">"Still, there is no need to legally prohibit it"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto insisted. The rain was coming down harder and harder. The rain was so torrential that the neighboring tree about ten meters away was a blur. He can't see the subordinates who are separated from him and shelter from the rain under other trees. </p><p class="calibre3">"I wonder if I'm a rain man?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto joked. </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe I'm a rain woman......"</p><p class="calibre3">"If it's the both of us, are we heavy rain men and women?"</p><p class="calibre3">As they both laughed, they heard the sound of wings. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hiiii, I hate heavy rain"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked back and froze. The other party also froze. </p><p class="calibre3">"Why in such a place――"</p><p class="calibre3">"You too――"</p><p class="calibre3">It was Valkyria, the daughter of the vampire chief, who had jumped in to shelter from the rain. Mimia pulled away and tried to step forward. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's fine"</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going out together?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria made fun of them. </p><p class="calibre3">"My men are with me. You cant see them in the rain"</p><p class="calibre3">"If I kill you here, I'll be a hero. I'll be taking the head of the castle lord" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia's blood changed. Hiroto winked. </p><p class="calibre3">"Can you wait until the spirit's curse is lifted?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Can't wait"</p><p class="calibre3">"Did you wait yesterday? You came to the castle last night, right?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria fell silent. She stared at Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"When did you notice?" </p><p class="calibre3">"When I entered the room, I heard the sound of wings. Isn't that your sound?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You really are a sharp guy, aren't you?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria's pupils dilated and her eyes moved in a circular motion. She then brought her face closer and she gazed at Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't mind sharp people"　</p><p class="calibre3">She said and moved her eyes even closer. Hiroto, </p><p class="calibre3">"Did you come to get caught again today? Or do you have something for me?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He pointed at the tube. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's in it?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want to see?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria gave him a mischievous look. </p><p class="calibre3">"I want to see"</p><p class="calibre3">"If you let me suck your blood, I'll show you" </p><p class="calibre3">"Really?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto's face flushed. </p><p class="calibre3">"You're a funny guy, you know that? I've never seen anyone look so happy"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto rolled his arms. He sticks out his arm to let her suck his blood.</p><p class="calibre3">"Pri~zu"　</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as he said it, Valkyria suddenly hugged him. He didn't even have time to raise his voice. She was sucking blood from his neck, while Hiroto was wondering if her rich breasts were in close contact with his chest and a small pain ran in his neck.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6FSv937/000003.png" alt="" class="calibre6" />

<p class="calibre3">(Ge, Gee～!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto panicked. Will he die of shock? </p><p class="calibre3">"Hiroto-sama is going to die～!"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia is hitting Valkyria. But Valkyria put her arms around Hiroto's back and pressed her breasts against him. Whip. The breasts bounced even more. </p><p class="calibre3">(It feels good......, but that wasn't the case) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria's throat rumbled. While rumbling her throat, Valkyria presses and rubs her chest against Hiroto´s body.</p><p class="calibre3">(Uhaha......it feels good......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto wriggled his hips. He's not sure if this vampire is doing this on purpose. </p><p class="calibre3">(I might not die) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia was still hitting Valkyria. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm fine"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto made a peace sign. Immediately after that, Valkyria pulled away. </p><p class="calibre3">"Unlike the other guys, you're not going to die of shock" </p><p class="calibre3">"Too bad?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Too bad" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria laughed. She didn't seem to be disappointed at all. Mimia immediately took out a bandage. She wrapped the bandage around Hiroto's neck. Her large breasts touched Hiroto's body. </p><p class="calibre3">(That tickles......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He wants her to push her breasts more against him.</p><p class="calibre3">"I've brought you something interesting to show you"</p><p class="calibre3">"Something interesting?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria pulled a piece of parchment out of the tube. Hiroto froze when he received it. </p><p class="calibre3">"This is......"</p><p class="calibre3">"I got it from Senterio's desk. Look at the date on it"</p><p class="calibre3">"The date?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto noticed. The parchment was clearly marked with the date of Urkan's death. It is also signed by Urkan. There are also three clauses on it. </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't this nice?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Can I have this?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria smiled mischievously again. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'll give it to you if you let me suck on you again. Your blood is quite tasty"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia grabbed Hiroto's arm.</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, just a little"</p><p class="calibre3">"Just a little" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria pressed her breasts against Hiroto again. A lump full of elasticity pops on his chest. Valkyria's lips touched Hiroto's neck. Mimia's eyes rolled back in her head. She looked at Hiroto and Valkyria. Suddenly her lips formed a perfect line and she hugged him. She pressed her chest against Hiroto too. Valkyria and Mimia's huge breasts exploded onto Hiroto's body. Four voluptuous bulges rubbed against Hiroto's torso. They were both elastic in different ways. Valkyria's breasts puffed out softly and then pushed back against Hiroto's chest plate. Mimia's breasts filled up as soon as they touched and bounced back with a crackling elasticity. They are youthful, bouncy breasts. The different qualities of their breasts are pressed against Hiroto's chest and sides over and over again. Every time the texture of the voluptuous boobs stroke from the chest to the flank, the pleasant sensation that seems to melt comes from the depths of the body. Hiroto's face fell in love with them. </p><p class="calibre3">(Boobs feel so good~~!)</p><p class="calibre3">6</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as the rain stopped, a knight left on a fast horse from near Mora village. Four horses followed him. The riders were Calavera, his men and Hiroto and the others.</p><p class="calibre3">7</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio was in a bad mood. He had ordered all of the remaining knights in the castle to search for the document, but they couldn't find it. If he doesn't have it, he won't be able to push forward with the preferential treatment of elves. He questioned if someone had stolen it, but he said to himself no one had entered the room. The knights looked unhappy at being treated as criminals. He called the servants together, but none of them knew. They were too busy cleaning up after Urkan and other things to do that, they said. Senterio was about to snap. </p><p class="calibre3">(Who the hell is it......?) </p><p class="calibre3">(Is it that young guy?)</p><p class="calibre3">Just as he was thinking that, he received a call from the priest. He wanted him to come. Senterio told him he was too busy, but he said he had to come. Hiroto was also supposed to come to the church.</p><p class="calibre3">(This is a good opportunity. I'll see if he stole it) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio left Solm Castle.</p><p class="calibre3">8</p><p class="calibre3">From the entrance of the Spirit Church, a tall, narrow arcade――the nave extended to the inner sanctum where the spirit light was enshrined. Waiting for Senterio in front of the spirit light were Hiroto, the mummy girl, the priest, Souichirou and Calavera. The sun was already fading. It was dark inside the spirit church. The spirit light is still as big as a marble. Senterio looked at Hiroto. It was supposed to be a call from the priest, but it was probably an order from Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you doing summoning me here?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm going to prove it"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto answered. </p><p class="calibre3">"Proof?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">What is he going to prove? Senterio is busy. He has to get the stolen parchment back and announce it to the people of Solm. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is this what you're looking for?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto held out the parchment. Senterio's eyes nearly popped out of his head. 　</p><p class="calibre3">One, elves can enter the town without paying a toll. 　</p><p class="calibre3">Two, elves shall be given first-class land free of charge. 　</p><p class="calibre3">Three, the children of the elves shall be able to attend school in Secondaria for free. </p><p class="calibre3">"Why that――"</p><p class="calibre3">"The vampire gave it to me for my blood" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Vampire? The same vampires that took the lives of his parents are now trying to take his life! </p><p class="calibre3">"I want it back" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio held out his hand, suppressing his anger. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry, but I can't"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's something Solm needs"</p><p class="calibre3">"I won't accept it. We don't have any elves in this town"</p><p class="calibre3">"We need to issue that edict for the elves to come! Otherwise, the elves will――" </p><p class="calibre3">"What about the people who live in the prime locations? Where and how will they get the money to go to school in Secondaria? How are we going to tax the people of the town to pay for a non-existent elf?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto plunged in calmly. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's none of an stranger's business"</p><p class="calibre3">"I heard you signed it the day Urkan died"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio was startled. How does he know that? </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't this the reason?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I would appreciate it if you would stop complicating things. What do you want to do when you become the castle lord? Do you only want to get along with the mummies and the vampires and don't care about humans?" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's just a complication. If this is what you really need, why didn't you show it to me? I know what you said to your knights. Proclamation while I wasn't there. Don't show it to the castle lord!?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I didn't want to bother you, sir" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio explains while feeling cold sweat. </p><p class="calibre3">"It doesn't make any sense. You can reject the idea that it's none of a stranger's business or you can show compassion that you don't want to bother him. In the end, you just wanted to get this through without anyone getting in the way"</p><p class="calibre3">"It has to be passed through. You're a stranger, you can't possibly understand"</p><p class="calibre3">"I understand. I can't admit this" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto grasped both ends of the parchment. What is he going to do? Declare it invalid? Senterio won't let that happen. </p><p class="calibre3">"Take a good look at it. I'm going to prove it to you"</p><p class="calibre3">"Prove what?" </p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Hiroto put all his strength into it. The parchment was torn. Souichirou held out a candle. Senterio's mind went blank. </p><p class="calibre3">"Stop it! It's to call the elves――"　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera stopped Senterio. </p><p class="calibre3">"You are a skeleton and you dare to fight me!"</p><p class="calibre3">"By order of the castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">"You――!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The flaming parchment curls up and falls to the floor. </p><p class="calibre3">"Aaaaa......!"</p><p class="calibre3">The moment the desperate voice leaked out, there was a flash inside the church. The whole church flickered like a small explosion, regaining its brightness at once. It wasn't just that it was back. The spirit light shining more intensely and clearly than ever before. The church, which had been at dusk, shone as brightly as if it were daytime――or rather, as if it were daytime outdoors. The priest raised his voice. The knights and Calavera both looked back. Senterio, too, looked up at the elevation and froze. He couldn't believe his eyes. The spirit light had grown to the size of a baby's head, glowing with a dignified, strong light. Stupid......, Senterio exclaimed. Has the spirit's curse been lifted? Has the spirit light fully returned......? </p><p class="calibre3">"Proof complete"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled. </p><p class="calibre3">"The fact that the spirit light has become this strong after burning this pledge means that this town doesn't need an elf preferential policy. That's what the spirits are saying. They want us to get along with other races" 　</p><p class="calibre3">They heard a knock at the door. </p><p class="calibre3">"Priest, what's going on? Priest!"　</p><p class="calibre3">The door opened and the townspeople rushed in. They paused at the strong glow of the spirit light. For a moment, the words were lost. A delayed sigh escaped. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama......has returned......"</p><p class="calibre3">"The curse has been lifted......"</p><p class="calibre3">More townspeople poured in from behind and cheered. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-samaaa!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The townspeople shouted, hugged each other and danced on the spot. Loud voices could be heard outside the church. </p><p class="calibre3">"The water in the well is back!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">More dancing spread. </p><p class="calibre3">"Everyone! The curse has been lifted!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">At the sound of Hiroto's voice, everyone in the town gathered. Everyone who was present reached out to Hiroto. Hiroto shook the hands of the townspeople.</p>
