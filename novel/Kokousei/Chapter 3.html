<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 3: Mummy Village</h1>
<p>1</p>
<p class="calibre3">A stone wall, about thirty centimeters wide, cut through the thin land for several dozen meters. It was about a meter high. The man leaning against the wall, fiddling with his bow and arrow, was a soldier. He was an unfortunate man who had been dispatched to Mora's fort. There is a captain in the hut behind him, but he is most likely dozing off. Hopefully the Diferente will be here soon, the soldier thought. To be honest, it would be tough for the two of them to take on the vampire alone. It always came from the sky alone, but even with two of them it would be difficult to put up a good fight. The vampire attacks at night. And humans are weak at night and can't fly. The soldier readied his arrow. As he pointed it at the cloudy sky, it started to rain. </p><p class="calibre3">(Damn, it's raining) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The soldier aimed his arrow to the left and jumped. A being with huge black wings was floating in the air. There was no floor or anything, but it was flying in the air, looking at the man happily. </p><p class="calibre3">"Va, va, vampire~~!!"</p><p class="calibre3">The soldier hurriedly drew his bow. The female vampire spun around and repelled the arrow. It was fast. When the next arrow was placed, the vampire was right next to the soldier's face. Her breath was hot on his cheek. </p><p class="calibre3">"You, my friend, are tonight's prey"</p><p class="calibre3">She laughed and soared into the sky. </p><p class="calibre3">(Do, Don't joke!!)　</p><p class="calibre3">Shuddering, the soldier fired off two or three more arrows. But the vampire was already high up in the cloudy sky and out of range.</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">Rain clouds covered the sky. The gentle hills were smoldering in the rain. The road was very muddy. They were only one hill away from Mora village when it suddenly started to rain. Hiroto and Souichirou followed their guide, a knight and ran under a large tree. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you have an umbrella?"</p><p class="calibre3">To Souichirou's question. </p><p class="calibre3">"You feel like a king. Don't be extravagant" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight replied coldly. Inwardly, he must be wondering why he has to lead these people to the village. Hiroto looked up at the sky. It's the worst. </p><p class="calibre3">"The worst"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou grumbled. He had walked all the way from Solm. The only people who can ride horses are the knights, the steward and the castle lord. Thanks to this, Hiroto has a good understanding of the Hybride Kingdom. Until about fifty years ago, this country was a land of only humans and elves. However, the plague had drastically reduced the population of the Hybride Kingdom. In some towns, half of the population had been lost. Due to the declining population, the number of places where towns can no longer be operated has increased dramatically. It must have been the same as the towns in Europe that were attacked by the plague. There was no priest to hold a funeral. They wanted to ask the blacksmith to repair tools, but the blacksmith was dead. They wanted to hire a soldier to protect the town, but there were no men who could do it. There was no one to carry things from town to town. The declining population stopped the functioning of the towns, which they had taken for granted. It had reached a point where it was very difficult to run the community with just humans. At that time, a certain Diferente was summoned and introduced a different race recruitment system called the Ibrid system, which led the skeletons and other different races into the towns to overcome the difficulties. As the different races came to live in human towns, the town's population increased and the towns became viable. Since then, whenever there was a problem that could not be solved by the inhabitants of the kingdom, the priests and bishops of the Spirit Church began to summon the Diferente. In layman's terms, Diferente is a helper from another world. However, it seems that these days, they are more often called upon to take care of things. As a result, a lot of unreliable Diferente have been coming. Thanks to them, the reputation of the Diferente has been ruined.</p><p class="calibre3">"I´ve never met a Diferente before, but you don't look like one. You don't seem to be very useful"</p><p class="calibre3">The knight looked at them and laughed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Well, at best, it's solid. The vampires only suck blood. If you don't die by shock, you can live"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is there anyone who has survived?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"During this time, one person from Mora village was attacked" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, he talked about it a while ago.</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">It was three days ago――. A man was hurrying down the street at night. He didn't buy a torch because it would cost a lot of money. He thought he would make it in time for sunset. However, a tavern in the village he stopped at on the way was a bad idea. What was meant to be a single drink turned out to be so unexpectedly delicious that he ended up having two or three more drinks and he was completely drunk. He sobered up and went out, but he was much later than planned. He hadn't heard anything about it recently. But night is their time. Even if he doesn't run into them, they're still out there. </p><p class="calibre3">(Another half hour's walk and I should be there) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The man hurried up the hill. He reached the top of a gentle hill. The moonlight illuminated the descent. The fields were brightly lit and the road was black. Trees were scattered at intervals of a few meters in the field. If you connect the trees, you will find the road. </p><p class="calibre3">(A little more) 　</p><p class="calibre3">As he started to descend, he saw a black shadow running over the field. </p><p class="calibre3">(Bat?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The man broke into a cold sweat. It was a very big bat. </p><p class="calibre3">(No way, it's......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">A chill crept up his neck. </p><p class="calibre3">(Hiiii......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The man walked down the slope, scared. There was a strange sound in the air. But before he could ask who it was, he was knocked down by the road. He slammed his face into the ground. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's been a long time since I've had one of these"</p><p class="calibre3">It was a woman's voice that he heard. The woman's breath was on the man's neck. He couldn't scream. Before he could scream, the woman had clamped her hands around his neck. The man's eyes peeled open and he convulsed. The woman's throat rumbled. Saliva spilled from her twisted lips and the man's eyes looked up into the dark air. The man's eyes turned empty. The female vampire looked up. The man's eyes were bared and he lay motionless on the dirt. </p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, dear. You've died from the shock of being sucked. What a shame. I would have attacked you again if you were still alive" </p>

<p class="calibre3">A bloody fang peeked out from her smiling lips. Black wings with claws spread from the back of the woman who stood up.</p><p class="calibre3">4</p><p class="calibre3">"It's still about half an hour until Mora" </p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked the knight who had concluded this. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did that person die?"</p><p class="calibre3">"He almost died. A priest from the village happened to come on an errand and found him and he came back to life. But another man died a week ago. Ten days before that, two people died"</p><p class="calibre3">"Did they all have their blood sucked?"</p><p class="calibre3">The knight nodded.</p><p class="calibre3">"They're murderous. You'd better watch out, too or you'll be dead before you know it"</p><p class="calibre3">The sound of the rain intensified and became like a curtain. Then the rain slowed down again. It's not going to stop raining for a while. Vampire, Hiroto thought. How in the world does he catch one? He wondered what it would be like for something the size of a person to fly. If it attacked from the sky, that would be bad. How can he prevent it? How will he fight? Wisdom, courage and friendship? That's absolutely impossible. Suddenly, he heard the sound of puddles being popped. A white figure was approaching in the rain. Souichirou shivered, probably because he thought it was a vampire. </p><p class="calibre3">(It's not a vampire) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought. He doesn't think a vampire would go to the trouble of running in the rain. Besides, the vampire that appeared three days ago must have had black wings. </p><p class="calibre3">(Maybe a villager came to take shelter from the rain) 　</p><p class="calibre3">When Hiroto saw the figure coming towards him, he was surprised. It was a mass in dirty bandages that jumped into the air. Hiroto and Souichirou eyes lit up for a moment. </p><p class="calibre3">(Desert people?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The first thing that came to mind was the Bedouin people. He mistakenly thought that person was......wearing a turban like the Arab nomads who live in the desert. But it wasn't a desert people. Like mummies found in graveyards, it had yellowish bandages wrapped tightly around its body. Even the fingertips were carefully bandaged. The only thing that was exposed was the eyes. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hiiii! Mummy!"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou hid behind Hiroto. The mummy looked at Hiroto and the others sadly. Hiroto looked down at the mummy from head to toe. He raised his gaze again from the toes and stopped at the bust. The breasts, covered by bandages, jutted out beautifully. They were no bigger than half a grapefruit. They were hidden by the filthy bandages, but as if they had just been subjected to a violent mountain-building exercise, they curved steeply and loomed large. </p><p class="calibre3">(A girl......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The other party was a female mummy. The mummy girl was squirming, her thighs together. She looked like she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. </p><p class="calibre3">"Go away"　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight said and the mummy girl bowed her head and turned away. She also tried to run out into the heavy rain. </p><p class="calibre3">(You're going to send a girl out in the rain like this......!?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Quickly, Hiroto had stopped her. </p><p class="calibre3">"You don't have to go. You should go take shelter from the rain"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl paused. She kept her back to him and only turned her head in surprise. </p><p class="calibre3">"Come here" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto grabbed the mummy girl's hand. The bandage was moist and wet. She must have run while getting wet all the time.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey"　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight gave him an unpleasant look.</p><p class="calibre3">"You're a knight, so show some chivalry spirit♪"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto winked at him. </p><p class="calibre3">"The chivalry spirit is not for monsters"</p><p class="calibre3">"In an emergency, even lions take refuge in caves with other animals. You'll have to forgive me, think of it as celebrating my arrival at the fort" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight smiled carefree and turned around, grumbling. He submits. </p><p class="calibre3">"It'll be fine. Let's take shelter from the rain together"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto pulled the mummy girl along. When they got under the tree, the rain intensified. It was not going to stop for a while. It was a good thing he had stopped her, Hiroto thought. If he hadn't stopped her, she would have been right in the middle of a downpour. </p><p class="calibre3">"Emm......thank you very much......"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl bowed her head politely. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you live near here?"</p><p class="calibre3">"The cave over there......"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl answered in a faltering manner. It was kind of cute. Hiroto took another close look at the mummy girl. After all, the bandages that hid the bulges around her chest are big. </p><p class="calibre3">(If she were a human girl, she might be quite popular)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought. Her eyes, which he could see through the bandage, were also blue. When the bandages are removed, she must have a cute face. </p><p class="calibre3">(I wonder if she's really beautiful)</p><p class="calibre3">Probably so. Such a cute girl lives near Mora village.</p><p class="calibre3">(Thats it) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto had an idea. Hiroto didn't know anything about Mora. Ask the locals about the locals. So let's ask her. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm a Diferente. We're on our way to Mora fort" </p><p class="calibre3">"Diferente?"</p><p class="calibre3">"We've just come from another world and we need some help. Do you know anything about the vampires?"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl was silent. </p><p class="calibre3">(Is she scared?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">It was hard to read the signs of silence. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do vampires only come out at night?"</p><p class="calibre3">“It wasn't the mummies who did it"</p><p class="calibre3">In a small voice, the mummy girl answered. It was a strangely self-protective reply. </p><p class="calibre3">"It was the vampires who attacked, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">"It had nothing to do with the mummies"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl replied with a pout. It was a defensive answer again. </p><p class="calibre3">(What is she trying to defend herself against?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Thinking for a moment, Hiroto realized. It's not what she is defending against. It was what she was trying to defend. What――. In other words, her own race――. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think maybe they're starting bad rumors about the vampires?"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl didn't answer. She must not answer because it is true.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you standing up?"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl didn't answer. Silence is eloquent. The reason why she didn't answer was because there was a human knight nearby. She is worried about him. Asking more questions would only annoy the mummy girl. Hiroto changed the subject. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did you do an errand today?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"Alcohol?"</p><p class="calibre3">She shook her head. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it a celebration?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Wedding......"</p><p class="calibre3">Someone seems to be getting married. So she probably went to the next village to buy alcohol.</p><p class="calibre3">"Does it rain often here?"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl shook her head. </p><p class="calibre3">"It hasn't been raining lately"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then maybe we're lucky"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl looked at Hiroto curiously. </p><p class="calibre3">"The fact that it rarely rains is a sign of good things to come. Congratulations to the newlyweds"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl's face lit up. She shook her head. Good. They talked about the vampires and the place sank, but she got brighter. The more cheerful the mummy girl became, the happier Hiroto became. He couldn't wait to see her bright face.</p><p class="calibre3">"That bandage looks good on you"</p><p class="calibre3">When he complimented her, the mummy girl turned her head down in embarrassment. She was embarrassed. Cute. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think it would look good on a human?"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl looked at Hiroto curiously. Why the strange expression on her face? If you are injured, you have to wear a bandage. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it something that humans are not allowed to wear?"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl shook her head. </p><p class="calibre3">"But if you're not a mummy, you can't wrap it up properly......"</p><p class="calibre3">Is this the same as saying that Japanese people, who don't have the culture to wear a turban, cannot wear it well? Is that why she looked at him so strangely? Somehow, Hiroto thinks not. Suddenly, the sound of the rain had weakened. The large drops of rain turned into small ones and the lines drawn by the rain became thinner and smaller. Eventually, the line was almost invisible. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let's go"　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight jumped on his horse. Hiroto had just gotten to know a mummy, but the fun was over. The horse started to walk. Hiroto had to leave, too. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let's go" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou walked ahead of him. Hiroto felt disappointed. She was the first person he had ever had a normal conversation with in this world. He wanted to talk more. Thinking of a witty line, he quickly said </p><p class="calibre3">"See you later. Next time, wrap me up in bandages"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto waved and walked off down the muddy path. He avoided the muddy part in the middle and walked on the grass on the side. When he turned around, the mummy girl was staring at Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"What kind of nerves do you have?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou slowed down and stepped back. </p><p class="calibre3">"What?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You're dealing with a mummy"</p><p class="calibre3">"But she had cute eyes. And huge breasts♪" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"So you don't care about anything as long as it has big breasts" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's not true" </p><p class="calibre3">"Bullshit"</p><p class="calibre3">"I think that girl is absolutely cute"</p><p class="calibre3">"What's cute? I bet she's rotten under those bandages"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know. I didn't mind the exposed parts at all. I wonder if many mummies have big tits?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I can't keep up with you"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook his head.</p><p class="calibre3">5</p><p class="calibre3">White walls covered the ceiling of the small four meter high church. Because of the rain clouds, the light from the lighted windows was dark. There were eight rows of bench-like pews, divided into left and right rows. At the end of them, a tree with a trident at its tip was set up. Shining in the center of the trident was a ball of light the size of a golf ball. Hiroto and Souichirou, along with the residents of Mora Village, were praying at the Spirit Church. The knight who had brought Hiroto and Souichirou had long since left. The villagers kept mentioning the name spirit. </p>

<p class="calibre3">"Please save us from the vampires"</p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama......please help us......vampires and mummies needs to be punished......"</p><p class="calibre3">The light flickered on and off like fireflies and when it was about to fade, the villagers raised their voices and prayed further. The priest chanted something that sounded like an incantation and turned to the inhabitants. </p><p class="calibre3">"Today the Diferente have come to the fort. We must welcome them all" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers' cold eyes looked at Hiroto and Souichirou. It's an coldly atmosphere.</p><p class="calibre3">“What's wrong with you, Spirit-sama? That you would send such twigs to kill the vampires......"</p><p class="calibre3">“Spirit-sama must have been in bad condition"</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers began to whisper. </p><p class="calibre3">"It can be a curse. Maybe we're being told to repent more"</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean, repent? What is there to repent of? It's the people in the castle, isn't it? They take what they can get and don't give us any good soldiers. They're enjoying watching us get killed by the vampires" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's the mummies' fault, of course. They're so close to the village――" </p><p class="calibre3">"Ever since those filthy bastards came, nothing good has happened" </p><p class="calibre3">"Let's get them far away from here"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto and Souichirou looked at each other. The mummies don't seem to be well-liked. That's why the mummy girl repeated that it wasn't the fault of the mummies. </p><p class="calibre3">"But the feast――"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest tried to soothe with a troubled smile.</p><p class="calibre3">"You can have the party after we kill the vampires. We'll be heading for the fort soon"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto said. </p><p class="calibre3">"What good will it do for you to go there?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers spat. </p><p class="calibre3">"If we go, we won't have to feast on our precious food" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers fell silent at Hiroto's retort. When the priest asked them to leave, they turned to him and left the Spirit Church, looking like they wanted to say something. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry......but you´re the fourth one. They are also upset"　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest bowed his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is that light?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's the spirit light"</p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit light?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirits are the power of this world. In larger towns, I hear there are even bigger spirits. Even at night they are as bright as day" </p><p class="calibre3">"Aren't spirits like electricity?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou thrusts in.</p><p class="calibre3">"Spirits are the holy power that flows through this country. The spirits give us water. The water that comes out of the wells is all thanks to the spirits"　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest continued his explanation. </p><p class="calibre3">"Will the light ever go out?" </p><p class="calibre3">"......Yes"</p><p class="calibre3">After some hesitation, the priest replied. </p><p class="calibre3">"If a superior does something that is not good for the world, the spirits get angry and hide themselves”</p><p class="calibre3">"Hide?" </p><p class="calibre3">"That means the light of the spirit will go out. It hasn't happened in Solm yet, but it has happened many times in other towns" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked at the spirit light. </p><p class="calibre3">"What does this have to do with the vampire attacks?" </p><p class="calibre3">"No. Before and after the attack, the spirit lights were the same. The villagers say that the mummies must have done it"</p><p class="calibre3">"But a mummy girl said they had nothing to do with it"</p><p class="calibre3">"I think so too" </p><p class="calibre3">"Then why did the villagers――"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest took a breath. </p><p class="calibre3">"The vampires don't attack the mummies. That's why the villagers think they must be in league with the mummies”</p><p class="calibre3">6</p><p class="calibre3">There was a rift running through the thin rocky mountain. An orange light was spilling out of the rift. It was the cave of the mummies. About thirty mummies, men and women, lived in the back. They were all wearing the same kind of bandages. Only their eyes and mouths were protruding. Still, it was easy to distinguish between men and women. The ones with the ample bosom were the female mummies. The wedding ceremony had just ended. The bride and groom were nowhere to be seen. They must have moved to another cave nearby. Mimia had just told them about the Diferente she had met during the day. </p><p class="calibre3">"You made that up, didn't you?"</p><p class="calibre3">An older woman laughed and chided her. Mummies are not well-liked by humans. The mummies are frowned upon by humans, who call them dirty, tell them to stay away from them and hurl insults at them. They are never treated with kindness. </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know anyone who asks for a bandage. Maybe you're freezing in the rain and hallucinating"　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia shook her head. That person was not a hallucination. The young Diferente had grabbed her hand and pulled her under the tree. The warmth of his hand was not an illusion. It was an unexpected kindness. The knight had told her to leave. It happens all the time. She guesses he didn't want to stay in the rain with a mummy. But when she was about to go back into the rain, he stopped her. He had negotiated with the knight to let her stay under the tree during the rain. She was really happy because she had been running in the rain for a long time and was soaking wet. It was the only place she could take shelter from the rain in that area. ......In addition, he took care of her and talked to her a lot. He even complimented her on her bandages. She was embarrassed, but she was happy. Most humans think their bandages are dirty. ......Mimia envisioned Diferente. Gentle eyes, gentle face. The eyes were sharp. It wasn't the face of someone who hadn't studied. What did he do in the other world? Royalty? She doesn't know. Most of the royalty in the Hybride Kingdom are elves. The key positions in the Spirit Church are occupied by humans, but.......she is sure he's already arrived at Mora village, Mimia thought. Is he in the middle of a feast now? But the people in the village have been very uptight lately――especially against people coming from Solm Castle, so they might not be very welcoming. She hopes they don't think badly of him for extending kindness to them....... </p><p class="calibre3">"Its a bad joke that a Diferente wants to put on a bandage" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Said an older mummy woman.</p><p class="calibre3">"He's not that kind of person"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia countered in a small voice. </p><p class="calibre3">"It was a bad joke. Are you serious?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, I am. Humans don't want to wear bandages because they say they're dirty. Well, they don't know that our bandages are the best. We're strong, we don't get hurt, we don't get the plague" </p><p class="calibre3">"Well, we can't blame them, they think we're like insects. Halfwits find out who's below them and make fun of them"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia was silent. He's a kind man. He would never make fun of herself. Diferente was from a different world, so he probably saw things differently from the people of this world. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want to go to the village to check it out?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">One of them suggested mischievously. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you insane? The humans in the village think we are cooperating with the vampires"</p><p class="calibre3">"Just go and come back. Its nothing" </p><p class="calibre3">"If they find you, they'll kill you. I'm not going" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The other mummy women agreed with the voice of one of them. Eventually, the women dispersed. Mimia was left alone. The lights went out. She lay down on the bed she had made by spreading grass on the ground. But sleep didn't come to her. Her companions seemed to be asleep. She wondered if he was asleep, too. Has he been put on night watch? Maybe he's thirsty. ......Suddenly, Mimia stood up. Mimia tipped the keg into the ceramic cup. A little came out. She took the bandages with her and left the cave. She walked straight into the woods. The stars were shining brightly in the sky. Mimia began to walk briskly through the night.</p><p class="calibre3">7</p><p class="calibre3">The fort was a watchtower in name only. A stone wall stretched for dozens of meters, with a watchtower in the middle of it. That was Mora fort. It might be useful to avoid a few arrows, but in a full-scale battle, the wall would be easily breached. There were some small stones scattered near the hut. The man in charge of the fort was a middle-aged man named Luke. </p><p class="calibre3">"You guys keep a close watch. We'll be sleeping"　</p><p class="calibre3">With that, he and another soldier named Gurna went to bed. Hiroto and Souichirou went outside. There were a huge number of stars shining in the dark blue night sky. For a moment, Hiroto and Souichirou were amazed at the number of stars. And then. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do we really stand out?"</p><p class="calibre3">They looked at each other's shirts. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a good target"</p><p class="calibre3">It was Souichirou who answered. They put on their coats, which were made of animal skins. There was nothing to do but keep watch. It was a strange feeling. In the daytime, Hiroto was sitting in the clubhouse of Doushinen high school, groaning in the heat as he talked with Souichirou, but before he knew it, he was in a different world. And he is being made to keep watch at night. It's strange. And interesting. When he first traveled to Thailand in elementary school, it was like this. After a six-hour plane ride, he found himself in a world different from Japan. The signs were written in unfamiliar Thai characters and the language spoken was Thai. The temperature and ethnicity were also different. Hiroto was confused and excited. </p><p class="calibre3">(But it was probably more of a shock than when I traveled to Thailand) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Skeleton soldiers walking around the town and mummies covered in bandages. He wondered if the mummy girl had returned home yet. He wonders if the bandages have dried up yet. When he saw her for the first time, he felt sorry for the mummy girl who looked so sad when Souichirou screamed. Afterwards, Hiroto noticed that she had large breasts, but he didn't know why――. </p><p class="calibre3">(Will I get to see her at least one more time while I'm in Mora?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">They both turned their heads in the direction of the horizon when they heard the eerie sound of a beast in the distance. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is it?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou was frightened. </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't that a plane?" </p><p class="calibre3">"There's no such thing!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou snaps. Hiroto smiled. He tried to make him relax, but he got caught.</p><p class="calibre3">"We've come to a difficult place" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's your fault. Because you made that deal――"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou snarls again. </p><p class="calibre3">"But if we complete the mission, we'll get to meet the Archbishop"</p><p class="calibre3">"We won't succeed. How are we going to catch a vampire?" </p><p class="calibre3">"How do you think we're going to catch a vampire?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't know"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook his head. Both of them then fell silent. Hiroto looked up at the night sky again. He could hear the sound of someone fiddling with his smartphone next to him. </p><p class="calibre3">"After all, it doesn't connect......"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou raises a desperate voice.</p><p class="calibre3"> "Damn......why is this happening......?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou clutched his head and blurted out. He must be frustrated. He must be feeling responsible. That's why he hit Hiroto. He's been in a different world because Hiroto touched the parchment that Souichirou bought. He must think that he was the one who caused all this. Could that parchment have been a door to another world? Was it a tool to summon Diferente? Perhaps it was. That map had the word HYBRIDE written on it. It must have had a map of this country on it. As a result, the two of them are in a different world from the one they came from. And there was no way to go back. But Hiroto didn't feel despair. On the contrary, a corner of his mind whispered to him, This is a good chance. This is the beginning of a fun and adventurous experience. Thailand and Iceland are different worlds. But what could be more different than this? </p><p class="calibre3">"I wonder if my parents reported it to the police......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou murmured. </p><p class="calibre3">"If it's your parents" </p><p class="calibre3">"You're good. You're lucky, your parents are both abroad" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto's parents are staying in Iceland, where they are studying volcanoes together. They don't know about Hiroto and they're probably not worried about him. His sister――she's not worried about him either. </p><p class="calibre3">"I want to go home. I don't want to live in this world"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou spilled. </p><p class="calibre3">"I like it a lot"</p><p class="calibre3">"I hate it"</p><p class="calibre3">"But if you do well, you might meet an elf girl"</p><p class="calibre3">"It’s the punch line to die before that"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto didn't answer. Souichirou had become a black hole. No matter what words you throw at him, the gravity of negation sucks them all in. You can see the frustration and despair on his face, wondering how he got into this mess. He must be endlessly replaying the moment he bought the parchment. </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think vampires are like?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Trying to distract Souichirou, Hiroto broached the subject. </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou was nonchalant. </p><p class="calibre3">"Huge boobs" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's it again?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You can't imagine a vampire with small breasts"</p><p class="calibre3">"A man, surely"</p><p class="calibre3">"A fat creep"</p><p class="calibre3">"It can't fly" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou rushed in and laughed a little. Good. He smiled. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think vampires are popular?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto continued. </p><p class="calibre3">"A popular guy won't attack humans"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou countered. </p><p class="calibre3">"But popular guys do attack cute girls. Maybe he wears a motel suit or something"</p><p class="calibre3">"What's with the motel suit, is it a copy of a mobile suit?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou continued laughing. </p><p class="calibre3">"If it was popular, the villagers wouldn't be wary of it. It was men who were attacked, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">"So the vampire is a woman. Is she pretty?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">To Hiroto's mumbling. </p><p class="calibre3">"Of course she's ugly" </p><p class="calibre3">"Wouldn't it be more fun if she was beautiful?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugly"</p><p class="calibre3">The two fell silent again. With the gravity of denial, there was no topic to enliven. Creepy animal noises could be heard. A pair of eyes flashed in the darkness. </p><p class="calibre3">"There's something out there!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Souichirou, your phone!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou hurriedly turned on his smartphone. The light spilled out. A short, four-legged body and a pair of pointed ears emerged from the darkness. </p><p class="calibre3">"A squirrel?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Fox?"</p><p class="calibre3">The animal spied on Hiroto and Souichirou. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm glad it's not a wolf" </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you here?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's see if it bites us" </p><p class="calibre3">"It can't bite me!"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled and turned to face the night wilderness again. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm thirsty" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou murmured. Hiroto nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you know where to find water?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know"</p><p class="calibre3">The two men fell silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not sure if it's safe to drink water in this world. Isn't water dangerous for a civilization of this level?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought about what Souichirou had said. He doesn't think it's chlorinated and he doesn't think it's possible to drink sterilized water. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is the drink of this world, beer or wine?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"Well, beer, I guess. In medieval Europe, they used to drink beer instead of water. I'm sure kids drank it too"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you have any beer?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You're not seriously going to drink that? We're in high school"</p><p class="calibre3">"You want to make your debut?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Idiot"</p><p class="calibre3">He would have to be patient. Leaning back from the inside of the wall, Hiroto returned his gaze to the wilderness. He caught a glimpse of something white. </p><p class="calibre3">(......What?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Also, something white flickered in the distance. No. Something white was approaching. </p><p class="calibre3">(Ghost?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He thought for a moment. A white mass was steadily approaching in the darkness. It's not a four-legged animal. It seems to be taller than the animal. </p><p class="calibre3">(A person......?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto gasped.</p><p class="calibre3">(No way) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He is not sure what to do. It stopped. Then it started walking again. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's wrong?" </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think of that......?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou screamed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Ghost......!"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not a ghost. Maybe――"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto waved his hand. The white thing stopped and then ran at once. </p><p class="calibre3">(I'm sure it is) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He waved his hand even wider. As the figure became clearer, a smile appeared on Hiroto's face. It was as he had expected. It was the girl with the dirty bandages all over her body, the mummy girl. </p><p class="calibre3">(That child came)　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto climbed over the bulwark and walked out of the fort. He didn't notice that there was a mound and took a bad fall. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you okay......?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A voice called out to him. The bandages on her ample breasts made them look like they had been filled with apples. Hiroto knew it was the mummy girl he had spent the day in the rain with. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you live near here?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"A little....... "　</p><p class="calibre3">She replied with a sly smile. </p><p class="calibre3">『A little.......』</p><p class="calibre3">The fact that she falsely claimed to live in the vicinity didn't mean that she didn't live nearby. Hiroto wondered if she had walked a long way to get here. </p><p class="calibre3">"Have you seen a wolf?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl shook her head. </p><p class="calibre3">“Far away, in the woods. They don't come out of the woods. There used to be a forest near here, but the humans turned it into fields" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Does that mean that the wolves have moved?</p><p class="calibre3">"This......"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl was holding out a ceramic cup. </p><p class="calibre3">"Alcohol......"</p><p class="calibre3">She says in a small voice.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you sure?"　</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl nodded. She must have come all this way for this. Hiroto took the cup and put it to his lips. He poured it down and coughed. It was a strong drink. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hey! What are you doing! Don't leave me alone! Are you okay......!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou leaned out from inside the stone wall. Hiroto turned around. </p><p class="calibre3">"I got some alcohol!"</p><p class="calibre3">"What!?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want some?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I want some!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto took another sip. The back of his throat burned. But it tasted good because he was so thirsty. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'll be right back"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto took the cup to Souichirou. He said he didn't want to drink it, but he drank it all. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's our debut together, isn't it?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Gahaaa......my throat is burning......!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He's not sure what to say. Hiroto went back to the mummy girl. </p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you"</p><p class="calibre3">The mummy girl giggled again as she returned the cup. She grabbed the cup with both hands and fidgeted with her legs. Cute. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's your name?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"Mimia......" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm Hiroto" </p><p class="calibre3">"Hiroto......sama?"</p><p class="calibre3">"You don't have to say "sama". I'm very lowly right now"　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia smiled. ――Cute. Hiroto looked down and noticed that Mimia had a white object in one hand. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is that a bandage, by any chance?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia paused for a moment and nodded. Mimia nodded after a short pause, then turned her head, probing. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you sure you want to wind......?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She asked. Mimia remembered what Hiroto had said when they parted. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's impossible to wrap it around the whole body......isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled. </p><p class="calibre3">"You don't mind if you just wrap it around my face?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it okay if I wrap it around you?"</p><p class="calibre3">She asked fearfully. </p><p class="calibre3">"A beautiful woman may do it" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia smiled. Then she moved closer to Hiroto. She spread the bandage a little. The bandage was whiter than the one she was wearing. She must have picked out a beautiful one for him. Mimia approached Hiroto. Her full breasts, wrapped in bandages, loomed over him. </p><p class="calibre3">(It's huge......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The volume of her breasts is amazing when he sees them up close. If she gets closer, he can almost touch them with his face. He is a little nervous. Mimia reached for the back of Hiroto's head and started to wrap it. Each time the bandage was wrapped around the back of his head, the breasts came closer. His eyes are completely glued to her big tits. </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you do when you eat?" </p><p class="calibre3">"The usual――"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia bandages him further, unaware of Hiroto's gaze.</p><p class="calibre3">'Do vampires usually feed on human blood?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"Animals. Like wolf's blood" </p><p class="calibre3">"Wolves?" </p><p class="calibre3">"But since the humans turned the forest into a field, there were fewer wolves. I think that's why the vampires started to appear" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto tried to imagine a vampire straddling the back of a wolf and sucking its blood. No matter how he imagined it, it looked like a badly made rodeo. Eventually, Mimia pushed something into the top of his head. Mimia's breasts were now close to Hiroto's face. The distance was less than two centimeters. </p><p class="calibre3">(Very close......!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">The breasts came even closer and touched Hiroto's face. He isn't sure what to do right now.</p><p class="calibre3">(Wow, that feels good......!)</p><p class="calibre3">As he stretched his neck to taste more, Mimia pulled away from Hiroto's face. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you done?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia nodded, her cheeks relaxed. She looked somewhat happy. </p><p class="calibre3">"Have I become beautiful?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia laughs. </p><p class="calibre3">"How do you take it off?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia grabbed Hiroto's hand and led him to a slice on the top of his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"If you pull here――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia narrowed her eyes. </p><p class="calibre3">"If you wear a bandage, you won't get hurt"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"You didn't tell anyone you were coming out?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"How did you know I was on guard?" </p><p class="calibre3">"If you weren't here, I was going to leave......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She answered in a small voice. Cute. Just looking at her makes Hiroto want to give her a hug. </p><p class="calibre3">(Should I do that?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">As he was about to extend his hands, Mimia looked up. </p><p class="calibre3">(Did I get caught?)　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimir was looking in a different direction. She was looking at the horizon in the distance. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's going on?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Something's flying......" </p><p class="calibre3">"A bird?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto realized. It was impossible for a bird to fly at this hour. Hiroto grabbed Mimia's hand. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a vampire! Come here!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He pulled Mimia towards him and ran towards the hut. As he ran, he looked behind him. He saw a red light. It was approaching at a furious speed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Souichirou! It's coming!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's coming? Is there a blonde woman coming? Hihihi"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was about to fall. Souichirou had drunk a lot of alcohol and was now drunk. He was unable to fight. The sound of wings could be heard and a black mass closed in on him. Hiroto grabbed a stone and threw it. The black mass made a sharp turn. As soon as he realized it, the mass had attacked Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"Waa!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He was pushed down to the ground. A breath caught on his neck. A sharp object was pressed against his neck. He is not sure what to do. </p><p class="calibre3">"Bandage!?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The attacker shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"Why are the mummies――"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm a Diferente!"</p><p class="calibre3">The attacker jumped away. A female with black wings, about four meters long. The red suspending eyes shine. Hirot isn't sure what to do. Her face was chiseled and flamboyant. She was a beautiful woman with a nice body. Her breasts jutted out as high as Mimia's. Her ample breasts protruded from her high-legged costume. </p><p class="calibre3">"I've never heard of a human wearing a mummy bandage"</p><p class="calibre3">"Listen now" </p><p class="calibre3">"You've got to be kidding me"</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire made it look like she was going to attack Hiroto and then attacked Souichirou. Souichirou raised his face. Immediately after that, Souichirou was reversing with a dull emission. He had vomited out the contents of his stomach. </p><p class="calibre3">"Uwaa!"</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire just barely dodged the jet of gastric juice. Hiroto grabbed a stone and ran. The vampire will be the first to enter the hut. </p><p class="calibre3">"Captain Luke~!!"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto rushed into the hut late. What jumped into his eyes was Luke, who was bitten by his nape and cramped. The vampire is also jumping on the other soldier named Gruna.</p><p class="calibre3">"Get out of here!"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto threw the stone. Her wings flapped loudly. Hiroto covered his eyes. There is dust in his eyes and he can't get close to her. Souichirou has just reversed and is useless. He can't get close to the vampire. </p><p class="calibre3">(What to do?)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto scratched his head. His hand touched a piece of bandage. </p><p class="calibre3">(Yes......!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He hastily untied the bandage. Then, as he wrapped it around a stone. </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you doing?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire was turning her body. Gurna was also convulsing. Hiroto hurriedly wrapped the bandage around the stone at high speed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you trying to catch me?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire was closing in. </p><p class="calibre3">(It's too late......!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">When she fluttered her wings, a sign of a person ran right next to Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">(Who......?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He saw a pair of school pants.</p><p class="calibre3">(Man?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He could see Souichirou's profile. </p><p class="calibre3">"Gerogerogerogero......!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Once again, Souichirou was vomiting. The vampire, who was about to attack, screamed.</p><p class="calibre3">"What are you doing! It's hanging on my wings!"</p><p class="calibre3">Forgetting himself, she cleaned her wings. </p><p class="calibre3">(Now!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto finished wrapping the bandage around the stone, tied it tightly and threw it at the vampire. The bandage became entangled on the vampire's torso. </p><p class="calibre3">"You――!"　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire flapped its wings and the bandage was yanked off with such force that Hiroto danced in the air. His body separated from the ground. But he didn't let go of the bandage. </p><p class="calibre3">"Damn it......!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire fell to the ground. Hiroto jumped on her from behind. The vampire tried to flap its wings again. Hiroto ducked under the wings and held on. His hands touched the elastic mass. His fingers dug into her breasts. </p><p class="calibre3">"Where are you touching!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Be quiet!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Get off me! You mummy!" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm a Diferente!" </p><p class="calibre3">"You! You!"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto clenched her breasts madly. His ten fingers sank into the chest. His fingertips sink into a plump hemisphere.</p><p class="calibre3">"Aah, you idiot!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire floated away and Hiroto dove underneath. He pounced again with the bandage. The vampire fell to the ground. He was thrown off by the wings, but he selflessly wrapped the bandage around her. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'll catch you too"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou approached while being drunk. The vampire's consciousness shifted to Souichirou, as if she thought he was going to vomit again. In the meantime, Hiroto wrapped more bandages around her. The entire arms and wings are bound. Suddenly, the vampire had stopped resisting. Hiroto looked at the vampire. The bandages were holding the vampire in place. </p><p class="calibre3">(Gotcha......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto took a breath. It was a reversal of fortune, he had captured the female vampire, even though he had not yet mastered martial arts. The other party may have been off guard. </p><p class="calibre3">"Captain, I've got her! Captain!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto turned his head to look at Luke. There was no response. Instead, it was Mimia who came into the hut. She looks terrified. She looked at Hiroto, then at the vampire. Then she looked at Luke and Gurna. She shook her head. Luke and Gurna's mouths were half open and their eyes were frozen in midair. Both of them were dead. They had died of shock. But Souichirou, who was drunk, didn't even seem to notice that. </p><p class="calibre3">"Now we can go back to our world!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He raised his fist in the air. </p><p class="calibre3">"Damn it......let me go......! You think you can get away with this for free......!"</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire raged again. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think that you can attack humans for free!"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto also shouts back. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm hungry, so I can't help it!" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's why you kill people!" </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't kill because I want to! If I suck them, they just happen to die!" </p><p class="calibre3">"If you bite the neck, they'll die in shock!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Where do you want me to bite then?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought for a moment. </p><p class="calibre3">《Please cooperate with blood donation~》</p><p class="calibre3">The image of blood donation that he had seen many times on the street came to his mind. </p><p class="calibre3">"Wrists" </p><p class="calibre3">"What kind of idiot would let someone suck his wrist without telling him?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sure there's at least one" </p><p class="calibre3">"Then, let me suck your wrist" </p><p class="calibre3">"No. I'll hand you over to the villagers tomorrow" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The female vampire twisted her head and glared at Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"I am the daughter of the vampire chief. Do you know what happens if I die!"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is that a lie?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's true! Look at my neck!" 　</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6NPbzsw/000006.png" alt="" class="calibre6" />

<p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked at her neck. There was a pendant around her neck. It had a big red stone on it. </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't that a ruby?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou said.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rubies aren't very large crystals, you know. If it's real, it's a great treasure"</p><p class="calibre3">"What if it's fake?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's real!"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked at the female vampire. Lie or truth? </p><p class="calibre3">"If it's a lie, it's going to be a big deal" </p><p class="calibre3">"If you think I'm lying, kill me, or you'll learn the hard way" </p><p class="calibre3">"Of course it's a lie!” 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou thrusts in. </p><p class="calibre3">(Is she pretending?) </p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought. </p><p class="calibre3">It is possible that she is pretending to be the daughter of the chief to escape. But at the same time, it is possible that she is telling the truth. If Ruby is real, the possibility of her being the chief's daughter increases, but there is no way to know for sure. So, what to do now? </p><p class="calibre3">(Anyway, let's just consider the assumptions that are clear right now) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto concentrated on his thoughts. He is holding a female vampire captive. If he turned the vampire over to the villagers, they would no doubt beat her to death. On the other hand, if he let her go without a fight, they might beat him to death for letting her go. If it wasn't the chief's daughter, he might be able to turn her in to the villagers, though he didn't want to see her killed. But what if it was the chief's daughter? Hiroto doesn't think the vampire tribe would be so quiet after having her killed. It could lead to retaliation. Let's take the risk for now, Hiroto thought. If the vampire wasn't the chief's daughter, he could only admire his opponent's acting skills. The question was, what would he do now? How about making her promise not to attack the villagers? He doesn't think she'll settle for such a promise.</p><p class="calibre3">『You can't rely on the promises of vampires. Kill』 　</p><p class="calibre3">That was the most likely outcome. Then, let her go for the price of Ruby? Hiroto wondered if the villagers would be satisfied with that. If it was a real ruby, it could certainly be sold for money, but where would they go to sell it? They might be attacked by thieves on the way. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going to kill her?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia asked anxiously. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think it would be better to turn her in to the villagers?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia shook her head sideways. She, too, disagreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think, Souichirou?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Instead of answering, Souichirou vomited. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let me go!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The female vampire shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">"I can't do that.
