<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 6: Curse</h1>
<p class="calibre3">1</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia was lying down in the cave. She wondered if he might be coming back for a day trip. So she waited by the bridge for a while, but Hiroto was nowhere to be seen. She wondered if she would ever see him again. Or will she be able to see him when it rains again? If it rains, she'll have to take shelter from the rain again, and then she'll go to that tree....... She knows she is thinking silly things. She is a mummy. The world hates her. And the other person――Diferente. Fifty years ago, when half of the human population had died and the town was in ruins, the Archbishop summoned a Diferente from another world. Diferente ascended to the throne as the king of the land and issued a decree to recognize not only humans and elves, but also skeletons and mummies as the people of the land. That was the beginning of the Ibrid system, she was told. The towns regained their populations, came to life and the country was restored to normal. It was thanks to the Diferente that the mummies were able to live near the villages instead of in the desert. But it's been fifty years since then. The towns are becoming a place for humans and elves again. It seems that long ago, the mummies also lived in towns, but they were driven out for various reasons. Since they were originally a race that didn't like to fight, they had no choice but to flee when they were approached by armed knights. </p><p class="calibre3"> (Is that person a descendant of the king?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia thought. It is said that Diferente, who became the king, returned to the original world without having any children. Could he be a descendant born in another world? She doesn't know. She's heard rumors that the recently summoned Diferente are not so great. Those who were summoned to lift the curse of the spirit, ended up falling under the curse and turning into skeletons. Dead people. Thanks to this, the townspeople no longer respect Diferente as much as they used to. But for Mimia――. Mimia thought of Hiroto's face.</p><p class="calibre3">《I think she's definitely a cute girl》</p><p class="calibre3">The words she heard when they parted. </p><p class="calibre3">《Thank you》 　</p><p class="calibre3">The words of thanks that he said with squinting eyes. </p><p class="calibre3">《That bandage looks good on you》</p><p class="calibre3">It wasn't a pretty bandage by any means, but she got a compliment. It made her happy. She didn't think there was anyone who would say such a thing to her. Ah. That's right. He is not a human, he is a Diferente. </p><p class="calibre3">(I wonder if I can meet him at the castle....... But I wonder if they'll let him go out......)</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">In the middle of the night, Valkyria sneaks out of her tent. There were no torches. Even without them, vampires could see. Valkyria slipped between the tents and peered into her sister's tent. </p><p class="calibre3">"Curéle. Do you want to come with me?"</p><p class="calibre3">Inside the tent, a lump crept into motion. She shook her head. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's fun"</p><p class="calibre3">She still shook her head. It's impossible. There was no way she could get Curéle out. She gave up and left the tent. Valkyria kicked the ground lightly and flew up. As she soared higher into the night sky, flapping her wings, she saw a black shadow. </p><p class="calibre3">"I knew it"　</p><p class="calibre3">It was her father, Zeldis. </p><p class="calibre3">"You're monitoring your daughter?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Guarding" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis says and laughs.</p><p class="calibre3">"You're going to see that man, aren't you?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I think I'll catch him this time"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'd like to see his face, too"</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria chuckled and so did Zeldis. </p><p class="calibre3">"You are my daughter, after all"</p><p class="calibre3">"Whose daughter is Curéle?"</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis smiled bitterly.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll ask the spirits next time"</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">The torchlight illuminated Solm castle. As usual, they were wary of them. It's useless. No matter how many torches they burned, they couldn't light up the sky. The power of darkness is strong. The vampire father and daughter duo landed noiselessly on the second floor of the castle. As usual, a wooden door blocked the corridor. They didn't want to let themselves in. Zeldis dripped oil into the gutter. Carefully, they opened the door. They entered the castle without difficulty. It was an eerily quiet night. It was as if something ominous was about to happen. </p><p class="calibre3">"Where is he?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't this a nice room?" </p><p class="calibre3">"The steward named Senterio is notoriously stingy. It's probably the worst room" 　</p><p class="calibre3">They hurried to the attic. They opened the door. The soldiers were asleep. They peeked into the next room and the one after that. There was no sign of the man they were looking for. </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't he in this castle?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis said. </p><p class="calibre3">"He said he was going to see the Archbishop......"</p><p class="calibre3">He's already left. </p><p class="calibre3">"We're leaving"</p><p class="calibre3">Just as they were about to return, they heard a crazy scream from upstairs. Uwaa, waa, waaaaa, scream, an unusual scream.</p><p class="calibre3">"Se, Senterio-sama~~~!!"</p><p class="calibre3">A knight went through the corridor. The room he jumped out of seemed to be the castle lord's room. </p><p class="calibre3">"No way, I don't think it's here" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a joke, isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre3">The two took a peek and gasped. A woman was crying in front of them. It was a woman with a voluptuous body. She must be the castle lord's caretaker. On the other side, a man was rolling off the bed. His arms and legs were outstretched and he couldn't move a muscle. His eyes were looking up in the air, but he was not looking anywhere. He was dead. The man was Urkan, the castle lord.</p><p class="calibre3">4</p><p class="calibre3">There was a great commotion in Solm Castle. Urkan, the castle lord had suddenly died. All the people in the castle were awakened. A doctor was called. Soldiers ran to call Solm´s priest. The body was moved to the great hall. The doctor and the priest rushed in, but the doctor shook his head, saying he didn't know what had caused the death. </p><p class="calibre3">"It must be a curse"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest's words made Senterio shudder. </p><p class="calibre3">"You have done something that has angered the spirits and then you have done something you should not have done. That's why the castle lord was sacrificed" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shuddered even more. </p><p class="calibre3">"I, I have no idea......"</p><p class="calibre3">The knights were looking directly at him. </p><p class="calibre3">"What! You think it's my fault!" </p><p class="calibre3">"There is no one else"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest spoke up clearly on behalf of the knights. </p><p class="calibre3">"What!"</p><p class="calibre3">"If the Diferente were the cause of the curse, there was no need for Lord Urkan to die suddenly. The fact that he died means that it was the other way around" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio snorted.</p><p class="calibre3">"You told us to be careful"</p><p class="calibre3">"I told you to be cautious about the execution tomorrow!"</p><p class="calibre3">"If it were a simple matter of punishing someone, the curse of the spirits would not occur! It's because there are ongoing problems in our town that the curse of the spirits occurs!"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio bit his lips. He just got angry and slammed them into the dungeon, but that wasn't right....... No. This is not possible. Urkan-sama was so worried about his life that he died of worry. Senterio tried to convince himself of this, but it didn't feel right. After all, imprisonment was a bad idea. If it was going to be like this, he should have quickly prepared a carriage and sent them off to Secondaria. Postponing it for a day had brought about the worst possible outcome. The castle lord had no wife or children. Both died a few years ago. </p><p class="calibre3">(I have no choice but to act for the castle lord)　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio made up his mind. But at the same time, he realized something important. The curse of the spirits was still continuing. And the curse would fall on the castle lord. If he takes over as the castle lord, it means that he is going to die. </p><p class="calibre3">(I don't want to die......!)</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio thought. If he becomes the castle lord, every move he makes will lead to death. If he fails, the curse of the spirits will fall on him immediately as death. He can't let himself die. He has decided to bring the elves to this town. He decided that he would show back the people who mocked him. </p><p class="calibre3">(I have to get a replacement......)</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio looked at Calavera, the guard captain. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is it?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You are the castle lord" </p><p class="calibre3">"I have my duties as guard captain, sir"</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you afraid of dying?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I think it would be more natural for you to take over, sir, given your position" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights were looking at him. Run away? He is afraid to die. It looks like that.</p><p class="calibre3">(You guys will run away if you fall into the same situation!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio glared back at the knights. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's best to keep your hands to yourself in times like these, sir"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest said. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you telling me to leave without doing anything!?"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"Fortunately, we have the best person for the job"</p><p class="calibre3">5</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto and Souichirou were huddled together, asleep. It was cold. Even with their furs on, it was chilly and it hit them to the core. </p><p class="calibre3">(I'll probably be dead by morning before I'm executed)　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you awake?"</p><p class="calibre3">He asked Souichirou. </p><p class="calibre3">"Can you sleep?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it better to stay up? I'm about to freeze to death"</p><p class="calibre3">"I think so, too" </p><p class="calibre3">"Then, how about Shiritori?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Can you do that?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Breasts"</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou asked back. </p><p class="calibre3">"Shiritori, it's starting. Breasts"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do it!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">As Souichirou raised his voice, the sound of footsteps approached.</p><p class="calibre3">"No way, execution......!?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou is ready. Hiroto twisted his neck. He doesn't think he will be executed at midnight like this. However, the approaching footsteps are unusual. It was oddly hectic. </p><p class="calibre3">"If I ask them to let me squeeze tits before I die, will they do me the favor?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you stupid!"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">“Hiroto-dono! No, Hiroto-sama!"　</p><p class="calibre3">The candlelight spilled out and the knights appeared behind the iron doors. To Hiroto´s surprise, there were three of them. </p><p class="calibre3">“What? Have you come to play Shiritori?” </p><p class="calibre3">"Quick, get out here"　</p><p class="calibre3">One of them unlocks the door.</p><p class="calibre3">"Come"</p><p class="calibre3">"You're letting us go secretly?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked and the three of them shook their heads. </p><p class="calibre3">"You were nominated as the new castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">6</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was sitting in the hall on a long-backed chair. It was the castle lord's chair. Right next to him, Souichirou was seated in a short-backed chair. He had just finished listening to the whole situation. In front of them, they see Calavera, the guard captain who has become a vassal and the knights of the garrison. There are also servants and the priest. </p><p class="calibre3">“I think it would be better for the castle lord to be Souichirou-dono"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio suggested. </p><p class="calibre3">"No, I don't want to be the castle lord" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou immediately refused. </p><p class="calibre3">"I think Hiroto-sama is the best" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera said. </p><p class="calibre3">"So do we"</p><p class="calibre3">The knights agreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"I, too, think that Hiroto-sama is the best"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest agreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Then, as we originally decided, Hiroto-dono will be the new castle lord......" </p><p class="calibre3">"Please do as you wish. And please lift the curse of the spirits as soon as possible"　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights got down on their knees and greeted him. Hiroto smiled. The two men who had captured them and brought them to the castle were also Hiroto's men. </p><p class="calibre3">"Everyone, please cooperate with me" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights nodded their heads in agreement. </p><p class="calibre3">"So what about the funeral?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll take care of that"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest offered. </p><p class="calibre3">"We'll do it at the church. I want Hiroto-dono to devote himself to breaking the curse" </p><p class="calibre3">"But you will have to go out the day after tomorrow"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio checks.</p><p class="calibre3">"Where"　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's about the inspection of the school attached to the Spirit Church, which was originally supposed to be attended by Urkan-sama"</p><p class="calibre3">"Wouldn't it be better to decline this time?"</p><p class="calibre3">To Calavera's objection,</p><p class="calibre3">"No! We've had this decision made for six months! Just because the castle lord is dead doesn't mean you can't participate! They have an elf´s son in their midst!" </p><p class="calibre3">　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio was furious. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do I have to go because there is an elf child?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Some children from Solm go to school"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio quickly answered Hiroto's question. </p><p class="calibre3">"Then we should attend"</p><p class="calibre3">"If we go, we will have to stay overnight"　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera checks. Hiroto said clearly.</p><p class="calibre3">"I think it's better not to refrain. I think the children will feel sad, wondering why the lord of their town has not come. It's better to go and cheer them up. I'm sure the spirits will tolerate it"</p><p class="calibre3">"That helps a lot"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio wiped the sweat from his forehead. </p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, about the spirit curse, how long is the period?"</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean with period?"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"I mean, does the curse occur because of something that happened a year ago or because of something that happened three days ago?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's not a year ago"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest answered immediately. </p><p class="calibre3">"Generally, the curse is caused by something that happened three days ago. However, there is an accumulation of events before that. It is said that for about a year before the curse, things that should not be done accumulate and then one day the curse occurs when the person does something decisive" </p><p class="calibre3">"So it's been three days since we've been searching for the root of the curse?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto nodded.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you guys have any idea?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights looked at each other. </p><p class="calibre3">"We can't think of anything" </p><p class="calibre3">"Senterio?" </p><p class="calibre3">"All I can think of is the contract with the vampires"</p><p class="calibre3">"That should be irrelevant"</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera countered. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you saying I'm wrong?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio snaps at Calavera. Calavera also replies.</p><p class="calibre3">"Killing the daughter of the vampire chief will cause retaliation against the castle. It is only natural that he didn't kill her, considering the safety of the castle and the town"</p><p class="calibre3">"I said it was the contract. I'm doing something wrong with tying such a thing to such a murderer. That made the spirit angry. That's why he appeared in the church. At that time, the spirit hid in protest"</p><p class="calibre3">"Criticism of the castle lord?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm just giving you my honest opinion"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio blurted out. </p><p class="calibre3">"The steward is wrong"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou argued.</p><p class="calibre3">"If it's Hiroto's fault, why did Hiroto and I be imprisoned and the former castle lord died? It's irrelevant to us"</p><p class="calibre3">Several of the knights nodded in agreement. Senterio glared at him hatefully. Hiroto turned to the priest. </p><p class="calibre3">"What about the priest?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I dont know. I've heard that if you do good politics, the spirits will calm their anger and return"</p><p class="calibre3">"Good government doesn't mean that no one is killed. Do you know what politics is, my lord?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio provocatively asks Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">"Not at all"</p><p class="calibre3">"Politics is the consideration of what is good and what is bad within a larger framework. What's good for this town and what's bad for this town? Is building a bridge good or bad for this town? That's what politics is all about"</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmmm"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think signing a contract with the vampires is good politics"</p><p class="calibre3">"Be silent, Senterio-dono" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera restrained him. </p><p class="calibre3">"If the contract is as problematic as Souichirou-dono says, it is not possible for Urkan-sama to die after imprisoning Hiroto-sama and Souichirou-dono"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio fell silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"I think three days have passed since I came, but I'm sure you´ve done something in the meantime. Whenever you remember, come to my room"</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto got up from his seat. </p><p class="calibre3">“For now, let's go to bed. Thinking about things in the middle of the night only makes my brain dull. So, priest, take care of the rest. Good night" 　</p><p class="calibre3">As Hiroto entered the castle lord's room, he heard a bird flapping outside the window. </p><p class="calibre3">(Is it a bat?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought and then asked himself if he could hear the wings of a bat. Crow? Pigeon? </p><p class="calibre3">(No way――) </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you seriously going to sleep there?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou was chasing after him.</p><p class="calibre3">"Why?"</p><p class="calibre3">"The room where the last castle lord died?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sleepy" 　</p><p class="calibre3">As they talked, Hiroto quickly crawled into bed. </p><p class="calibre3">“Hey. There might be some germs lying around in there, you know?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Tell them I said thank you"</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you――"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou was speechless. Hiroto was already snoring. He was sleeping comfortably. He's always been a fast sleeper, but Souichirou never thought he'd be this careless. </p><p class="calibre3">"Have you had a good night's sleep yet?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A skeleton appeared in the candlelight and Souichirou screamed. He jumped and slammed his body against the wall.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry......I didn't mean to scare you......."</p><p class="calibre3">It was Calavera, the guard captain. In the eye socket, a green sphere squeezed out. Souichirou wondered if he was hurt.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry......."</p><p class="calibre3">He apologized involuntarily. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay. I'm used to it" </p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry......"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou apologized again.</p><p class="calibre3">"I will guide you to your room"</p><p class="calibre3">"Th, Thank you. Calavera......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera looked at Souichirou and silently turned around. Souichirou followed, two meters away. He's still a little scared. But he knows that Calavera isn't a bad person. Calavera opened the door. This was Souichirou's private bedroom. </p><p class="calibre3">"Breakfast can be brought here"</p><p class="calibre3">"No, it's better to have it with Hiroto"　</p><p class="calibre3">That's right, Calavera replied. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please do not open the window. The vampires are aiming for it" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou nodded. Calavera was about to leave,</p><p class="calibre3">"That just now was wonderful" </p><p class="calibre3">"What?" </p><p class="calibre3">"The objection that the pledge has nothing to do with it. Surely, if the pledge is relevant, the curse can be lifted by imprisoning Hiroto-sama and Souichirou-dono. Lord Urkan won't die"</p><p class="calibre3">"I......I'm not as smart as Hiroto"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou blushed unintentionally. He suddenly argued against Senterio's relentless excuse. It was not their fault and he was angry that they had been unjustly thrown in jail. But most of all, he didn't like the way Senterio had treated Hiroto. Calavera smiled at Souichirou's blush. Then his expression turned sad. </p><p class="calibre3">"Even so, Urkan-sama was frustrated with his lack of ambition. I'm sure he was very eager to get back at the people of Secondaria for making fun of him the other day" </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it really that important to you to make this town bigger?" </p><p class="calibre3">"There are gatherings among the castle lords. And I hear they make fun of us at these gatherings. I don't accompany them, so I've only heard from my subordinates. It seems that Senterio-dono has such strong feelings" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou didn't understand this feeling. It would be fine as long as he could eat and live normally. He can't help but think that. But the people here are different, aren't they? Or――is it that only the castle lord is different.......</p>
