<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5: Valkyria</h1>
<p class="calibre3">1</p><p class="calibre3">Even the ditch at the entrance to the Spirit Church had stopped drawing water. The five wells in Solm also suddenly stopped drawing water. The dyers could not work and looked up to the heavens. The bakery, too, abandoned its work in the middle of the day because they couldn't get water. The women scrambled around the town to get water for today's dinner and tomorrow's breakfast. But all the wells in the town had run dry. They rushed to the castle. There must be a well inside. Let me use it. Please do something. Rumors circulated that an old well outside the city walls was still usable, so the women ran. By the time they reached it, the queue was already over a hundred meters long.......</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">The people of Solm Castle were also in a panic. The spirit light had gone out....... The news spread throughout Solm in an instant. It flew over Solm town and into the surrounding villages. However, it was the people in the castle that panicked the most. In particular, the castle lord and the steward. </p><p class="calibre3">"Senterio, wh, what's going on?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know......I need to look into it to find out why the spirit was so angry......"</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't that it?"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan said. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is it?"</p><p class="calibre3">"The elves......" </p><p class="calibre3">"No way. As far as I can tell, no one has ever been cursed by a spirit for giving preferential treatment to elves"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then what!?"</p><p class="calibre3">"We have to find the source and punish him. When the curse of the spirit fell on Saldo town, the cause was the insolence of the guard captain. I have heard that the curse was lifted when the guard captain was thrown into the dungeon"</p><p class="calibre3">"Calavera isn't it" </p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, of course" 　</p><p class="calibre3">In response, Senterio thought it was an opportunity. It was the perfect opportunity to hit the bull's-eye. </p><p class="calibre3">"I think it's the Diferente"　</p><p class="calibre3">He said. </p><p class="calibre3">"That's absurd"　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan was surprised. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you sure the Diferente are unrelated to the spirit curse? Some of them have been cursed and turned into monsters"</p><p class="calibre3">"But......"</p><p class="calibre3">The castle lord was frightened. </p><p class="calibre3">"The target of the curse is surely me. As long as I am castle lord, the curse will fall on me"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't worry"</p><p class="calibre3">"How can I be at ease? As long as I am the castle lord, I will die from the spirit curse!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as the commotion started, Hiroto, Calavera and the priest rushed in.</p><p class="calibre3">"Priest! What should I do!"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan stood up excitedly. </p><p class="calibre3">“First of all, you must calm down" </p><p class="calibre3">"How can I calm down? I'm going to die! The spirit curse always falls on the castle lord. I will die for sure. If I don't do something, I'll die......"</p><p class="calibre3">"First, we have to find out why the spirit got angry......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest tried to calm down. 　</p><p class="calibre3">"I think because we made a deal with a vampire" </p><p class="calibre3">Senterio overtly looked at Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">"Does that make the spirit angry?"</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean by that? You've just arrived in this world and you don't know anything about it! You're doing unnecessary things and that's why the spirit is angry!"</p><p class="calibre3">"That's too far-fetched. It's too unscientific"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou argues unintentionally.</p><p class="calibre3">"What is that unscientific!?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm saying it doesn't make sense!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want to be beaten again!? First, where did you go!?" </p><p class="calibre3">"The Spirit Church"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto answers.</p><p class="calibre3">"When we were watching, the spirit light went out" </p><p class="calibre3">"Did you hear?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shouted. </p><p class="calibre3">“It happened while this man was in the Spirit Church, Urkan-sama! The root of all evil is this man named Hiroto!" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's absurd logic!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou argues. Not minding, Senterio continued.</p><p class="calibre3">"Has the spirit light ever gone out in this town before? No! Did the Diferente ever come? No! The spirit light went out when the Diferente were in the church! This man is the source of all this! If we can capture him, the spirit will come back! Arrest this person!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights looked at each other. </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you doing? Arrest him quickly!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be hasty!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest intervened. </p><p class="calibre3">"I've heard stories of people being punished in order to lift a curse, only to have the castle lord die instantly. In addition, the opponent is a Diferente. After the curse, we have to be very careful――"</p><p class="calibre3">"They were once the ones who saved our world. Now, they are the ones who cause the disaster. Throw these two in jail!"　</p>

<p class="calibre3">The knights surrounded Hiroto and Souichirou. Souichirou looks around with a pale face. </p><p class="calibre3">"I think it's hard to get rid of us"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto retorted coolly. </p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up! Get him out of here!"　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights looked at Urkan's face. Urkan lightly brushed his hand away as he told them to take them. The knights took a breath and led them away. The priest shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">“Hasty decision――. Diferente cannot bring disaster" </p><p class="calibre3">“Then how do you explain that the Diferente were present when the spirit light went out? Is it reasonable to think that it went out because they were there?" </p><p class="calibre3">"However, jail――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Urkan-sama's life is at stake. Their execution will take place tomorrow" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Saying so, Senterio smiled with a greasy smile.</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto and Souichirou were trapped in the lowest level of one of the corner towers. It was chilly and cold. The two knights who had taken them in were the ones who had first met Hiroto and Souichirou. The two knights closed the door. </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't feel bad"　</p><p class="calibre3">They said. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think it's my fault?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked and the knights smiled. </p><p class="calibre3">"You did the right thing. I talked to Captain Calavera and if you had killed that female vampire, it would be a fierce counterattack by now. Instead of a curse, the vampires would have attacked us. Even if they didn't, the castle has fought the vampires many times. Whenever they want something, they come to the castle and threaten us with 『Give us something, if you don't want us to attack humans』"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that why this castle is so cold and poor?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight laughed, apparently that was one of the reasons. </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think is the reason why the spirit light has gone out?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"If I knew that, I would have told the lord" </p><p class="calibre3">"What have the lord and steward done lately?" </p><p class="calibre3">"They just called guests"</p><p class="calibre3">"Guests?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Guests from Secondaria. They invited some influential people to introduce us to the elves. But I guess they just made fun of us" </p><p class="calibre3">"Introduce elves?" </p><p class="calibre3">"In this country, a town without elves is useless. You will be left behind from development. The elves have all the civil engineering skills and the culture. Even the castle was built by the elves and has been restored" </p><p class="calibre3">"This castle?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight nodded. This is interesting. </p><p class="calibre3">"So what did the castle lord and steward do after they were mocked?" </p><p class="calibre3">"They wrote something on a parchment, though I don't know, I didn't see the details"</p><p class="calibre3">"Does the spirit light go out because of the violation of a pledge?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Pledge?" </p><p class="calibre3">"The steward broke his vow to have us work at the castle"</p><p class="calibre3">"If that was the case, the spirit light would be out every day"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think the spirit light went out because we were in the church?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama isn't that shy" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights winked. Then the knights walked away, handing over the animal's fur just because it would be cold. The only ones left were Hiroto and Souichirou. He asked a lot of questions, so he got a little bit of information. Of course, in order to make the most of it, they had to get out of here. And so far, there was no way to escape. Hiroto doesn't feel pessimistic. He has a strange sense of security that he will be okay. </p><p class="calibre3">"They're good knights"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto turned to face Souichirou. </p><p class="calibre3">"If they were good knight, we wouldn't be locked up in a place like this" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's the castle lord's order. It can't be helped"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto wore fur. </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you going to do now?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou asked.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sleep" </p><p class="calibre3">"How can you sleep in a place like this?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You know what they say, big tits wait for no man" </p><p class="calibre3">"No way!"　</p><p class="calibre3">The two men were silent for a while. Souichirou is trapped in a black hole of denial and despair. But Hiroto is not like that. </p><p class="calibre3">(I wonder if someone can help us) 　</p><p class="calibre3">He suddenly thinks. Mimia? </p><p class="calibre3">"He seems to hate you"</p><p class="calibre3">"Senterio?"</p><p class="calibre3">When Hiroto asked him back, Souichirou nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"Does he hate the vampire race?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Didn't the Ibrid system include the vampire race? It's a system that allows different races to live in the country, right?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought about it. </p><p class="calibre3">"But since it's been fifty years since it was introduced, some people may think it's unnecessary"</p><p class="calibre3">"Senterio is one of them?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe" </p><p class="calibre3">"You've got a problem with that" </p><p class="calibre3">"Did I go too far?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Too much" </p><p class="calibre3">"But we can't go back to our original world unless I do this. Do you think he would have promised to take us to the archbishop, if they hadn't written us a letter of introduction. I'm sure he wasn't happy to know that we'll be working at the castle" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's――" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou fell silent. He was silent for a while. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are they going to execute us?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou murmured. </p><p class="calibre3">"If that's the case, isn't there a chance?" </p><p class="calibre3">"What chance?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Tomorrow the world will be different"</p><p class="calibre3">"From the world of the living to the world of the dead. Welcome to the coffee shop of the underworld" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled. It's quite ironic. But the prediction of the future is wrong. </p><p class="calibre3">"Souichirou is a pessimist" </p><p class="calibre3">"Normally, you would be pessimistic!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shouted. Hiroto laughed and answered. </p><p class="calibre3">"I think I'm usually optimistic"</p><p class="calibre3">4</p>

<p class="calibre3">Valkyria had just finished bathing. She is still angry at herself. For getting caught by that limp guy....... Bandages, of all things....... Retaliation against the mummies? No. The mummy girl shook her head sideways when asked if he should kill her. They can't retaliate. Then it's that guy? The man named Hiroto. Shall she retaliate? Go out to the castle in the middle of the night, sneak into the castle and catch Hiroto herself this time? That might be a good idea. Just as she was about to get ready, a huge man appeared in her room. He had a bearded face and bulging eyes. He was well over two meters tall. With his wings spread out, he would be over five meters tall. He was the head of the vampire race, Zeldis. He is Valkyria's father. </p><p class="calibre3">"Aren't you too careless? How could you be captured by a human?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's not a human, it's a Diferente!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She answered irritably.</p><p class="calibre3">"Who gave you such a hard time?" </p><p class="calibre3">"A guy named Hiroto"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't ask"</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course not. He just came into the world the day before yesterday" </p><p class="calibre3">"A swordsman?" </p><p class="calibre3">“There are no swordsmen among Diferente. Just an ordinary guy. He's never held a sword before"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm surprised you didn't get killed. I thought you had been handed over to the villagers――"</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria was silent as Zeldis was saying those words. Zeldis also silently hugged his daughter. Her father had been worried about her. </p><p class="calibre3">“I thought you were off playing somewhere on a whim" </p><p class="calibre3">"Idiot. Come to help sooner"</p><p class="calibre3">A few tears came to her eyes as she said this.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm glad you're okay"　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria nodded at her father's words. He's really glad she´s safe. If she had been handed over to the villagers, she would have been killed for sure. </p><p class="calibre3">"He saved your life" </p><p class="calibre3">"Diferente was a smart guy, that's all" </p><p class="calibre3">"Were you caught and thrown in jail?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria shook her head. </p><p class="calibre3">"They put me into the Spirit Church" </p><p class="calibre3">"Church?" </p><p class="calibre3">"They said they couldn't kill me there. Then they took me to the castle and made me write this" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria handed over the pledge. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's this?" </p><p class="calibre3">"A pledge not to attack the villagers of Mora"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you really think this threat will work?" </p><p class="calibre3">"He said it could be used as a weapon when asking the Archbishop for help. I'm not sure"　</p><p class="calibre3">Silently, Zeldis read the pledge. The chief of the vampire tribe can also read. </p><p class="calibre3">"You should be quiet for a while"</p><p class="calibre3">"You want me to be like my younger sister?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis laughed at his eldest daughter's objection. </p><p class="calibre3">"She's too quiet"</p><p class="calibre3">5</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire chief Zeldis left his eldest daughter's tent and vampires were waiting.</p><p class="calibre3">"Shall we go out?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">They started walking after the chief.</p><p class="calibre3">"Wait"</p><p class="calibre3">"The young lady's honor has been harmed. We must avenge her――” </p><p class="calibre3">"But her life was saved. I'm surprised the villagers of Mora agreed" </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you want to say?" </p><p class="calibre3">"He's a smart man. He threw my daughter into the church" </p><p class="calibre3">"Church?" </p><p class="calibre3">"In a church, humans can't kill. Neither can we. If you do, you're immediately cursed by the spirit. Do you understand why he put her in there?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">His men were silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"He is too clever for a newcomer to this world. It's tough" </p><p class="calibre3">"We're not going to touch Mora village?" </p><p class="calibre3">"We'll see about that. You can't make a move without knowing who you're dealing with" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis laughs scornfully.</p><p class="calibre3">"And do you really think that unmanageable person is going to keep quiet?" </p><p class="calibre3">"No way――" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis laughed. Then,</p><p class="calibre3">"How's Curele?” 　</p><p class="calibre3">He said the name of his second daughter. </p><p class="calibre3">"She also......that, staying in the tent all the time......"</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis sighed. </p><p class="calibre3">"I wish she was half as energetic as Valkyria. She's too shy and introverted for that"</p>
