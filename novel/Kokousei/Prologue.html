<p class="calibre3">Prologue: Hybrid girl </p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto Kiyokawa was in agony with the pleasure of riding on horseback. He walks through the dusty town of Solm on a brown horse. He is the first to come to another world and ride a horse in another world. Of course, riding with a girl is also――. Two tufts of beaded hair swayed from side to side of her face. A baby-faced girl with bright eyes is wrapping her hands around Hiroto's torso. The bust, wrapped in a simple linen bare top, is bulging to the point of tearing. The large chest was pressed against Hiroto's back. A rich bullet with plenty of elasticity and pleasure sticks to the back as if to show off its tension and volume, and it is deformed. The two bulges shook as the horse walked. It sways while sticking to Hiroto's back. Every time it moves up and down, the elasticity bursts. A pleasant urge ran up Hiroto's back with euphoria. He involuntarily looks up at the blue sky. As if to try Hiroto, the luscious boobs continued to explode on his back. While distorting the plump boobs, it pushes the elasticity full of youth.</p><p class="calibre3">(I have to make sure I don't look strange......)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought while fighting the pleasure on horseback. He came to the Hybride Kingdom only four days later.</p>
