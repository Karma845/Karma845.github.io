<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4: Spirit Light</h1>
<p class="calibre3">1</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio, the steward of Solm Castle and Urkan, the castle lord, have just shown their prized collection of silverware to their guests. It is no small feat to attract guests to this rural town. No elves came and the town was deserted. The surrounding fields are thin and the opposite of prosperous. Even so, Senterio had traveled to Secondaria and persuaded the bigwigs to come here, using the silverware as bait. The visitors were all prominent people from nearby towns. Bishop Evin of the Spirit Church in Secondaria. Zenith, a money changer from Secondaria. A merchant from Primaria. Neka´s steward, a town known for its wealth. Secondaria is the second largest city in Salabria. Primaria is the capital of the province of Salabria. The visitors all seemed to be impressed with the silverware. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's quite magnificent"</p><p class="calibre3">Bishop Evin expressed his impressions. The other visitors nodded. The castle lord, Urkan, seemed satisfied. He had been collecting them for this occasion. Senterio was enthusiastic about the occasion. </p><p class="calibre3">"This town will be prosperous. It has great potential. If we draw water and develop the town, it will grow. Don't you think so?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The visitors suddenly fell silent. This is not good. Senterio hurried to continue. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please use your imagination. If we put up streetlights, this city will shine like the capital"</p><p class="calibre3">A bitter smile leaked as if ridiculed.</p><p class="calibre3">"A city, but a dead city" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The money changer's sarcasm made them laugh even harder. </p><p class="calibre3">"You shouldn't think about anything disproportionate. The other day, the castle lord was cursed by a spirit and died"</p><p class="calibre3">The Primaria merchant said. </p><p class="calibre3">"He was trying to impose double taxes on the inhabitants. Didn't he die the day after he raised the tax rate?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, His Excellency Bishop. I heard that the spirit light went out and the whole town was in an uproar. However the steward was so good that he immediately restored the tax rate and the matter was settled. In fact, that steward is a distant relative of mine......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Neka's steward continued to speak. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hou" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Bishop Evin shows interest. Senterio interrupted.</p><p class="calibre3">"There is no such thing in our town. The curse of the spirits has never occurred and we are trying to make it a town where elves can live comfortably. We are also thinking of ways to favor elves....... In fact, six months ago, we issued a notice that the mummies were not allowed to live in the town's residential areas――</p><p class="calibre3">"Mummies were living there?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Primaria´s merchant frowned. </p><p class="calibre3">"No, it was a precautionary measure. Eventually, the skeletons will also――"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not a question of whether they live there or not. It's a question of the fact that there are so many of those creeps roaming around. The Ibrid system is old" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Primaria´s merchant declared. The others in the room nodded in agreement. </p><p class="calibre3">"That's right, the Ibrid system is a relic of the past" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Neka's steward also agreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let's be clear about that" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The money changer continued. </p><p class="calibre3">"I was shown something good, but I can't invest in this town. I don't think it's worth it"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan's expression stiffened. But Senterio had already factored that into his decision. He nodded as if he understood. </p><p class="calibre3">"It is not easy to understand the good qualities of our town in one visit. But a town is like a woman. At first, you may think she is not a good-looking woman and avoid her, but after a few visits, you may come to understand her capabilities and fall in love with her. I hope you'll come back another day――"</p><p class="calibre3">"There's no need for that. Half a day is enough for this town"</p><p class="calibre3">The money changer cuts off. </p><p class="calibre3">"You can tell if a woman is good or bad the first time you meet her. You don't need to visit more than once"</p><p class="calibre3">Neka's steward agreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Gentlemen, let's go home" 　</p><p class="calibre3">At the words of the money changer, everyone turned around. Both Senterio and the castle lord, Urkan, panicked. Urkan stood in front of the four of them, trying to stop them somehow. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please wait! At least introduce an elf you know――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want me to be humiliated? Half the town is full of skeletons and mummies. You want me to bring them here at night to test my mettle?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The money changer looked back coldly. </p><p class="calibre3">"I thought it would be interesting to see how desolate a town is without elves, but it's not something I'd come here to chill out. It's really not worth it"</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers of Mora had gathered in the village square. The two Diferente said that they had captured a vampire. </p><p class="calibre3">"Priest, is that true?"</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers crowded around him.</p><p class="calibre3">"It is true"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest replied. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let me see" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'll kill it!" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'll take revenge!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers exclaimed. </p><p class="calibre3">"You want to kill it in the Spirit Church?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">At the priest's words, the villagers fell silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"Why did you bring it into the church――" </p><p class="calibre3">"The castle lord ordered to bring the vampire to the castle if it was captured alive"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest explained. </p><p class="calibre3">"But――"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's the castle lord's order"</p><p class="calibre3">At these words, the villagers fell silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did you really catch it?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Someone asked fearfully. The priest nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let me see" </p><p class="calibre3">"One by one" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers looked at each other. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let's start with the village mayor"</p><p class="calibre3">The village mayor stepped forward and entered the Spirit Church. The villagers looked on. After a while, the village mayor appeared at the door. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it there! </p><p class="calibre3">"It has been caught. A vampire"</p><p class="calibre3">One more person entered, then another and another. Every time one of them came back, people gathered around them and listened.</p><p class="calibre3">"No~, there really was a vampire! It's full of ropes and bandages!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Bandages?" </p><p class="calibre3">"They caught it with a mummy bandage" </p><p class="calibre3">"Mummy bandage?” </p><p class="calibre3">"It seems that the bandage given by a mummy girl was wrapped around a stone and thrown"</p><p class="calibre3">The villagers were impressed. </p><p class="calibre3">"I thought I couldn't count on them, but they're surprisingly good. Diferente is definitely Diferente......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was watching the female vampire with Souichirou in the Spirit Church. The woman is tightly tied with a rope.</p><p class="calibre3">"Did I really cooperate?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou was constantly stroking his head. He seems to have a hangover and can't remember.</p><p class="calibre3">"You helped a lot" </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't remember at all"</p><p class="calibre3">"It was a nice vomiting"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"What are you going to do from now on?"　</p><p class="calibre3">He asked Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"I have a horse prepared at the back door. I will return to the castle soon"</p><p class="calibre3">"Can you ride a horse?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I've ridden once before"</p><p class="calibre3">"What about me?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a different world. You can ride"　</p><p class="calibre3">The door opened to reveal the priest. He bolted the door firmly.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's done"</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto greeted him with a smile. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's the first time I've told such a lie. From the castle lord――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Should we hand her over to the villagers?"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"If we kill the vampire chief's daughter they will retaliate and the town will be wiped out. We can't protect the town in the current state" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto agreed with him. So in the middle of the night, he went to the Spirit Church, woke up the priest and told him of his plan. He could not have done it without the priest. </p><p class="calibre3">"The villagers were surprisingly calm" </p><p class="calibre3">"I guess they didn't expect Hiroto-dono to catch one"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled at the priest's reply. It's a good idea to leave as soon as possible to avoid any inconvenience. </p><p class="calibre3">"Then, I'll go out soon"</p><p class="calibre3">Both Hiroto and Souichirou carried the female vampire. First the female vampire rides on a horse, then Hiroto rides on the same horse. Souichirou also rode a horse with a big surprise.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please take care of the funerals of the two deceased" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest nodded and Hiroto kicked the horse in the stomach. They quickly left the village. Souichirou also comes with a surprisingly surprised rein. His upper body rippled in time with the horse's gait. Hiroto was relieved. He was glad that his plan had worked. Last night, he and Souichirou had brought the vampire into the village spirit church. If it was in the church, they would not be able to kill her. That's what he thought. Hiroto wondered if there would be any trouble after they brought her back. There was a certain atmosphere about that steward that was not straightforward. </p><p class="calibre3">"Now the castle" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The female vampire murmured. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did the castle lord tell you to bring me back if you captured me alive?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She asked Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did he say that?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He blurted out. The female vampire twisted her head to look at Hiroto with a look of realization. </p><p class="calibre3">"You, was the castle lord's order a lie!?" </p><p class="calibre3">"If it was the castle lord's order, the villagers can't kill you without permission, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire began to laugh. It's a pleasant way of laughing that doesn't make you feel that she was being held captive.</p><p class="calibre3">"You are smart"</p><p class="calibre3">"Souichirou is smarter"</p><p class="calibre3">"Lie. You are much smarter"</p><p class="calibre3">　</p><p class="calibre3">They were silent for a while. Hiroto looked back at Mora village. The village was fading into a dull earthy color. Mimia came to his mind. It was a little sad to leave the village without saying goodbye to her. She had come to him last night――she had bandaged him up so he could capture the vampire alive. The alcohol that she had brought had also helped. If Souichirou hadn't gotten drunk and vomited, he would have had his blood sucked and wouldn't have been able to help Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">“What are you going to make me do when we get to the castle? Are you going to throw me in jail?"</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire asked.</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought I'd ask you to sign something"</p><p class="calibre3">"Sign?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Sign a pledge not to attack anyone in Mora village. The chief's daughter can at least write, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire brushed it off. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's inedible" </p><p class="calibre3">"But you can suck blood" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire laughed lightly. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you on good terms with the mummies?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Why?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The vampire pointed with his chin. There was a small bridge in front of them. A girl covered in bandages was standing by the bridge. A flower of joy bloomed in Hiroto´s head. </p><p class="calibre3">"Mimia!"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto called out and the mummy girl came running as if she had been waiting for him. A rich bulge swayed beneath her bandages. Hiroto stopped his horse and turned to face Mimia. He didn't expect her to be waiting for him. He's very happy. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia asked sadly. </p><p class="calibre3">"Yes......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">This time, Hiroto couldn't come up with a witty line. He tried hard to think of something. </p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you for yesterday. I really appreciate Mimia's――" </p><p class="calibre3">"Here......"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia held out something. She handed over a bandage. It could be the one she was wearing or it could be a new one. Hiroto grasped Mimia's hands with both hands. They were wrapped in bandages, but they were warm hands. They were not the hands of a monster.</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He squeezed a little tighter and Mimia turned her head down sadly. The way she looked down was very similar to a younger sister.</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">There was a heavy atmosphere in the castle lord's room. An atmosphere of humiliation and defeat prevailed. In the room were Urkan, the castle lord and the steward Senterio. The silverware had already been put away and put into a safe in Senterio's room. They felt empty. They wondered what the silverware was all about. </p><p class="calibre3">"I should not have called them" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan said with a sigh.</p><p class="calibre3">"I never thought I'd be ridiculed like this......"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's always like this"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio couldn't help but blurt out. </p><p class="calibre3">"Every time I went out, I was ridiculed all the time. I thought this time......"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan bit his lips, while Senterio expressed his mind.</p><p class="calibre3">"From their point of view, we're just a bunch of worms"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry, sir"</p><p class="calibre3">"I was proud of this town in my own way and I was proud to be its lord. I am neither a mere soldier nor a human. However, I never thought I'd be spoken of in such a manner......"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's really hard to be without an elf"</p><p class="calibre3">The two men were silent for a moment. </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe you're right"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan sighed.</p><p class="calibre3">"But now that we're here, we'll have to do whatever it takes to get the elves come here. You're right, we should have made a plan to favor the elves before they arrived"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not too late. It is far better to give preferential treatment than not to give it" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio spoke passionately. </p><p class="calibre3">"But will they really come?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Will the elves come if we don't give them preferential treatment?” </p><p class="calibre3">"That's what I'm told......"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan strokes his chin. He is still at a loss. </p><p class="calibre3">"Last time, Urkan-sama suffered the same problem and lost the opportunity. If you lose it again, this city will be lost forever"</p><p class="calibre3">"That is true, but......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan hesitated again. </p><p class="calibre3">"Will the inhabitants understand?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Remember when you ordered that the mummies couldn't live in the town. What did the inhabitants have to say about it?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I think I've done a little too much"</p><p class="calibre3">"Did the spirit light go out?"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"But the mummies didn't originally live in the city. You didn't have to go to the trouble of forbidding them to live in the city, did you? And if the mummies do come to live in the town, what will you do? Will the elves come? Even if you banned the residence in the first place, you couldn't convince the Secondaria people''</p><p class="calibre3">The castle lord fell silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"Urkan-sama is doing the right thing. The townpeople wont want to live with those filthy bandages"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm afraid I've done something wrong"</p><p class="calibre3">"No, not at all. A famous ancient philosopher said that there are two kinds of people: those who are slaves and those who are not. It's the same thing. Please sign this document"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio held out a piece of parchment and a pen. Urkan looked at the parchment again. In Senterio's handwriting, he had written the text. </p><p class="calibre3">One, elves may enter the city without paying a toll. </p><p class="calibre3">Two, the elves shall be given first-class land free of charge. </p><p class="calibre3">Three, the children of elves shall be able to attend school in Secondaria free of charge. </p><p class="calibre3">"If there is a flood of elves, can we do it?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You will have to worry about that when they arrive. If we don't do this, the elves will not come. It would be impossible to get an introduction from someone in Secondaria''</p><p class="calibre3">Still with an unconvinced expression on his face, Urkan picked up the pen. He dipped the tip into the ink pot and wrote his name. Senterio smiled. </p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you very much. With this, our city will be reborn. Those who humiliated us today will be bitterly disappointed later. I will publish this tomorrow" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio put the parchment away with a smile on his face. </p><p class="calibre3">"Senterio-sama!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">A knight came running in, looking flustered. </p><p class="calibre3">"Noisy"</p><p class="calibre3">"Those people――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Those people?” 　</p><p class="calibre3">When Senterio heard the news, he peeled his eyes open. He hurriedly turned to face the castle lord.</p><p class="calibre3">"Urkan-sama, it's important! The Diferente have returned with a credit――"</p><p class="calibre3">4</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio's eyes were black and white as he looked at the female vampire. The castle lord Urkan, was also surprised. This can't be real, Senterio thought. It's a dream. A dream, an illusion. No, it must be a farce. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you sure you're not dressing up as a village girl with wings?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you saying I'm an impostor!?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, no――"</p><p class="calibre3">The female vampire's sharp gaze made him flinch. He's heard rumors that the head of the vampire tribe had two daughters. Senterio is sure it's not this woman......, but he is cautious. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please bring a pledge"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto stepped in. </p><p class="calibre3">"Pledge?" </p><p class="calibre3">"A pledge that the vampire race will never attack the vicinity of Mora's village again"</p><p class="calibre3">"What's the point of making such a thing?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a guarantee for the villagers, right?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shook his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't see how you can go to all that trouble. If they break it, the castle will take action, right? You can't do that just because a village is attacked"</p><p class="calibre3">"I think it will be a good check against the vampires"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think the vampires will keep the pledge?"</p><p class="calibre3">"If they keep the pledge, there will be no problem with what they say or don't say. If the other side breaks the pledge, it may be possible to ask the archbishop for help based on the pledge"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan laughs scornfully. </p><p class="calibre3">"Surely" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The castle lord was impressed. That's not good. For now, it is important to bring the elves to them. This is not the time to get involved with vampires. </p><p class="calibre3">"However, that would mean advertising Solm as a town frequented by vampires. It will keep the elves away forever"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio put the brakes on Urkan. </p><p class="calibre3">"Elves?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto tilted his head. </p><p class="calibre3">"What about the elves?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You, be silent!"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shouted, but Hiroto didn't shut up. </p><p class="calibre3">“I guess it's a matter of use. You can't twist what you don't have. If you don't have a pledge, you can only give the impression of spoken words when you need help later. But with a pledge――if you explain that it was broken even though you have made such a pledge, the archbishop cannot overlook it, right?" </p><p class="calibre3">"He's right"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan nodded. He was right. The castle lord is sympathizing with Hiroto once again. </p><p class="calibre3">"But, Urkan-sama――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Bring me a pen and paper"</p><p class="calibre3">"I cant do it. It is ridiculous to make the vampires sign a pledge. Those murderers need to be killed" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio was about to refuse,</p><p class="calibre3">"I think if you kill the vampire chief's daughter, you'll get retaliation. That's why I brought her to the castle"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto countered. </p><p class="calibre3">(Shut up, outsider! You are a stranger, a Diferente! You should have just killed the vampire without saying a word!)</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio glared at him with all the murderous intent he could muster, but Hiroto coolly brushed it off. </p><p class="calibre3">"If she is killed in the village, they would retaliate against the villagers, but if she is killed in the castle, they would retaliate against the people in this castle, right?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You're bringing in too much!"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio raised his voice. </p><p class="calibre3">"That's right. I think it's a good card"</p><p class="calibre3">"What a good card!"</p><p class="calibre3">"If we don't hurry, the vampires will come looking for us. We can't play the card until we're surrounded. I think it'd be better to get her to sign the pledge and let her go"</p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up!"</p><p class="calibre3">To the yelling Senterio,</p><p class="calibre3">"You're right"</p><p class="calibre3">The castle lord Urkan, agreed. </p><p class="calibre3">"Bring me a pen and paper immediately"</p><p class="calibre3">"But" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's an order!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan raised his voice. When this happens, the castle lord no longer listens to what he says. Senterio reluctantly obeyed the order. In five minutes, the female vampire had written her name on the pledge. Her name seems to be Valkyria. Hiroto and Souichirou looked at each other. Valkyria is like the goddess of life and death in Hiroto's world. On the battlefield, she selects between those who live and those who die. </p><p class="calibre3">"Miss. You have signed a pledge on behalf of your vampire tribe. You know what will happen if you don't keep it"　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan said. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hmph"　</p><p class="calibre3">Valkyria turned her head away. There were three pieces of parchment. The church, the castle and the vampire tribe will keep them. </p><p class="calibre3">"Let her go"　</p><p class="calibre3">The two knights grabbed Valkyria's arms and left the hall. Hiroto also left the hall. He was curious to see if she would really be released. When he stepped out of the hall onto the stairs facing the courtyard, the knight released Valkyria. As Valkyria flapped her wings, she flew up lightly about two meters. She circled once over the courtyard and looked at Hiroto. Hiroto isn't sure if it was a reminder or a warning that she is going to kill him. Hiroto winked back and Valkyria flew off into the gray sky. </p><p class="calibre3">"She's definitely a vampire" 　</p><p class="calibre3">One of the knights said. </p><p class="calibre3">"Did you really catch her?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">They asked Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"Souichirou and I did it together"</p><p class="calibre3">"You've done well. I was sure you would die. The reward is......no, Senterio-sama is stingy, so no reward. But this will confirm the work at the castle"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto returned to the hall with the knights. In the hall, there were still the lord and steward. Souichirou stands alone helpless. Senterio saw Hiroto. He has a hostile look. </p><p class="calibre3">"Then, make the promise immediately"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto cut in. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'd like to meet with the Archbishop" </p><p class="calibre3">"Later"</p><p class="calibre3">"I need you to send a message to the Archbishop right now"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio glared at him. </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't order me! You're just my subordinate! I think I can give you instructions!" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm an impatient subordinate"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled and replied.</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't need an impatient subordinate. Fire him"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio laughs. </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be a fool. Why should we agree!?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">It was Urkan who was surprised. </p><p class="calibre3">"I have given him my word. If I can't send a messenger to the Archbishop today, I'll leave them at the castle. Besides, if we let go of the man who captured a vampire tribe――"</p><p class="calibre3">"We don't have the extra money to hire two men"</p><p class="calibre3">"But――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, Urkan-sama will you cut off your actual income to pay for the two of them?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan fell silent. Senterio's voice trailed off. </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it a good nuisance? I summoned Diferente to get rid of the vampires and it's done"</p><p class="calibre3">"That's true, but――"　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan doesn't seem to be too keen on the idea. Senterio turned to Hiroto and the others. </p><p class="calibre3">"You will be sent to Secondaria"</p><p class="calibre3">"Secondaria?"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's the second largest town in the province of Salabria. You can ask the bishop of the Spirit Church there. He'll take you to the archbishop"</p><p class="calibre3">"We're going on foot?" </p><p class="calibre3">"At least give him a horse" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan spoke from the side. Senterio's lips twisted for a moment. </p><p class="calibre3">"I will send you by horse tomorrow"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio's lips twisted for a moment as he said that.</p><p class="calibre3">5</p><p class="calibre3">On the way to the room where the knight had taken them, Hiroto and the others met a bewitching woman. It was the same woman who had been by the side of the castle lord when they first visited the castle. She was young. But she didn't look like the lord's wife. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is that the madam?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked the knight as they passed each other and he laughed out loud. </p><p class="calibre3">"She is the lord's caretaker"</p><p class="calibre3">"Caretaker?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">When you become the castle lord, a young woman is assigned to take care of your personal affairs. He said that a beautiful woman was usually chosen. Hiroto turned to look at Souichirou.</p><p class="calibre3">"If you became the castle lord, I think it will be a blonde woman" </p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou denies it. It seems that he had thought so after all. If it were Hiroto himself――Mimia came to his mind. If it were him, he would want her to be a thoughtful girl. The room was small, but there were two beds available. It was much better than Mora's fort. The knight left and Hiroto put down his bag and lay down on the bed. Finally, he was alone with Souichirou. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm so uptight, I can't sleep at all. I wonder how many hours I've been awake" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou didn't answer. He must be the same as himself.</p><p class="calibre3">"I guess we'll have to say goodbye to Solm today. I wish I could have seen Mimia again"</p><p class="calibre3">"The mummy girl is your favorite?" </p><p class="calibre3">"She's a pretty girl when she's unbandaged"</p><p class="calibre3">"The vampire was......beautiful, too......"</p><p class="calibre3">　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou's ears are turning red. He liked her. Hiroto thought about Mimia. After all, was it the last time they broke up at that bridge? He wanted to see her and talk to her some more. Maybe they had only touched each other a little. But she left a lasting impression on him. Even though he had only met her once, he remembered her from the rain and took the trouble to bring him something to drink. Thanks to her, he was able to quench his thirst. She also saw him off when he left the village after taking credit for the work. Hiroto thinks she was a very thoughtful girl. His sister was like that, too. Hiroto shook his head. The more he thinks about how much he misses her, the more he feels depressed. </p><p class="calibre3">(I should go out or something) </p><p class="calibre3">"Let's go to the church and see what's there" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto got up. </p><p class="calibre3">"See?”</p><p class="calibre3">"The Spirit Light. Let's compare it to the church in the village"</p><p class="calibre3">"How can we compare?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sure there's a spirit church in Solm, isn't there?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You're a weird guy"</p><p class="calibre3">"From long ago"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou smiled. </p><p class="calibre3">"A long time ago"</p><p class="calibre3">6</p><p class="calibre3">The castle lord went back to his room with his caretaker. He must have gone to have some fun. When he was alone, anger welled up in Senterio's chest. That nasty man. A naive man from another world. A man who thought he was going to die and have his blood sucked by the vampires anyway and now he was taking credit for it and arguing against him. What annoyed Senterio the most was that even Urkan-sama sympathized with that man. </p><p class="calibre3">(I am the steward of this castle! It's as if he's the steward of this castle!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio thought to himself that he didn't like that guy. He can't forgive him. He's a stranger and he's done nothing wrong. Senterio wishes that guy had been quietly sucked by the vampire and died....... The reason he called Diferente was because a village that pays tribute to Solm Castle complained. They said they are being attacked by vampires. Vampires usually feed on the blood of beasts. However, due to lack of food or on a whim, they sometimes suck the blood of humans. Therefore, they don't coexist with humans. Senterio couldn't afford to send castle guards to the village. First of all, he doesn't want to send knights to a village. That's why he summoned the Diferente. If it didn't work, he could just get rid of them. If all goes well, he would take the Diferente to the Archbishop and let him return to his world. </p><p class="calibre3">It wasn't until about twenty years ago that the Diferente was useful as a replacement for the castle lord. Nowadays, castle lords summon them to deal with troublesome matters. The quality of the Diferente being summoned has also declined. It is said that this is because too much reliance was placed on them and too many were summoned or because the first Diferente was too great. In the early days, relatively old Diferente were summoned, but nowadays, young Diferente are often summoned. The occasional older ones were just a disappointment. Perhaps it was just a coincidence that good Diferente were summoned in the early days. </p><p class="calibre3">At any rate, the big names that once changed this country have not appeared. They are just people in a different world, people who are no different from them. Senterio thought that Hiroto was one of them. Some of the Diferente are dead, some have turned into monsters. Hiroto, too, would be turned to dirt after one night. But......the other party was a Diferente that could do it. He captured the vampire alive and brought it back to the castle to sign a pledge with its name. Of course, it was unlikely that such a thing would make the vampires meek. It was probably to stop the villagers from getting angry. That's why the man brought the vampire to the castle and made it sign the document. He's a clever guy, Senterio thought. Indeed, the vampire was most likely the daughter of the tribe chief. </p><p class="calibre3">There was no way a normal vampire could write. What the man said was a good argument. He's probably right. That's why Senterio is so angry. Why should he be told so much by a stranger who has just arrived? Why does he have to lose in a war of words? Isn't that a nice embarrassment? He's been humiliated in front of the most powerful people in Secondaria and now he is going to be humiliated because of that stranger? That man doesn't understand anything. </p><p class="calibre3">To this world, elves are a different breed. Elves don't live in poor towns and they don't visit them. A town where elves don't go will be abandoned of prosperity. Elves are strongly connected to each other and when an elf settles in a new town, other elves donate money to the elf. The money is used to dig wells, connect elevated water systems, build high churches and bring high technology and culture to the town. The elves have building skills that the Hybridians do not have. The elves have a high level of mathematics that the Hybridians do not know and they keep it a secret. They tried to teach it once, but the level was too high for the Hybridians to understand. Senterio guesses that's the way it is. Most of the elves belong to the upper class of this world. There are many elves in the royal family. That's why he decided to ask them to introduce him to the elves. If the elves come to this town, they can change this gray world with no progress. But on the contrary, he was humiliated. And now this humiliation. It is said that Solm is a city of mummies and skeletons. If this story gets out, it will become a town of vampires and no one will want to come here. That man is a nuisance. He was cocky from the first time Senterio met him. If he leaves that guy alone, he'll become a thorn in his side. Tomorrow, he'll drive him to Secondaria and get rid of him.</p><p class="calibre3">7</p><p class="calibre3">Just outside the gates of Solm Castle, Hiroto and Souichirou came across a very shapely skeleton. It was Calavera, the captain of the garrison. </p><p class="calibre3">"Are you leaving?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He called out to them. He thought Hiroto and Souichirou were leaving the town. </p><p class="calibre3">"To see the Spirit Church" </p><p class="calibre3">"Church?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I wanted to see how big it was compared to the village"</p><p class="calibre3">"Strange man"</p><p class="calibre3">A green ball expanded horizontally in Calavera's eye socket. He smiled.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll show you around"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook his head in a hurry, but Hiroto replied. Calavera left his horse to his men and started walking first. Hiroto lined up right next to him. Souichirou follows three meters away.</p><p class="calibre3">“I'm impressed"</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera said suddenly. </p><p class="calibre3">"I didn't think you'd catch it alive"</p><p class="calibre3">'It's thanks to the mummies"</p><p class="calibre3">"The mummies?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto told him the whole story of his capture. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'd heard that their bandages were tough, but――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Why does everyone hate them?" </p><p class="calibre3">"The skeletons don't hate them"</p><p class="calibre3">"Only humans hate them?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera didn't answer. He was just about to pass a Solm human. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it true that the vampires don't attack mummies?"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's true. I've heard it's because the bandages get in the way and they can't suck the blood"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't the mummies wear normal clothes?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I've heard that they look enviously at the clothes in front of the tailors. But clothes are expensive for them"</p><p class="calibre3">Hmmm, Hiroto nodded. So was Mimia embarrassed when he complimented the bandages? </p><p class="calibre3">"You said the vampire was the chief's daughter" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Calavera changed the subject. </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think, Calavera?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I think so, too"</p><p class="calibre3">"Why?" </p><p class="calibre3">"She was writing. It's not every day you find a vampire who can write. You were right not to bring her to the villagers. If you do, they will kill her. If they killed the chief's daughter, the vampires would retaliate. On the other hand, if we let her go without doing anything, the villagers will beat her to death"</p><p class="calibre3">"It was helpful to have an expert say that. I thought so and brought her to the castle" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a pity you're leaving town tomorrow" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was glad to hear that. When they first met, Calavera was in charge of bringing Hiroto in. It was not a good first impression. But now the human――no skeleton――was expressing his regret. Calavera turned a corner. He held out his hand to the right, as if he was here. It was the Spirit Church of Solm. It was as big as a three-story building. The castle and the Spirit Church are the only two buildings in Solm that are three stories tall. At the entrance of the church, a shallow trench about ten centimeters wide was dug. Water was flowing through it. </p><p class="calibre3">(Barrier, perhaps) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto and Souichirou followed Calavera into the Spirit Church. They looked up at the ceiling. White walls covered the ten-meter high ceiling of the church. To the left and right, there were side aisles with columns and in the center, the nave spread out like an arcade. At the end of the nave, waiting in the inner sanctum, was a tall pedestal, five meters high. At the top of the five-meter high bronze pedestal was a ball of light the size of a tennis ball. The light of the church in Mora was the size of a golf ball. It was much bigger than that. The light flickered like the light of a firefly. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's like a European church"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou commented.</p><p class="calibre3">"But without the cross" </p><p class="calibre3">"Instead, there is a spirit light" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The two were impressed. But Calavera seemed to be different. </p><p class="calibre3">"That's strange" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He approached the hill with a suspicious expression. </p><p class="calibre3">"What's wrong?" </p><p class="calibre3">"They don't usually flicker like this"　</p><p class="calibre3">The people praying were also looking at the elevation anxiously. </p><p class="calibre3">"Calavera-dono"　</p><p class="calibre3">It was the priest of the Spirit Church who called out to him. </p><p class="calibre3">"How long has this been going on?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera asked.</p><p class="calibre3">"It was shining brightly in the morning, but suddenly it started to look like this――" </p><p class="calibre3">The spirit light flickered on and off like a midnight signal, glowing and then disappearing, glowing and then disappearing and so on. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's different from Mora" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked Souichirou to agree. </p><p class="calibre3">"It wasn't flickering like this, because Mora felt like it was getting brighter or a little darker"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou agreed. Calavera turned to them.</p><p class="calibre3">"Who are these people?" </p><p class="calibre3">"They are the Diferente"</p><p class="calibre3">"Speaking of which, they captured the vampire――"　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera nodded and the priest held out his hand to Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">"I am honored to meet you, sir. This is the first time in my life that I have met a Diferente"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest shook hands with Hiroto and then with Souichirou. He is a nice person who looks very kind. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry to have called you to this world. Please forgive my rudeness"</p><p class="calibre3">The priest bowed his head. Souichirou opened his mouth. He seemed to be trying to say something, but it didn't come to mind. </p><p class="calibre3">"Why the flickering?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"It's......"</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it a curse?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera's voice trailed off. </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think so. There are also Diferente and the reason why the spirits get angry is――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you saying that the spirit is not feeling well today?" </p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest shook his head and asked in reverse.</p><p class="calibre3">"What about the castle lord?" </p><p class="calibre3">"No. As far as I know――"　</p><p class="calibre3">Calavera's reply was interrupted by the voices of the townspeople who had come to pray. The speed of the flickering light had obviously slowed down. The time when the light was off was longer than the time when it was on. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama, you don't mean to disappear――"</p><p class="calibre3">"If we are guilty, please forgive us. We'll do anything!"</p><p class="calibre3">The townspeople all lay down. In the tense atmosphere, Hiroto and the rest looked around the inside of the church. In addition, the time when the light was not shining became longer. The light flickered and then went out. The spirit light would not come on for a while. When he forgot about it, the spirit light would shine and go out again. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama......!!"</p><p class="calibre3">A sorrowful voice leaked out. The spirit light intensifies a bit and then goes out in a flash. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-samaaaaa!"</p><p class="calibre3">The townspeople's voices took on an even sadder tone. As if in response to their plea, the spirit light returned. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please don't go away, Spirit" </p><p class="calibre3">"Please, let there be light in Solm――"</p><p class="calibre3">Immediately after that. When they thought that the ball of light was shining, the inside of the church became pitch black even though it was daytime. There was an uproar. The tennis ball-sized ball of light on the elevation had disappeared. The area where the spirit light had been was now a black void. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-samaaaaaaaaaaa!"</p><p class="calibre3">There was a cry of grief. </p><p class="calibre3">"Please, Please forgive me!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Look again!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama! Spirit-samaaa!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The townspeople rubbed their foreheads and shouted desperately. But the spirit light did not return. The ball of light is completely gone. The priest turned pale. Calavera is also upset. </p><p class="calibre3">"Spirit-sama is gone!"</p><p class="calibre3">"It's the curse of Spirit-sama!!　</p><p class="calibre3">The priest frantically shouted, quiet! The spirit just took a little rest! It's back soon! But no one heard the priest's voice. The church had turned into a place of lament and shouting. Dozens of townspeople ran out of the church in Solm, screaming and despairing. Mouth to mouth, they shouted, Spirit-sama is gone! the voices of the women joined in the shouting. The women who were waiting to draw water from the well were screaming. One of them held her head and screamed.</p><p class="calibre3">"Somebody, please do something! We've lost our water......!"</p>
