<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 2 Skeleton Town</h1>
<p>1</p>
<p class="calibre3">Solm was a dead city. There is a two-story building that seems to be a trading outpost, but the stone collapsed at the end of the stairs. The wooden door was still half broken. In addition, when the wind blows, dust rises immediately. Hiroto and Souichirou were walking through a remote town in the Hybride Kingdom, with their hands tied with ropes. It is on the edge of the province Salabria, a few kilometers away, beyond the town, is a place dominated by a vicious race. A knight was sandwiched between the two. At the forefront is the skeleton that helped Hiroto and Souichirou. Only women gathered in the cobblestone square. A line is formed in front of the well, and water is pumped up in order while chatting.</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it fixed yet?"</p><p class="calibre3">The knight who was walking in front of Hiroto looked at the trading outpost and blurted.</p><p class="calibre3">"I wonder if it will be fixed soon"</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway, it's a somersault. The castle lord and his steward are crazy"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto turned around his neck and looked at the square. Two skeletons cut through the plaza while talking with each other. Four men full of bandages carry big bags of wheat.</p><p class="calibre3">(Waa!? What, now!? Are they injured?)</p><p class="calibre3">For that, they are bandaged too much. Hiroto tried to take another good look, but they went into a street from the square and couldn't see them anymore. Gradually, Hiroto was catching up with the feeling that he was sent to another world. It's strange to understand the words, but he's sure it's that kind of thing. Even so, Hiroto thought that it wasn't a very developed town. The trading outpost isn't a good building to compliment. The square is also dusty. This is not the case in a wealthy town. He´s sure it's a deserted place in the Hybride Kingdom. It seems impossible to meet influential people, explain the situation and ask for help. Hiroto looked at the women at the well. They´re over thirty. Their body shapes......everyone is thin. There is no fat woman. Hiroto recalled the story that fat people are considered rich in Africa. Since the general public cannot eat enough, many people are thin. However, rich people get too much nutrition and become fat. The women looked at Hiroto's procession. Taking a glance, they continue talking. Hiroto was more surprised that they were unresponsive than they were all thin women. He is sure that for people in this world, walking skeletons is a natural story.</p><p class="calibre3">(Maybe)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was a little excited. It's a cross-cultural experience. There is no more fun stimulation than having a different base of what is taken for granted. However, Souichirou seems to be different.</p><p class="calibre3">"Humiliation....... Like this, a prisoner"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou complained. You can't handle emotions just by blurting out,</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey! Untie the rope!"</p><p class="calibre3">He yelled. The knight looked back.</p><p class="calibre3">"I can't. I'm in trouble if you escape"</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going to enslave me!?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou glares at the knight.</p><p class="calibre3">"You will become soldiers"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm a high school student!?"</p><p class="calibre3">Two knights stopped. They look at each other.</p><p class="calibre3">"What are you talking about?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Therefore they´re Diferente. They're talking in a language of a world we don't know"</p><p class="calibre3">To the two people discussing,</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be convinced there! What is a Diferente!"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shouted.</p><p class="calibre3">"What's wrong?" </p><p class="calibre3">The skeleton who was pulling the horse asked. Hiii, Souichirou screams and rushes away. There was a black cavity inside the skull. In the eye socket, you can see balls of green light, about the size of a marble.</p><p class="calibre3">"This guy seems to be disliked"</p><p class="calibre3">To the knight's answer,</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't want to be forcibly brought from another world by anyone"</p><p class="calibre3">When the skeleton turned his face, Souichirou shook. The skeleton kicked the horse lightly in the belly. The horse went forward, followed by Hiroto and Souichirou.</p><p class="calibre3">"Damn......why are you looking at us like this......"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou grumbles. Hiroto raised his face. A spire was peeking from behind the two-story building. The destination of the two was Solum Castle.</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">It was a rustic castle. A ten-meter wall and moat surround the castle, but there is little water. It doesn't seem to have rained in a while. By the way, the square was also dusty. It must be a land with little rainfall. The grounds of the castle looked like a square. There is a corner tower on the corner. A wall tower is built between the corner towers and soldiers are watching from above. Two skeletons stood in front of the drawbridge.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hi, Hiii! Skeletons again!"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou clung to Hiroto. Hiroto smiled. Souichirou being scared of the unknown hasn't changed since they were in elementary school.</p><p class="calibre3">"They won't attack you" </p><p class="calibre3">"B, But such a monster――"</p><p class="calibre3">The skeleton walked out with its back facing Hiroto and Souchirou and they crossed the drawbridge. There is a field just across the road, but the soil is dry.</p><p class="calibre3">(Dry means that it hasn't rained recently)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought.</p><p class="calibre3"> (Or maybe it's a land where there isn't much rainfall in the first place. If there is rainfall, there should be agricultural yields and since there is so much money, the trading company should be better made)</p><p class="calibre3">The image of the town was probably due to the low yield. Precipitation must not be very rich. When he passed by the large square main tower and turned to the back, he saw a rectangular residence and stables. The skeleton stopped the horse and descended to the ground. Souichirou turned to his face.</p><p class="calibre3">"Am I going to be a soldier under such a monster?"</p><p class="calibre3">Whisper.</p><p class="calibre3">"Night security is a test of courage"</p><p class="calibre3">"You're joking, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">The skeleton entered the castle and the knights behind them poked Hiroto and Souchirou. Go through the narrow entrance. The inside of the castle was dark. Sunlight illuminated a part of the wall through a small daylighting window. They went up the stairs through the exposed stone passage. It was a hall that was passed through. There are about fifty tatami mats. Beast skin was laid on the floor. There was no carpet. A tapestry was hung and a chair with a long backrest was placed in front of it. Sitting was a pale man. He has an elongated rectangular face and a pointed nose like an arrow. His lips are thin. Next to him was a fat skinhead. He looks like he has his eyes and nose written on a large, smooth stone. He wears a loose gown and laces his waist.</p><p class="calibre3">(The one with a bad complexion is the castle lord)</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto thought. The castle lord won't stand. The one sitting is probably the castle lord. Is the skinhead his subordinate? Next to the pale man was a woman with plump cheeks. Both her hips and buttocks are exuding abundance. The pale man's wife......Hiroto wonders? There is an age difference for that.</p><p class="calibre3">(Prostitute......?)</p><p class="calibre3">The two men were talking secretly.</p>

<p class="calibre3">"Rusa Castle´s lord was able to connect with an elf by giving a gift to an elf's child while he was visiting the school attached to the Spirit Church”</p><p class="calibre3">Skinhead mentions the name of a castle that Hiroto and Souichirou didn't know.</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it really effective because of that?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. After that, let's talk about elf preferential treatment――" </p><p class="calibre3">"But the best district means......"</p><p class="calibre3">The skeleton put its heels together. It reports that it brought them. The fat skinhead looks at Hiroto and Souichirou,</p><p class="calibre3">"Calavera. Where is the Diferente?"</p><p class="calibre3">"The two of them over there"</p><p class="calibre3">The skeleton replied.</p><p class="calibre3">"Such youngsters?"</p><p class="calibre3">The skinhead screamed and the man on the throne shook his head.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think they will help a little, they´re youngsters like a twig? It was useless, Senterio"</p><p class="calibre3">"Urkan-sama, let's summon once again"</p><p class="calibre3">"You want me to pay the priest? The visitors will come tomorrow, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">The man on the throne turns his pale face.</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, to Mora Fort"</p><p class="calibre3">"Will they be soldiers?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Think of them as a sacrifice――"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook by the words of the skinhead.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going to sacrifice me!?"</p><p class="calibre3">The skinhead turned his face towards Souichirou.</p><p class="calibre3">"You guys will be hired as soldiers"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't make me a soldier by your own decision! Return me to my original world!"</p><p class="calibre3">In response to Souichirou's cry, the skinhead thrust his chin toward the knight. The knight approached Souichirou and suddenly threw his fist into his belly. Souichirou crouched. Falling to his knees and vomiting saliva. Hiroto was angry. Souichirou who shouted is also bad, but it is worse to hit him. When Hiroto thought he'd say a word,</p><p class="calibre3">"They are the castle lord Urkan-sama and the steward Senterio-sama. Watch your mouth"</p><p class="calibre3">One of the knights commanded. It was exactly what Hiroto expected. The man on the throne is the castle lord and the skinhead is the steward――or rather, the number two who manages the castle's chores on behalf of the castle lord. Souichirou stood up.</p><p class="calibre3">"Damn......siege violence......"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou whispers so that no one can't hear it. Silence is gold, eloquence is silver. But there are times when you should say something. Hiroto is sure the other side treats them with contempt. Hiroto turned to the castle lord and steward.</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think it's worth hitting Souichirou"</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want to be hit too?"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio glares.</p><p class="calibre3">"The fact that you bothered to summon us from another world means that you called us as helpers, right? Even if you hit the helpers, you can't get a cooperative relationship"</p><p class="calibre3">"Who do you think is superior?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Now you´re at the top, but in the future, I will be at the top"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto smiled carefreely. Senterio's mouth opened and his chin hung loosely. He seems to have been amazed. But that is the aim. Hiroto returns to his true face,</p><p class="calibre3">"What was the purpose of calling us?"</p><p class="calibre3">He cut straight to the point. Looking at the other person's facial expression.</p><p class="calibre3">"I want you to go far away"</p><p class="calibre3">"That's not the end of the world, is it?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe it's close to the netherworld"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio smiled with a nasty smile.</p><p class="calibre3">(Is there a catch?)</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe. Hiroto replied to himself. The other side forcibly summoned them. He's sure the other party orders a crappy mission.</p><p class="calibre3">"I want you to repel the vampires"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou froze next to Hiroto. As expected, it wasn't good, but vampires are unexpected.</p><p class="calibre3">"Is Vampire a vampire?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto confirmed.</p><p class="calibre3">"Vampires often appear around here. Recently, villagers have been sucked alive and died one after another in Mora village”</p><p class="calibre3">"S, Sacrificed like that......!"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou is shaking. Senterio opens his eyes as if he was scared. Hiroto scratched his head.</p><p class="calibre3">"If I defeat them, will I get a reward?"</p><p class="calibre3">"What!?" </p><p class="calibre3">Senterio's voice jumped an octave.</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course, I'm doing a dangerous mission and I was summoned from another world for that, so I'd like to get a reward for that"</p><p class="calibre3">"Sassy guy"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio glared at Hiroto. Hiroto smiled.</p><p class="calibre3">"Can you return us to the original world?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll bring you back sooner or later"</p><p class="calibre3">"When is it?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto chases vaguely trying to deceive.</p><p class="calibre3">"If you defeat the vampires, I'll introduce you to the Archbishop"</p><p class="calibre3">"Write a letter of introduction now. If we fail in our mission, you can tear it down. If we succeed, give it immediately" </p><p class="calibre3">"If you have success"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, add the condition that if we have success, we will work at the castle"</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay to gain victory, but if you leave us in the fort, we can't return to the original world"</p><p class="calibre3">"You can't trust me?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think people who trust strangers can trust them"</p><p class="calibre3">The two glared at each other. Senterio turned to the castle lord.</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's go"</p><p class="calibre3">"Write it down"</p><p class="calibre3">"For those who work at the castle――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Add it too"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio looked at Hiroto annoyingly.</p><p class="calibre3">"What's your name"</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">As the two Diferente and the garrison soldiers left, Senterio turned to Urkan, the castle lord.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you sure?"</p><p class="calibre3">"They're dying anyway"</p><p class="calibre3">"I wish a better helper would have come......"</p><p class="calibre3">"It didn't go as planned"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio took a breath. He had many petitions from the villagers for him to get rid of the vampires. To be honest, it's noisy and unrivaled. However, the castle cannot afford to send soldiers. Therefore he summoned the Diferente, hoping that he could help even a little.</p><p class="calibre3">"One of them seems to have bones"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it that cheeky guy?"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio asked again.</p><p class="calibre3">"It will be interesting if he comes back alive"</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's not hope it"</p><p class="calibre3">"It would be impossible"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan doesn't seem to think Hiroto will really come back alive. To be honest, humans are no match for vampires on a one-on-one basis. The enemy can fly in the sky. Even if you chase after them, they can easily escape. Even if you shoot them with a bow and arrow, they will avoid you. It is so even if it is a good soldier. Diferente――especially when it comes to humans from another world. Unlike the people in this world, they have never held a sword. Confronting vampires means they´re only sacrifices.</p><p class="calibre3">"How are you preparing for tomorrow?"</p><p class="calibre3">Urkan asked.</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course, preparing meals――"</p><p class="calibre3">"It depends on tomorrow whether this town will develop. Anyway, we have to call the elves to this town"</p>
