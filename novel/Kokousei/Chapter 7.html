<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 7: Bandaged girl</h1>
<p class="calibre3">1</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio lay down on his bed in his room and took a breath. It had been a tiring day. He had been humiliated, that young man had brought a vampire to him, imprisoned him and now Urkan-sama was dead. It was a day of rage. Worst of all, he ended up in the service of that young man. He has no desire to pledge allegiance to him. </p><p class="calibre3">(If it wasn't the pledge, what was it......?) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio thought about it. </p><p class="calibre3">(The problem must be related to the vampires......)</p><p class="calibre3">As he closed his eyes, memories of his childhood came flooding back. He went to sell some freshly made cheese and when he came back, there was no sign of anyone. </p><p class="calibre3">《Mom?》 　</p><p class="calibre3">There was no reply. </p><p class="calibre3">《Dad?》 　</p><p class="calibre3">Four soles of feet were sticking out of the grass. It was his father and mother. On their necks were vampire marks. After that, he was taken in by a priest of the Spirit Church and studied hard. He learned to read and even became the steward at Solm Castle. But he has never forgotten his parents' death. There was no way he could talk to the vampires. They are nothing but killers. There was no way he was going to let a murderer write a pledge. Anyway, he has to carry out what Urkan-sama gave him.</p><p class="calibre3">"Excuse me. The caretaker has left"</p><p class="calibre3">Three knights from the garrison had entered the room. They are all hand-raised dogs. </p><p class="calibre3">"Don't let it spread in the morning"</p><p class="calibre3">The knights nodded. Because of the woman's chatter, the curse of the spirits will be transmitted throughout the town. He has to prepare a caretaker for that man as well. A good woman? That's unavoidable. He doesn't like the idea of giving a woman to that brat, but it will shut him up. </p><p class="calibre3">"Who's the new caretaker?" </p><p class="calibre3">"We're working on it. She's a pretty good woman"</p><p class="calibre3">"What's she like?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I've seen her before in a bar, she's got big breasts and that side of her――" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knight smiles indecently.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's good. You can give such a woman to that young man. Thereupon he will listen to anything"　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights nodded. </p><p class="calibre3">"And put this up tomorrow"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio handed them a parchment signed by the former castle lord, Urkan. The knights received the parchment and their faces changed. </p><p class="calibre3">"This is――" </p><p class="calibre3">"No surprise there. It is the wish of our town"</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights fell silent. </p><p class="calibre3">"What do you want to say?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't now a bad time?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You're a knight and you're telling me what to do? This is the decision of Urkan-sama" </p><p class="calibre3">"The current castle lord knows this――"</p><p class="calibre3">"He doesn't need to know"</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't it bad? If the spirit's curse should fall upon him――" </p><p class="calibre3">"The young man will die. It's no big deal"</p><p class="calibre3">"But to drive the inhabitants out of the prime location for elf preferential treatment――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Tell them it's to lift the curse" </p><p class="calibre3">"Can't we wait a little longer? I heard that Rusa´s castle lord gave a gift to an elf child when he visited the school affiliated with the Spirit Church and established a connection with the elves. Wouldn't it be easier if you let the new castle lord do the same thing――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course, I will make him do that. But that alone is not enough. The whole town needs to make preparations to welcome the elves" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights finally all fell silent. It's impossible to expect these people to understand as much as he does, Senterio thought. That humiliation. That frustration. It may be impossible to ask them to understand that. Only those in a higher position can understand the way of thinking of those in a higher position. </p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway, put it up. It is also the will of the late Urkan-sama"</p><p class="calibre3">The knights nodded and left the room. Senterio put the parchment in a drawer. He thought about putting it in the safe, but decided that no one would be stupid enough to come back for it. After lying down for a while, Senterio took the candlestick and left the room. He'll have to work without sleep tonight. One more step.</p><p class="calibre3">2</p><p class="calibre3">As Senterio left, the window of the room opened. The one who entered was Valkyria, a stunning bombshell with black wings folded behind her back. She opened the drawer. What she wanted was the pledge. She knows that they made three copies. If two of them, one for the castle and one for the church, are lost, the pledge will be invalid. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is this it?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She pulled out a piece of parchment. She read the words in the darkness. Vampires don't need lights. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is this?"</p><p class="calibre3">She raised her voice. </p><p class="calibre3">"Valkyria, let's go"</p><p class="calibre3">Her father called from outside. She closed the drawer, grabbed the parchment and stepped outside. </p><p class="calibre3">"I was surprised to see the castle lord die"</p><p class="calibre3">Her father said. </p><p class="calibre3">"And now the man who captured you is the castle lord. Which makes things difficult"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll do it again. I'm somebody's daughter" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Zeldis smiled.</p><p class="calibre3">3</p><p class="calibre3">The next morning, the women of Solm were gathered at the well on the outskirts of town. As usual, the wells in the town were not producing any water. As a result, they had to leave Solm and wait in line for the well on the outskirts of town. It was a lot of hard work.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's a real problem. We'll never be able to live with ourselves if we have to go back and forth to this place again and again"</p><p class="calibre3">The women grumbled to each other. </p><p class="calibre3">"Is it the curse of the spirits?" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's like a curse"</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that so?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I heard that the castle lord died last night at midnight"　</p><p class="calibre3">The women were in an uproar. </p><p class="calibre3">"I heard that the caretaker came home crying. She said he was fine all night and then suddenly died"</p><p class="calibre3">"Wasn't she in the middle of that?" </p><p class="calibre3">"She was just about to take off her clothes and go to bed when he suddenly started suffering and died. I heard that the whole castle woke up in the middle of the night and there was a big commotion"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, who is the new castle lord? Is it Senterio?"</p><p class="calibre3">"That is――"</p><p class="calibre3">The women were about to speak when they fell silent. A big-breasted girl covered in bandages was about to approach them. They let her pass. As they passed by. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is this mummy doing here at this hour?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">They tilted their heads.</p><p class="calibre3">4</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was having breakfast with Souichirou in his room. Barley soup and black bread. And freshly squeezed milk. Fortunately, the well in the castle was still producing water. However, the wells in the town have run dry and there is a huge line of people waiting at the well on the outskirts of town. Souichirou told Hiroto what he had heard from Calavera yesterday. It seems that Senterio, Urkan and the others were very excited about the elves. He's heard that they called people from the town of Secondaria who embarrassed them quite a bit. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sure they're just living off of vanity"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou cut him off. </p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe inviting the elves is like inviting high infrastructure technology" </p><p class="calibre3">"The technology seems to be monopolized by the elves, but I'm not sure I want to call them"</p><p class="calibre3">"But don't you want to meet an elf girl?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Not really"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou feigns ignorance.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'd like to meet an elf, too. You'll meet one in Secondaria" 　</p><p class="calibre3">There was a voice at the door. Senterio had entered the room. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry to interrupt your meal. As for your schedule for today, you will be inspecting the town"</p><p class="calibre3">"Inspection?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I think you should show the townspeople that you are the new castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">"I see"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, I have a consultation about the caretaker――"</p><p class="calibre3">"Caretaker?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked back. </p><p class="calibre3">"When you are the castle lord, you need a woman to take care of you. In this country, it is customary for the castle lord to have a young lady to look after him"</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou stepped forward. He looked like he was in an enviable situation. He had that kind of look on his face. </p><p class="calibre3">"And me? I'm also a Diferente"</p><p class="calibre3">"Only the castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio coldly replied.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll choose a beautiful woman for you"</p><p class="calibre3">Beautiful woman――it was an unpleasant nuance. Hiroto is curious. Will Senterio really choose the woman, even though it's Hiroto´s caretaker? The relationship between the two is by no means good so far. Is it okay to let such a person choose a woman to take care of him?</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, that's fine. I have a clue"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto restrained.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you know?"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio's face showed his dismay. </p><p class="calibre3">"What kind of woman?" </p><p class="calibre3">"What kind of woman?" </p><p class="calibre3">"No way, a vampire――"</p><p class="calibre3">A soldier called out from behind Senterio's confused face.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm here to report! There is a woman here who claims to be an acquaintance of Hiroto-sama――"</p><p class="calibre3">5</p><p class="calibre3">A girl covered in bandages had appeared at the gates of Solm Castle. To be honest, the bandages she was wearing were not very pretty. It is Mimia. She had come to the castle with special permission. Has the Diferente already left the city? Was he gone? There was a great commotion in front of the castle. They said that the spirit light had gone out. They might blame the mummies again. She thought about leaving, but she still wanted to see Hiroto. When she fearfully told the soldier Hiroto's name, she became quite flustered. They seemed to have muttered some unfamiliar words. She wondered what was going on. She's heard that castles often don't take immediate action. Would she have to wait until evening? Suddenly, a soldier came back. </p><p class="calibre3">"Come in"</p><p class="calibre3">Thank God! She can see Hiroto! </p><p class="calibre3">"E, Emm......is he here?"</p><p class="calibre3">She asked, fidgeting. </p><p class="calibre3">"How do you know him?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Mora......" </p><p class="calibre3">"Mora? Are you the master of bandages?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Bandage? Is it the bandage she is wearing? For the first time in her life, Mimia walked through the gates of Solm Castle. Everything she saw was so unusual that she couldn't help but pause. A human soldier led her through the dimly lit corridors of the castle and on the way she passed a servant girl. That servant girl looked at her as if she was a foreign object. It was probably because she was a mummy. Mimia looked at her bandages. Anyone would look at her strangely if she was dressed like this. If she had a lot of money, she would like to wear proper clothes. But the mummies had no money. So they have no choice but to wrap themselves up in homemade bandages. Bandages are certainly convenient. They keep you from getting hurt and they keep you from getting sick. With a bandage, everything is taken care of. But because they look dirty, they are shunned by everyone. ......She walked up the narrow spiral staircase and out into the hallway. Entering the hall.</p><p class="calibre3">"I've brought her here"</p><p class="calibre3">The soldier said. She wonders where Hiroto is. Would she be able to see him here? </p><p class="calibre3">"Castle lord"</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia turned her head. Her mind went blank. The one sitting on the castle lord's throne was Hiroto.</p><p class="calibre3">6</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto's eyes lit up at the sight of his acquaintance entering the hall. A girl covered in bandages. Her breasts protruding from her chest. Just as they had said his name, he realized it was Mimia. She had come all this way to meet him.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hiroto-sama......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia opened her mouth with a smile. It's also cute to see her surprised face. </p><p class="calibre3">"I never thought you would come" </p><p class="calibre3">"I, thought......I could meet you when I came to the castle......then the spirit light......”</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia said in a faltering tone. Her breasts are so voluptuous that she can't explain it well. Hiroto was also looking at her breasts. They meet again, as Hiroto was wondering if they could meet again. Both times, Mimia came to see Hiroto. There must be a connection with this girl. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm really glad you came"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto looked at her kindly. His joy overlaps and gets crowded. </p><p class="calibre3">"No way, it's this girl you were thinking of"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio restraints from the side.</p><p class="calibre3">"If so, what would you do?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not joking! Taking a mummy as a caretaker......are you going to make Solm a laughingstock!"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio shouted loudly. Hiroto mysteriously turned to Senterio. </p><p class="calibre3">"Why?"</p><p class="calibre3">"What are you going to do when you meet with the other castle lords and the parliamentary officials? If you show a mummy at such a time, the reputation of the town will be ruined!"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know, maybe they'll think it's a great castle"</p><p class="calibre3">To the feign ignorance voice,</p><p class="calibre3">"They'll be insulted!"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio raised his voice. </p><p class="calibre3">"There are no elves in this town! There have never been any elves in this town! You may not know it yet because you are new to this world, but no elves means no development in this world forever!" </p><p class="calibre3">"I heard that story from a knight"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then you should forget about it immediately!" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio approached Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"If you take care of the mummies, the curse will fall on you this time!"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think so"</p><p class="calibre3">"How can you be so sure?" </p><p class="calibre3">“Thanks to Mimia, I was able to capture the vampire chief's daughter. It's kind of a badge of honor to be a caretaker, isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre3">"If you want a caretaker, I can find you a good human woman"</p><p class="calibre3">"No thanks" </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you really want to put such an ugly mummy in the castle?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugly is rude. I think she's cute"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio glared at Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"You mean you will not withdraw?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Of course" </p><p class="calibre3">"It's a pity. It is impossible for a mummy to be a caretaker. The previous castle lord, Urkan, had ordered that the mummies couldn't live in Solm. It would be a violation of the law"</p><p class="calibre3">"Then I revoke the former lord's order" </p><p class="calibre3">"What!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Didn't the Ibrid system allow different races to live in the country?" </p><p class="calibre3">"That was fifty years ago"</p><p class="calibre3">"Respect the Ibrid system"</p><p class="calibre3">"If the mummies live in this town, it will look even more ridiculous! They'll say we're a city of monsters!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Have the Mummies ever lived in a town before?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Not now, but if they do in the future, this town will be finished!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Why are you so scared of different races?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">At Hiroto's prodding, Senterio was silent for a moment, his mouth hanging open. He is not sure what to say, but he is going to try to say something back. In a head-on debate, Senterio seems unlikely to be convinced. Then, does he attack from the back? Hiroto's voice trailed off. </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm going to buy Mimia some human clothes. I think she'd look pretty cute in proper clothes. Want to bet?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not going to bet on it"</p><p class="calibre3">"If she's not cute, I'll go with the human girl Senterio recommended"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio's eyes widened. </p><p class="calibre3">"Sure" </p><p class="calibre3">"You'll have to pay her well"</p><p class="calibre3">"I can't pay a mummy" </p><p class="calibre3">"You don't want to be embarrassed when they come to visit, do you?"</p><p class="calibre3"> 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio snorted. In the end, he decided to compromise. Senterio walked out of the hall in a big hurry and returned with a gold coin in his hand. </p><p class="calibre3">"Go buy some clothes with this"</p><p class="calibre3">He held it out to Mimia.</p><p class="calibre3">7</p><p class="calibre3">(That young man. He thinks he's the castle lord)</p><p class="calibre3">As he retired to his room, Senterio stared into space. He was going to have a woman under his control as his caretaker and Hiroto was going to do whatever he wanted, but he chose a mummy girl of all people......! If there was a visitor from Secondaria like a few days ago and a mummy appeared to serve customers, the town would be finished. It's obvious that people will ask if Solm is a town of monsters. The town's low reputation would fall to the bottom of the earth. Even human travelers might say that they don't want to go to Solm. </p><p class="calibre3">(That man is going to destroy this town!) 　</p><p class="calibre3">If only he had a woman ready......Senterio thought. If he had had a woman ready this morning, he would have unilaterally pushed her to be his caretaker and that would have been the end of it. And yet――. He doesn't know how many times he felt frustrated every time he went to Secondaria or Primaria.</p><p class="calibre3">《Whose castle's retainer are you from?》</p><p class="calibre3">《Solm, sir》 </p><p class="calibre3">《Solm? Are there any elves?》 </p><p class="calibre3">《No》 </p><p class="calibre3">《Ah. In other words, does that mean you're second-rate》 　</p><p class="calibre3">That's what a rich-looking man said to him once. </p><p class="calibre3">《Mummies and skeletons? You still adhere to the Ibrid system, don't you? You're quite a rare and classical person》 　</p><p class="calibre3">That's how he's been treated sarcastically. </p><p class="calibre3">《That's right. The other day, I asked the elves if they knew of a town called Solm. They replied that they had never heard of such a town. They've never even been there. It's an unexplored region of the Hybride Kingdom. Is it a good place for adventurers?》</p><p class="calibre3">A blatant mockery. Every time Senterio went outside, he was mocked. If he accepts a mummy girl as a caretaker, he will be mocked even more. It's an example of the Ibrid system. As expected of a town of skeletons and mummies. Senterio himself has never had a proper conversation with an elf. He once tried to talk to an elf as he was getting off a carriage in the town of Secondaria, but he was knocked away by a strong knight. There is nothing more frustrating than serving as a steward in a castle full of different races. To go out is to go to be ridiculed. </p><p class="calibre3">(You don't even know that, you stranger......!)</p><p class="calibre3">As he was gnashing his teeth, the three loyal knights were showing themselves. </p><p class="calibre3">"What is it? What do you want?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">The knights opened the way. A woman, about twenty years old, bowed politely. Senterio was dazzled. The waist was incredibly thin. The crimson dress clung perfectly to her body, revealing her body lines. The bust and hips protrude elegantly. </p><p class="calibre3">"She's a good woman"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio moved closer and took a closer look at the woman. </p><p class="calibre3">"If I had gotten this woman two days earlier, the fools in Secondaria would not have made fun of me. If I'd let them have her, they might have been a little more inclined to help fund the project"</p><p class="calibre3">A look of regret appeared on his face. </p><p class="calibre3">"Will the people of Secondaria ever come back?" </p><p class="calibre3">"No, they will not. They have made a mockery of Solm. It's all the skeletons and mummies' fault"</p><p class="calibre3">The soldiers didnt answer. </p><p class="calibre3">"But she is a good woman. It would be a shame to give her to that man. Let's have a taste"</p><p class="calibre3">The knight's cold eyes reacted.</p><p class="calibre3">"I was joking. That's how good she is"　</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, Senterio left the room. </p><p class="calibre3">"This woman would make that man drool. Woman" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio called out. </p><p class="calibre3">"When you become the caretaker, use your body to water down the lord's body. Then you will report back to me one by one"</p><p class="calibre3">The woman smiled euphemistically.</p><p class="calibre3">8</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou ate his lunch of bread and soup in Hiroto's room. It wasn't that good. He wondered when the inspection of the town would be. Would he follow suit? Hiroto seemed to be looking forward to the inspection. He was a strange guy, even though the place was crawling with skeletons and mummies. He had always been an odd one. He was the only one who had a different tempo from his peers. It seems that he was once bullied for this, but the bullying soon ended because his tempo was off. Souichirou supposes that's true. On top of that, he can never beat Hiroto in speech. When it comes to academics, Hiroto has a winning streak, but in other areas, he loses all the time. It was the same when he was in the fourth grade. There was a tendency in the school that Souichirou attended that the smartest kids would be on the class council. Naturally, he thought that the brightest kid in the class, Souichirou, would be appointed, but Hiroto ran for the position. Not wanting to be outdone, Souichirou also ran for the position. The two of them gave a speech about what they wanted to do with the class and then decided to vote. In that speech, Souichirou was completely defeated. Only a few votes went to him. Since then, Souichirou has stubbornly refused to be a member of the class council.</p><p class="calibre3">"You've gone too far"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou said. </p><p class="calibre3">"What?"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"You could have at least gone with the girl they recommended" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou blamed him softly. </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think he would have chosen a normal woman?" </p><p class="calibre3">"You think he'll pick an ugly girl?" </p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sure Senterio hates me. He thinks I'm a bad influence on this town" </p><p class="calibre3">"So?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Doesn't he think about using a woman to get me to do his bidding?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think you'll have a fight with the steward and roll in the right direction?"</p><p class="calibre3">"So you'd rather do as you're told?" </p><p class="calibre3">"What's best for you is what's best for me"</p><p class="calibre3">"Or what's best for big tits is what's best for big tits" </p><p class="calibre3">"What!"</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto put on a cool face and sipped his soup. </p><p class="calibre3">"What would you do if you were assassinated?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Did you have that hand?"　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto was frankly impressed. </p><p class="calibre3">"You're going to be killed!" </p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you at that time"</p><p class="calibre3">"Dont talk"　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou shook his head. It's as if Hiroto doesn't believe he's going to die. Does he think it's like a game and he can start over? Or does he have a big heart? When he was in junior high school, Souichirou was scared of delinquents. Even passing them in the hallway made him inwardly scared. However, Hiroto was undaunted and talked to them normally. </p><p class="calibre3">《Is it possible to tell at a glance if someone is a strong fighter?》 　</p><p class="calibre3">He remembered Hiroto asking a delinquent such a question with great curiosity. The delinquent was more surprised to hear the question. For Hiroto, are the different races like the delinquents? </p><p class="calibre3">"You're coming to the inspection too, right?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm――"</p><p class="calibre3">As he was about to refuse, Senterio had appeared in the room. </p><p class="calibre3">"Come here" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto whistled lightly at the busty woman who appeared from the shadows. Souichirou couldn't help but drop his spoon. </p><p class="calibre3">"I've prepared this woman for you, your caretaker"</p><p class="calibre3">"Didn't I say after seeing Mimia?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't she a good woman?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Will Senterio get married?"</p><p class="calibre3">"No way. She belongs to Hiroto-sama. You are free to use her as you wish" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio put his face close to Hiroto's ear. </p><p class="calibre3">"She will serve you day and night. Of course, even in bed. Whatever you do is at your disposal, Hiroto-sama"</p><p class="calibre3">"Free to do whatever I want?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">He asked loudly, which made Senterio panics. </p><p class="calibre3">"You are free to do whatever you want" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She whispered. </p><p class="calibre3">"You're not trying to ensnare me?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ha?" </p><p class="calibre3">"Or maybe you're trying to get her to eavesdrop on a conversation between me and Souichirou and let her report it to you"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know what you're talking about"</p><p class="calibre3">"A spy?" </p><p class="calibre3">"That's a ridiculous accusation. What kind of accusation is that, when a man is trying to get a beautiful woman to be your caretaker?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio pretended to be angry. </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think it's kind to not listen to the castle lord's orders"</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be a mummy. You'll regret it"</p><p class="calibre3">"I've never regretted anything" </p><p class="calibre3">"Then it'll be the first time to regret it"　</p><p class="calibre3">There was another noise at the door. A soldier appears. He had a slightly strange look.</p><p class="calibre3">"Emm......I brought a woman who calls herself a mummy......"</p><p class="calibre3">It was a strange way of saying it.</p><p class="calibre3">"There you are" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio left the room. He heard a strange voice. </p><p class="calibre3">"R, Really this?"</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio's confused voice could be heard. Souichirou looked at Hiroto. </p><p class="calibre3">"Hey......no way, she didn't turn into some kind of monster, did she?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think that's the case"</p><p class="calibre3">The two looked back. The girl who appeared was a baby-faced girl with big eyes. She had huge breasts. Her breasts were so voluminous that they looked as if they would shake when she ran around at the field day. Two tufts of hair tied with beads adorned the left and right sides of her face. Her hair was blonde. It was the blonde hair that Souichirou loves. Underneath the bandages, she was hiding this beautiful blonde. A simple linen bare top was embroidered with red and blue threads. Her breasts rose as high, if not higher, than when she was wearing the bandages. Her thigh-length skirt was similarly embroidered with red and blue threads. </p><p class="calibre3">(Th, That......) 　</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou was stunned. It was impossible. The other party was the mummy girl. It was supposed to be an unattractive creature dressed in filthy bandages. How could she be so cute? She had such huge breasts. And she had blonde hair.......</p>

<p class="calibre3">"Cute......" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto let out his thoughts. Mimia blushes happily. </p><p class="calibre3">"She's cute, right? She's really cute, isn't she?" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Hiroto turns to face Senterio. </p><p class="calibre3">"Ha, Haa......"</p><p class="calibre3">"There's no shame in having visitors, is there?"</p><p class="calibre3">"That's, well......" </p><p class="calibre3">"I thought you'd look really cute in proper clothes" 　</p><p class="calibre3">Mimia was red up to her ears. </p><p class="calibre3">"I will serve you to the best of my ability. Please treat me well" 　</p><p class="calibre3">She bowed her head. More and more cute. Souichirou wondered if he should have said he would be the castle lord. Then he himself.......</p><p class="calibre3">"Emm......can I serve you now?" </p><p class="calibre3">(What? Service!?)</p><p class="calibre3">An obscene fantasy ran through his mind. No way he was going to drop his pants――. After bowing again, Mimia stripped off the sheets and blanket and went out on the balcony. She hung them up and returned again. Then she took Hiroto's clothes and left the room. Apparently, "serving" meant working as a caretaker. Hiroto was a little embarrassed that he had interpreted it sexually. </p><p class="calibre3">"Basically, the caretaker is always with Hiroto-sama"　</p><p class="calibre3">Senterio explained. </p><p class="calibre3">"So you'll be accompanying me to the inspection?" </p><p class="calibre3">"If Hiroto-sama wishes it" </p><p class="calibre3">"Then I wish"</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you riding a horse together?"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou asked. </p><p class="calibre3">"Yes"</p><p class="calibre3">Souichirou almost fainted. Riding together means that chest is on Hiroto's back.......</p>
