<h3>Chapter 4 - My First Date With My First Girlfriend.</h3>

<p>Today was a Saturday.</p>



<p>A Saturday when school was not in session, a Saturday when nothing was planned, a Saturday as usual…a day off where I could amuse myself with games in the morning.</p>



<p>It was a holiday that I&#8217;ve been looking forward to, usually one or two days out of the week.</p>



<p>Of course, it was supposed to be that, but…</p>



<p>My mornings are always filled with joy when I play social games, and yet, today, I feel out of sorts, or rather, strange.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like I can&#8217;t concentrate, or I want to do something else right away.</p>



<p>(My date with Nanami-san is tomorrow…today she said she&#8217;s going to the movies with her two friends. Two days in a row, she&#8217;s going to the movies…frankly, I wonder if that&#8217;s a bad idea…?)</p>



<p>I was playing the game with this in mind when my party was wiped out.</p>



<p>『 It&#8217;s rare to see Canyon-san getting wiped out. Is his heart not in the right place?』</p>



<p>『Is something wrong….?』</p>



<p>Both Baron-san and Peach-san were worried about me. The reason for my<br>destruction was just a careless mistake. It&#8217;s the kind of destruction that rarely happens to people who are used to playing games.</p>



<p>Currently, I lack concentration to the point that it interferes with my gaming. I know the cause myself. That&#8217;s…</p>



<p>&#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s the first date with my girlfriend, so I&#8217;ve been thinking about it this whole time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Or, to be more precise, tomorrow&#8217;s date…and Nanami-san, so I wasn&#8217;t able to concentrate well. I already made the perfect preparations for tomorrow…I think.</p>



<p>I bought our tickets online and chose our seats. At first, we were thinking about meeting up at the movie theatre…but I suggest we don&#8217;t do that.</p>



<p>Considering what happened with Senpai, the probability of Nanami-san meeting with some strange pick-up artist looks pretty high. With such a pretty girl all by herself, there would be very few who wouldn&#8217;t pick up on her. No, I for sure wouldn&#8217;t do that, but. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s someone out there who would.</p>



<p>To such worries, she simply said this.</p>



<p>『Well then, do you want me to pick you up at your house?』</p>



<p>It was pretty simple if you think about it. If I picked her up at her house, there was virtually no worry at all about her getting picked on by some random stranger. I accepted her scintillating suggestion…and instead of going &#8216;there&#8217; to meet her, I went to Nanami-san&#8217;s house to pick her up instead.</p>



<p>At first, she wanted to come to my house to pick me up. But, just as you&#8217;d expect, I politely declined because I felt that would ruin my pride as a man, and that would be the same for others, even if it wasn&#8217;t me.</p>



<p>So yesterday, I dropped her off at her house for the first time before going home. Therefore, yesterday was the longest day I&#8217;ve spent with Nanami-san so far. It was a good day.</p>



<p>……By no means whatsoever did I plan to use that excuse as a reason to know the location of her house.</p>



<p>『I wonder if this is how people who live together go home together. Isn&#8217;t that something to admire?』</p>



<p>Nanami-san told me such a thing on the way home, and all I could do was panic.</p>



<p>Well, Nanami-san did say, &#8220;Sorry, please forget that…&#8221; before self-exploding. She was also red up to her ears.</p>



<p>I went home with Nanami-san to the same house… Just imagining it makes me writhe in agony.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m kind of restless to think that Sunday will break the record for the longest time we&#8217;ve been together.</p>



<p>It makes me feel kind of restless.</p>



<p>I thought about contacting her, but I felt bad about dampening the excitement between us, so I held back. </p>



<p>By the way, Nanami-san gave me a detailed report every step of the way. This again resulted in an acceleration of my restlessness for tomorrow.</p>



<p>『The movie was really good. I was a little embarrassed about the H scenes, but…I think I learned a lot from it? I&#8217;ll be looking forward to more in the future, okay? 』</p>



<p>Nanami-san, what did you learn, what are you looking forward to? I&#8217;m a little confused…</p>



<p>『 I&#8217;m eating hamburgers for lunch. What about you, Youshin? I wish I could make lunch for you on your days off, maybe next time I could make you lunch?』</p>



<p>At lunchtime, I recalled Nanami-san&#8217;s usual handmade bento, and the cup noodles that I usually find delicious suddenly seemed tasteless……</p>



<p>『I can&#8217;t wait for tomorrow. I want to see you soon. I&#8217;ll call you at night, okay? Let&#8217;s have a fun date tomorrow.』</p>



<p>Sending me such cute little messages like that, along with pictures of food and where she was at the moment. That&#8217;s right. There was no way I could get into the game.</p>



<p>However, it felt a little out of place…I thought girls were supposed to take selfies of themselves in such situations? The photos sent to me never show Nanami-san. Why is that? …well, that&#8217;s okay.</p>



<p>I was grinning from beginning to end, which, even if I say so myself, was sickening.</p>



<p>『 That&#8217;s good, tis youth, after all……How can you not be excited about your first date ……? Are you ready for it?』</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s perfect. I&#8217;ll pick her up at her house.&#8221;</p>



<p>『I see, I see. Hum Hum…… don&#8217;t worry about the game tomorrow, and have fun to your heart&#8217;s content.』</p>



<p>『……Please take care.』</p>



<p>Oh, Peach-san gave a supportive comment for the first time. This feels deeply moving… I thought.</p>



<p>『Please be careful not to have your heart broken if she says terrible things about how boring the movie was, how uninteresting the date was, or how it sucked.』</p>



<p>That&#8217;s different…she may be supportive, but it&#8217;s somewhat negative. I feel like her darkness is getting deeper and deeper. Does she really dislike gal-types that much?</p>



<p>『Peach-san, don&#8217;t say such a thing. But I agree. You should escort her properly so that she doesn&#8217;t say that. That way, you&#8217;ll be more likeable. No, I think your likeability is already near the max…』</p>



<p>Indeed, if I take Peach-san&#8217;s words directly, it could be said that the success or failure of tomorrow&#8217;s date depends on me.</p>



<p>As for me, I&#8217;ve only spent a few days with her, but being together with Nanami-san is fun.</p>



<p>But, if you think about it, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean she&#8217;s having fun. This was a good lesson for me. I&#8217;ll be careful.</p>



<p>『So? What are you planning to wear for your date on that day?』</p>



<p>&#8220;Clothes…? What kind of clothes…?&#8221;</p>



<p>Clothes……to wear on a date…….</p>



<p>Huh? What kind of clothes am I planning to wear for my date? Can&#8217;t I just wear my everyday clothes?</p>



<p>&#8220;For now, the clothes at my house…are almost exclusively black. I think I have some loose-fitting, comfortable trousers…and maybe some jeans?&#8221;</p>



<p>My words made Baron-san come to a stop…and then…</p>



<p>『Canyon-san…you get along with your Senpai, right? Could you take a few body photos and send them to your Senpai, please?』</p>



<p>『Canyon-san…indeed…are you not in the right mind…?』</p>



<p>I received concerned messages from both of them. Even Peach-san, who had been so negative earlier, wrote to me as if she was worried about something. Did I do something wrong?</p>



<p>I changed from my loungewear, a jersey, to my regular clothes.</p>



<p>Other than my uniform and loungewear, I only go out to buy games or books, so I don&#8217;t have that many everyday clothes to wear.</p>



<p>At any rate, I try them on and……Well, how shall I take a picture of my whole body?</p>



<p>Ah, I remember I have a mirror that my dad uses that shows my entire body…….Let me use that.</p>



<p>My parents, who were at home, tilted their heads when I suddenly started taking full-body pictures of myself. Ignoring their stares, I took a picture of my whole body and then sent a message to my Senpai.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this a good time, Senpai? I&#8217;d like to discuss this with you…….Can I ask you to look at what I&#8217;m going to wear on my date with Nanami-san tomorrow for a minute?&#8221;</p>



<p>About ten minutes later, a response from my Senpai arrived.</p>



<p>『To think you have the audacity to ask me such a thing after I&#8217;ve been so harshly rejected. Okay, I&#8217;m currently on a break from my club activities right now, so you can send it to me.』</p>



<p>Indeed, if you look at my behaviour right now, I&#8217;m pretty cruel. But the only person I can rely on for fashion at the moment is Senpai.</p>



<p>I only know everyone on the social game team online, and I feel like some of the people I talk to at school are the only people who would buy anything other than clothes. To begin with, I don&#8217;t even know their contact information.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that you&#8217;re the only person I can rely on, Senpai. Then, I&#8217;ll send you the pictures.&#8221;</p>



<p>I sent a picture of myself to my Senpai, and he immediately read it. And the reply from my Senpai was swift.</p>



<p>『Misumai, I&#8217;m not very well-informed about fashion since I&#8217;m mostly preoccupied with basketball……so at least listen with that premise in mind.』</p>



<p>Senpai had made such a preamble…I wonder if there was something funny about it.</p>



<p>『 Why&#8217;s your top and bottom all black!? Why are you wearing black underwear, black outerwear, and black pants? Are you a natural-born ninja or assassin? Also, what&#8217;s that red writing on your shirt? The letters stand out so much because everything is all black, isn&#8217;t that scary!?』</p>



<p>&#8220;Senpai, I didn&#8217;t send you a picture of me in my underwear, did I? I&#8217;m wearing green boxer shorts right now.&#8221;</p>



<p>『You don&#8217;t have to tell me!! Underwear, in this case, means pants (Note: specifically long pants). You don&#8217;t have to slip a stupid joke in there, okay?!』</p>



<p>I see. I&#8217;ve always called them pants, so I was unfamiliar with that terminology. Oh, so pants are also called underwear? Well, then, what do you call underwear then? No, that&#8217;s not important.</p>



<p>『Misumai, you, perhaps, are all the clothes you own like that?』</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;ve only got similar kinds of clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>『Go buy some clothes now! It&#8217;s no problem at a mass retailer of casual wear!! And send me a full body photo every step of the way!! 』</p>



<p>……Apparently, my attire was a complete no-no. Nevertheless, Senpai said that he would check my every move even though he was in the middle of club activities. I&#8217;m extremely grateful.</p>



<p>I see, so this was also no good. No, I knew half of that. But I didn&#8217;t expect it to be this bad.</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. Thank you, Senpai.&#8221;</p>



<p>『Yeah. I&#8217;m in the middle of club activities too, so I may not be able to look at it too often…I recommend that you talk to the clerk to make sure you&#8217;re talking to the right person. Look, the basics are simple.』</p>



<p>I sent a thank you message again, but from then on, I never heard back. Maybe he&#8217;s back in the club. I don&#8217;t know. After I finished communicating with Senpai, I told Baron-san and the others that I was leaving the game.</p>



<p>『Yeah, good for you…to ask about clothes.』</p>



<p>『……I never thought that it would be that bad.』</p>



<p>Even the two of them said such things to me, and I suddenly felt embarrassed to go shopping for clothes in the clothes I always go out in. I see, so this is the so-called state of『having no clothes to go shopping for clothes.』</p>



<p>However, I&#8217;ve already readied myself to go out and buy it. I withdrew my money and went on to a mass retailer in a shopping mall in town, albeit a little far away.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, Nanami-san and I will be coming to the movie theatre, so let&#8217;s have a preliminary inspection on that as well.</p>



<p>And so began my first date outfit selection.</p>



<p>At first, at the mass retailer, I was like, &#8220;Huh, clothes aren&#8217;t that expensive, are they?&#8221; I looked at each piece of clothing and thought lightly, but it was pretty expensive to get them all.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the kind of money a student who doesn&#8217;t work a part-time job should have…</p>



<p>Due to that, I slightly regretted not getting a part-time job. I&#8217;m not sure what type of part-time work I can do, but money is essential.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, didn&#8217;t Nanami-san have a part-time job? Having a part-time job together with her…No, that&#8217;s no good. I&#8217;ll only be repeating mistakes by looking at Nanami-san all the time.</p>



<p>Choosing clothes took quite a bit of time because I had to try them on and send the pictures to my Senpai.</p>



<p>Senpai was very conscientious and gave me accurate feedback on the pictures.</p>



<p>『Too many choices can be confusing, so you should limit yourself to black skinnies on the bottom. From there, let&#8217;s choose what to wear on top. It&#8217;s your first date, so let&#8217;s keep it fresh.』</p>



<p>As advised by my Senpai, I chose a pair of skinny black pants, a thick white and navy striped shirt, a white outer shirt, and a simple, unadorned belt.</p>



<p>When I told him that my shoes were actually all black as well, he told me to buy a pair of light blue sneakers at a different store.</p>



<p>Finally, I sent a full-body photo of myself to Senpai, and he said,『That&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s safe. It looks fresh.』, so I guess it&#8217;s okay.</p>



<p>I thanked my Senpai and was told 『If you want to thank me, I&#8217;ll gladly accept Barato&#8217;s bento』, to which I politely declined.</p>



<p>However, as a thank you, I told Senpai that I will casually ask Nanami-san if she&#8217;s willing to share one side dish with him. </p>



<p>Even so, I immediately received a reply that conveyed tremendous joy. Do you really want to eat it that much….</p>



<p>However, I blew up more than twice the amount I usually spend on buying clothes……Well, let&#8217;s just take it as a good opportunity. Now I just have to be careful not to let my parents find out about it. They&#8217;ll definitely think that something is wrong if they do.</p>



<p>Ah…I just bought a few clothes, and yet I suddenly got tired.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go home early and relax for tomorrow&#8217;s date……While I was thinking about that……I heard a familiar voice in my ear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, will you quit it? We all have boyfriends, and we don&#8217;t want to be here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s only you three girls, right? Come play with us. It&#8217;ll be fun. As long as your boyfriend doesn&#8217;t find out, you&#8217;ll be fine, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked toward the familiar voice…and saw Nanami-san&#8217;s friend, Otofuke-san there. Come to think of it, Nanami-san did say that the three of them were going to see a movie today, so I was wondering if the girls would come…</p>



<p>As I looked at them again from a small distance…..I was a little puzzled by the unusual atmosphere of the girls.</p>



<p>There was Otofuke-san, Kamiechi-san, and…one unknown girl, the three of them were being picked up by three flirtatious-looking boys.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about whether or not they&#8217;ll find out, it&#8217;s that when you have a boyfriend, it&#8217;s impossible to play with another man. If you want to pick up girls, go somewhere else.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it so coldly~. You&#8217;re dressed like that, so you&#8217;re playing anyway, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Otofuke-san was wearing shorts with both shoulders exposed, while Kamiechi-san was boldly exposing her chest and shoulders while wearing a pendant as an accessory. It gave off the impression of gal-type fashion.</p>



<p>Even in uniform, her skirt was short, so her legs were exposed as usual but I&#8217;m more nervous about the exposed shoulders that I don&#8217;t usually see. ……No, I&#8217;m nervous about the legs, too.</p>



<p>The other girl was dressed rather maturely. I wonder if she&#8217;s the neat and tidy type?</p>



<p>With as little skin exposed as possible, she wore a long fluffy skirt. That is to say, she was dressed exactly the opposite of them.</p>



<p>She wore glasses, which matched the gentle expression that she was giving off. I&#8217;ve never seen this girl before, at least not in school.<br></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pmO881zEsoVSNT2TYEWd0Nz1bJ-cMOUrY79xMuxVsWesAMtc7vjWNGc3TnbzA1lEw8ugVltl_UdheiDyq0uTvX4U1k3iYiu6aKq-om4WXJ7giFfCXQ0eKea_I90GnTOev2lPRJ-I" width="624" height="871"></p>



<p>I wonder if they&#8217;ve already broken off with Nanami-san and are playing with another friend today?</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s not important. First of all, let&#8217;s sort out this situation.</p>



<p>The girls are being picked up.</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t want to be picked up.</p>



<p>I witnessed it.</p>



<p>Now, should I help them or not?</p>



<p>Well, I should help them. I don&#8217;t need to think about it.</p>



<p>If I abandon her friends, I won&#8217;t be able to face Nanami-san on our date tomorrow. So it&#8217;s a decision to help.</p>



<p>Surely, the protagonist of the story, overflowing with a sense of justice, could manage to go at it without thinking about the consequences. ……However, I&#8217;ve never been in a fight, and there were three of them. It&#8217;s a pity, but if they commit an act of violence, then it&#8217;ll be their loss.</p>



<p>Therefore, let&#8217;s put on some insurance.</p>



<p>I searched for that little bit of insurance…and then approached the three people who were being picked on. They were just about to grab the girl&#8217;s hands. That was close.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, what a coincidence. All three of you were here? Are those people your friends?&#8221;</p>



<p>I greet the group with a beaming smile and call out to them with as much friendliness as possible. I don&#8217;t call them by their names. Privacy is important.</p>



<p>The three girls turned to me as if surprised by my sudden appearance, but…the men raised their eyebrows and gave me an irritated look for calling them out so abruptly.</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Who are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>They were at a low boiling point.</p>



<p>I wish I had a fresher smile on my face, like when I talked to the girls. Well, the smile was not too subtle.</p>



<p>The one who was threatening me and was most aggressive in talking to the girls was a handsome man with long brown hair that reached his shoulders, wearing a slantwise hat.</p>



<p>However, he wasn&#8217;t as handsome as Shibetsu-Senpai. He was a degraded Senpai. I don&#8217;t mean to be rude to Senpai, so I&#8217;ll just call him that in my mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m their…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah!? If this has nothing to do with you, then stay out of it, you Cockroach man. You don&#8217;t want to see the pain, do you? Now get out of my sight.&#8221;</p>



<p>…….At least let me finish my sentence. They told me I had nothing to do with it, and I even got the dishonourable nickname &#8220;Cockroach man&#8221;.</p>



<p>The two men behind him also looked at me, grinning and laughing at the words of the degraded Senpai. Degraded Senpai vs Cockroach man…sounds like a B-tier movie title. It doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;ll be a hit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you listening to me!? If you have nothing to do with this, then get the hell out of here!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not unrelated, errr…I&#8217;m…&#8221;</p>



<p>I look at them, a little freaked out by the boys yelling at me.</p>



<p>From the looks of it, even if I say I&#8217;m their friend, it&#8217;s irrelevant. What should I say? I saw that Otofuke-san and the other two were shooting me worried glances.</p>



<p>The one who looked particularly worried was a mature girl I didn&#8217;t recognize. She was looking at me as if she was about to cry.</p>



<p>My gaze crosses with hers. I looked at her and signalled. Yeah, I&#8217;m sorry for making you worry. I smiled to reassure her.</p>



<p>….Hmm?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s something familiar…about her eyes. That eye, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, could it be…? No, but…I&#8217;m not quite sure.</p>



<p>But……sorry if I&#8217;m wrong, Nanami-san. I apologize in my mind to my girlfriend. Then I pointed to a girl I didn&#8217;t recognize among the three.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the boyfriend of that girl over there. As her boyfriend, it&#8217;s only natural for me to help her if she&#8217;s being picked on, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t recognize the girl I pointed to. That&#8217;s for sure. But I did recognize her eyes, which were looking at me with concern.</p>



<p>I told them that I was that girl&#8217;s boyfriend.</p>



<p>And then the three men burst out laughing when they heard that. Was it something so funny?　</p>



<p>Their anger and laughter were at a low boiling point,</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re that geeky girl&#8217;s boyfriend? Alright then, just take her home with you. Cockroach man and plain glasses make a good match. We&#8217;ll just take the other girls…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t work that way. The other girls don&#8217;t like it either, right? I can&#8217;t just leave her friends behind.&#8221;</p>



<p>This time, I interrupted degraded Senpai&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>I must have really pissed him off because he grabbed me by the collar and yelled at me as if he were about to punch me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to act cool, you bastard!! If you don&#8217;t want to be killed, get your ass out of here!! Do you want me to get rid of you and your girlfriend too!? Haa!?&#8221;</p>



<p>At the very moment I was grabbed by the collar, the insurance I had taken out arrived. Even though I had predicted it, the timing was perfect.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing, sir…? Would you please come this way so as not to disturb the others?&#8221;</p>



<p>There were several strong looking security guards.</p>



<p>They surrounded the men, including us, to keep them from escaping. I was surprised to see that there were more people than I had anticipated.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah? …No….we aren&#8217;t particularly doing anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, security. You&#8217;ve come to the right place. He attempted an assault. Could you please call the police?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh!? What do you mean by assault!? I didn&#8217;t do anything!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The man(Degraded-Senpai), who was still holding my collar, glared at me and raised his voice with a mix of surprise and anger.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know? Just grabbing someone&#8217;s chest is a charge of assault. There are so many eyewitnesses, so you can&#8217;t get away with it. The police will arrest you.&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried my best to calmly tell the truth while desperately holding down my body, which was almost shaking with fear. It was hard to keep my voice from trembling.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve heard stories like that before, though my knowledge is based on what I heard on the internet. Well, it&#8217;s just a scare tactic since it&#8217;s actually not that easy to call the police…</p>



<p>As though frozen by the word &#8220;arrest,&#8221; he couldn&#8217;t take his hand off my chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you two be just as guilty with this guy?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned my head to the two remaining men, not caring about the man who was still holding my collar.</p>



<p>I look at them and open my mouth.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t mean to say that they were guilty of the same crime just because they were with him…but when they met my gaze, the smile they had on their faces just had faded away, and they instantly looked worried.</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Oh…we have nothing to do with him. That guy just said let&#8217;s pick up a girl and… He&#8217;s the one who grabbed you by the collar, so he&#8217;s the one who should be arrested.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s right. We just hung out with the guy. We have nothing to do with him. I don&#8217;t care. Hey, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>Are these people&#8217;s friendships that fragile……Two of the Degraded Senpai&#8217;s companions try to leave the box surrounded by security guards.</p>



<p>The man(Degraded Senpai) had a look of despair and anger mixed towards them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s indeed the only one grabbing him by the collar…the two of you probably have nothing to do with it. So you can go.&#8221;</p>



<p>They seemed relieved to hear their words, and then they broke through a small gap within the crowd of security guards and made their way.</p>



<p>They really just abandoned him fast…</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi! Wait, you guys! You guys!!&#8221;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the abandoned man(Degraded Senpai) finally let go of my collar and tried to chase after them while they were running away…but he was stopped by the security guards.</p>



<p>Not that I really want to prosecute him for assault or anything, so I&#8217;ll just leave the rest to the guards as it is. I don&#8217;t care about the rest once we get the girls out of here……</p>



<p>The first thing I did was to thank the guards and run over to the three of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are the three of you alright? Sorry I couldn&#8217;t help you guys in a cool way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, no. Thank you, Misumai. If it weren&#8217;t for you, I would&#8217;ve nearly punched them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I really thought that Hatsumi was going to beat that guy to a pulp, but I&#8217;m relieved.&#8221;</p>



<p>Otofuke-san made a fist and brought it in front of herself, and Kamiechi-san looked at it worriedly.</p>



<p>…Hey? Could they actually have managed this on their own without my help?</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re strong, aren&#8217;t you, Otofuke-san…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m often picked up when I&#8217;m dressed like this. To protect myself…I have my boyfriend train me. Perhaps, he&#8217;s even stronger than most men.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hatsumi&#8217;s boyfriend is her stepbrother. Have you heard of Otofuke Souichirou?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Step-siblings can get married, so there&#8217;s no problem.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I was not familiar with martial arts and had never heard of that name. But if such an older brother was training her, I wonder if I did something unnecessary.</p>



<p>However…it seems that Otofuke-san is a very strong person. Her stepbrother being her boyfriend sounds like something out of a comic book.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, if that&#8217;s the case, I wonder if I did something unnecessary?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, thank you for rescuing me. If that was my stepbrother, he would&#8217;ve drilled holes into those persistent bastards…I-I mean boyfriend, since he said that he&#8217;ll bodyguard me all the way.</p>



<p>If so, I&#8217;m glad to hear it…? I hope that doesn&#8217;t mean I did anything unnecessary.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, Misumai, that was amazing. Is this also the power of love? Hey, Nanami? It&#8217;s time to stop pouting and join in on the conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kamiechi-san called out to the quiet girl behind her. I finally realized that my prediction was correct.</p>



<p>I looked into her eyes again…and I knew I recognized those shining eyes behind those glasses. Those beautiful eyes were…</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Un…yes…Youshin…thanks for helping me. A-Also, I&#8217;m glad that you recognized me…even in this outfit…&#8221;</p>



<p>There she was, dressed entirely different from school…Nanami-san was dressed in an outfit that could be said to be the complete opposite of the one she wore at school.</p>



<p>…Well, I wasn&#8217;t actually sure. But I was wondering if that was the case.</p>



<p>&#8220;I like gal fashion, but I also like to dress like this… When I hang out with the two of them, I tend to dress like this…um…did I disappoint you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…That&#8217;s not true. You&#8217;re cute, and it looks good on you. You see, I&#8217;m such a dark cockroach, all-black up and down. I wonder if this is what you call a bad outfit?&#8221;</p>



<p>Otofuke-san and Kamiechi-san laughed at my words. Yes, that was a casually good expression. As for me, I was more pleased than angry.</p>



<p>Well, I&#8217;m glad I bought clothes today. I got to meet Nanami-san and save her from a pick-up. I could have done without the pick-up artist, though.</p>



<p>&#8220;But still, how did you know it was me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the power of love, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that true Misumai-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>When they said that, my feelings of guilt rose to the surface. I didn&#8217;t save her because I was sure she was Nanami-san. I know they&#8217;ll be disappointed if I tell them that, but let&#8217;s be honest.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, sorry. I thought the eyes looked familiar, but I wasn&#8217;t sure. I just thought she looked like Nanami-san. Are you disappointed?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing my words, Nanami-san slowly shook her head and smiled at me. She was wearing glasses and dressed differently than usual, but that smile was her usual smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not disappointed. I&#8217;m just happy that Youshin&#8217;s a kind and gentle person who helps me even when you don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. I&#8217;m glad. It was scary, but it was worth the effort.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now I know why she never sends me a picture of herself. I guess she was hesitant to show me her appearance. But I think that&#8217;s kind of cute, too.</p>



<p>For a little while, Nanami-san and I looked at each other, forgetting who was around us. That alone made me feel happy.</p>



<p>What interrupted this was what the two were saying to each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;M-Man, it&#8217;s hot, isn&#8217;t it? Why don&#8217;t you two go on a date? Oh wait, you guys have another date tomorrow, right? Two days in a row?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s time to go!&#8221;</p>



<p>With those words, we were brought back to reality. Nanami-san was angry at the two of them for teasing her, and I couldn&#8217;t help but smile faintly.</p>



<p>I thought that it would be okay if the two of them agreed, but…I looked down at my own outfit and reconsidered it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to, but I&#8217;m here today to buy clothes for tomorrow&#8217;s date…..so the three of you can have fun today as planned.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Youshin, did you come all the way here…to buy new clothes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you see. I only have this kind of clothes, so I thought doing this was just right. I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow in something a little different, so please look forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nanami-san looked a little apologetic.</p>



<p>Please don&#8217;t make that kind of face.</p>



<p>Because seeing Nanami-san now, I&#8217;m glad I came to buy clothes after all. When I look at my own outfit again, it really was pitch black, and it makes me feel embarrassed just standing next to Nanami-san.</p>



<p>I should be satisfied just to see her today, even if it was unexpected. Any more than this, and I feel like I can&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. You do what you gotta do, Misumai. Well then, better save the fun for tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll borrow her for today. See you, Misumai.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two seemed convinced and took Nanami-san, who still seemed a little reluctant to leave the place, with them. I bid farewell to Nanami-san with a &#8220;see you tomorrow,&#8221; and she silently shook her head and followed them.</p>



<p>Then, as I turned around, Nanami-san&#8217;s question hit my back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Youshin…which one do you want to see tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned around and looked at Nanami-san. It was a very difficult question, but I thought about it in my own way and answered with a smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Either way is fine, as long as Nanami-san is dressed in a way that is natural for her.&#8221;</p>



<p>She smiled happily at my answer, though it seemed to annoy her when I requested lunch.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>And thus, today was the day of the date. It was a Sunday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Nanami-san. It&#8217;s a little early, but I&#8217;m here to pick you up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Good morning, Youshin. Thanks for yesterday.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got in touch with Nanami-san from a place just slightly off the spot of her home and met her as soon as she came out. It was a painstaking effort to avoid bumping into her family.</p>



<p>I guess it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem if we met, but I was a little embarrassed to have them see me like this. It was like a secret meeting, and I got a little excited.</p>



<p>Her outfit was a little more mature today.</p>



<p>She donned a white blouse and a long pale blue skirt. However, she still looked a little gyaru-like here and there. From her blouse, her shoulders were exposed, and her earrings, with other sorts of accessories, seemed to shine.</p>



<p>It was like a fusion of mature clothes and gyaru fashion…I can&#8217;t think of any words to describe this with my vocabulary. How do I say it?</p>



<p>The only thing I could understand was that she was cute.</p>



<p>I put on the clothes I bought yesterday for the first time, and I felt a little uncomfortable, but…if you were to think about it, this was an outfit that allowed me to stand next to her at present.</p>



<p>I really appreciate the help of Baron-san and Senpai. Without them, I would&#8217;ve been standing before her, dressed in pitch black attire. Even after all this time, I still feel horrified. Ignorance is a terrible thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re giving off a different mood today. It suits you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…after all, I thought if I dressed this way, my dad wouldn&#8217;t notice that I was going out on a date with a boy. He must think I&#8217;m going to play with Hatsumi and Ayumi again today.&#8221;</p>



<p>Apparently, Nanami-san kept the fact that we were dating a secret from her family. Well, I&#8217;m keeping it a secret too.</p>



<p>In my case, there was no deeper meaning to it. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s kind of hard for me to say. I wonder how many high school students report to their parents that they have a girlfriend?</p>



<p>Though…my parents may be onto something.</p>



<p>Yesterday, they were surprised because I bought some very unusual clothes and they were not black, but they didn&#8217;t mention anything else. My dad just nodded and said, &#8220;I see, I see.&#8221;, looking somewhat emotional.</p>



<p>And then, this morning, when I woke up, they were no longer there, but there was more money than usual placed on the table for living expenses in the absence of my parents.</p>



<p>This has never happened to me before. I was grateful, but I was too scared to say anything about it…No, let&#8217;s leave my parents out of it for now.</p>



<p>Today, I felt somewhat invincible and all-powerful, perhaps because my clothes were different. I have to escort Nanami-san firmly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Ah…Youshin, that&#8217;s right…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It suits you. You look good in that outfit.&#8221;</p>



<p>….Darn, she said it first.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right. This was what I was lacking. Why couldn&#8217;t I say the word &#8216;cute&#8217; out loud first?</p>



<p>Besides, that&#8217;s sly, doing that in the morning. She flashed me a smile resembling that of blooming cherry blossoms, and I couldn&#8217;t help but look back at her, my face turning a deep red.</p>



<p>My sense of invincibility and all powerfulness in my heart was blown away in one fell swoop. Instead, it was filled with another……a sense of happiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san…that outfit, it suits you too…and…i-it looks cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>I did my best to counterattack, but she just muttered, &#8220;I know.&#8221;, and came up next to me, taking my hand in hers.</p>



<p>I felt somewhat relieved to see her hand, the same as always… Even though she was so nervous just by taking my hand in hers a while ago, I wonder if this is what it means to grow up?</p>



<p>Ah, Nanami-san&#8217;s ears are red, so she seems a little pleased. Does that mean that was a successful counterattack?</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, today I decided on that American comic book movie that Nanami-san wanted to see. You said you hadn&#8217;t seen it yet. I already bought the tickets online and saved the seats.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you could do that. I always bought it on the spot when I went with the other two….So, did you make sure to get the couple&#8217;s seat?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t……and you know that a cinema doesn&#8217;t have that. Don&#8217;t make fun of me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I forced a smile at Nanami-san, who showed her teeth and laughed strangely with a &#8220;nishishi.&#8221; Well, our seats were made to be neighbours, so it&#8217;s like an actual couple seat.</p>



<p>Even though her outfit had changed quite a bit, she was still Nanami-san on the inside. She often teases me, but she also self-destructs frequently. Being able to go out on a date with such a cute girl, I must be the happiest man in the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;ve never seen this series before, but do you think I&#8217;ll be able to enjoy it as someone who&#8217;s watching it for the first time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, I think it&#8217;s alright. I&#8217;m one of those people who saw it halfway through and got hooked. But I haven&#8217;t seen the whole series.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Well, that&#8217;s fine. Last I checked, there were more than 20 films in this series.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If Youshin gets into it too, let&#8217;s rent it and watch it together next time. Well, even if you&#8217;re not into it, I&#8217;d still make you watch it with me tho.&#8221;</p>



<p>Watching all twenty works together…that feels like a dream. A month is probably not long enough to finish the whole series.</p>



<p>No, if I push myself, I might be able to do it. Wait, that&#8217;s not what she&#8217;s saying.</p>



<p>How does she feel about this relationship?</p>



<p>Is it as practice, is it out of a sense of obligation for the punishment game, or is it because…she really likes me? Sometimes, she also looks sad and guilty.</p>



<p>I was aware that our relationship was the result of a punishment game.<br>But she smiled at me, not knowing that I knew that.</p>



<p>It was a carefree smile, with not a single shred of malice hidden within.</p>



<p>Every time I saw that smile, I felt like I was deceiving her.</p>



<p>Preferably, I&#8217;d like to have some male friends, possibly the best friend type, who&#8217;d realistically explain a girl&#8217;s(Nanami-san&#8217;s) mental state to me. Or, I&#8217;d like some convenient numbers and parameters who&#8217;d explain her current affection for me.</p>



<p>I had no idea because I had so little experience with such things.</p>



<p>『I&#8217;m sure she has the hots for you…although you&#8217;ve been together for less than a week, from your point of view, do you think she&#8217;s the kind of person who can deceive a guy? 』</p>



<p>The answer to Baron-san&#8217;s question was a no.</p>



<p>It was a very immediate answer.</p>



<p>For me to say such a thing, I know I&#8217;m overcomplicating things with my negativity, but I just can&#8217;t find the courage to take one more step. While I was thinking so…</p>



<p>&#8220;Youshin…? By some chance, are you one of those people who prefer watching movies alone?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her words snapped me back to reality. That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m on a date with her now. Let&#8217;s put these negative thoughts away at the moment and think about having fun with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the case. However, when it comes to renting the movie, it&#8217;ll inevitably be the two of us, which makes me nervous about watching it. Moreover, as a series, there&#8217;s a lot…it&#8217;ll probably take more than a month to finish it.&#8221;</p>



<p>At my words, her face was momentarily shadowed.</p>



<p>…Darn it, I&#8217;ve been so preoccupied with the punishment game just before that I blurted out the word one month. I&#8217;ve tried to avoid mentioning it as much as possible, but I failed.</p>



<p>The shadow on her face disappeared soon after, and then she closed her eyes and gave me a slight, imperceptibly sad smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, then, at least…until we&#8217;ve seen the whole series, let&#8217;s stick together, kay?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was at a loss of words when she said that. T-That&#8217;s, does that mean she&#8217;ll still go out with me even after a month? A-Am I allowed falling in love?</p>



<p>……The air&#8217;s starting to get weird, so I tried to blow this air out of the room with a light-hearted remark. I can&#8217;t let her look this sad. I need her to enjoy today.</p>



<p>Today was supposed to be a good day for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to feel terrible after watching the whole series, aren&#8217;t I? If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;ll have to stall watching it as long as possible…..As I have declared before, I have no intention of letting Nanami-san go.&#8221;<br>[Tl notes: Even Mc knows how terrible you&#8217;ll feel after watching finish one of your favourite series.]</p>



<p>After I said that, I thought to myself that it was somewhat unpleasant, but Nanami-san went back to her usual smile at my words. Thank God she didn&#8217;t pull away from me.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. The series will go on forever. They already have a new one scheduled for next year, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The longer the series runs, the safer our relationship will be.&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, we laughed at each other. At last, Nanami-san&#8217;s usual smile has returned. Relievidly stroking my chest, we headed to the movie theatre, hand in hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Just as I thought, you&#8217;ve been with a girl before, right? You seem oddly used to it, after all, you even went through the trouble of buying new clothes for the date.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. …… Even today, I was planning on coming to the date in yesterday&#8217;s clothes if my social game friend or Shibetsu-senpai hadn&#8217;t told me to, you know? But then they stopped me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what did he say?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shibetsu Senpi said this to me,『Are you a ninja or an assassin!?』. Isn&#8217;t that awful?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nanami-san blew up.</p>



<p>&#8220;…N-Ninja…Ninja you say…Ninja…Kufufu…Fufu …&#8221;</p>



<p>It seems like I hit her pressure point, her face turned over, shivering and trembling. I don&#8217;t really know what it was, but if she received it, then that&#8217;s good, I guess.</p>



<p>&#8220;S-So yesterday…y-you saved us with you&#8217;re ninja skills…a-again…t-thank you, ninja-san…hahaha…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….If I really was a ninja, I would&#8217;ve saved you more brilliantly.&#8221;</p>



<p>I kind of had mixed feelings about her thanks, given how her voice was quivering with laughter. As we moved along, talking like that, it was not long before we arrived at the movie theatre.</p>



<p>Redeem the tickets and buy some popcorn…yup, I&#8217;m all set.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here, I&#8217;ll give you half.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s no good. Today&#8217;s meant as a thank-you for all the Bentos you&#8217;ve made for me so far. How else can I repay you if you give me half of your lunch?&#8221;</p>



<p>Reluctantly, she agreed to my words. Somehow or another, I&#8217;m going to finish it today.</p>



<p>Should I give her a gift at this time?</p>



<p>Was what I thought at first. But, Baron-san stopped me from doing so.</p>



<p>『Um, I think it&#8217;s still a little too early for that. It seems a little heavy, don&#8217;t you think? If you were to give a gift, I think it would still be better if you gave it to her on your one-month anniversary or something.』</p>



<p>One month…One month.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll do my best, for our one month anniversary.</p>



<p>On those grounds, I&#8217;ll pay for today&#8217;s lunch, and after wandering around in the shopping mall, I&#8217;ll send Nanami-san home at night…and end today&#8217;s date. That&#8217;s the plan.</p>



<p>I was thinking about whether we should do even more, but ultimately, I decided against it.</p>



<p>While we were doing so, the movie began to run, and we watched the movie together.</p>



<p>While we sat there, neither Nanami-san nor I talked about whatever came to mind. How it&#8217;s weird that we&#8217;re together even on a Sunday, how we&#8217;re excited about the movie, and she even told me stuff about the story without spoiling too much…</p>



<p>I was surprised to find myself talking to someone like this. It was so different from my usual school life, being able to talk to a girl in a movie theatre in a normal setting.</p>



<p>Gradually, the screen lit up, and the lights in the theatre dimmed to match the surroundings. As the movie began, Nanami-san shifted her gaze to the screen.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t look at the screen but instead watched Nanami-san&#8217;s profile in the dimming light. In that split second, when the lights went out in total darkness, her profile was so beautiful.</p>



<p>It was so beautiful that it left a stronger impression on me than the movie.</p>



<p>When the theatre went dark, the movie started, and from then on, we were immersed in the movie without conversation. The content of the movie was indeed interesting. The action was spectacular, the storyline was profound, and we were excited by the sweaty development of the film.</p>



<p>Halfway, a romantic development is inserted, perhaps as part of the movie&#8217;s running gag. It was a kissing scene with the heroine, with the atmosphere of one about to make love, and I involuntarily looked at Nanami-san with a sidelong glance.</p>



<p>Then, for some reason, she also turned her gaze toward me, and our eyes met unexpectedly.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t speak but instead moved her mouth in a jerking motion as if wanting to tell me something. I think she wanted to tell me that she was feeling a little awkward.</p>



<p>I saw her smile lit up on the screen, and our hands touched one other. It was somehow different from when we were holding hands, and we continued to keep our hands on top of one another.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BZZrv8CePsPv0LP3wmTQd6GGHfxzCT0LOhfFnSPrfo4WqX4LHGMsJmigasiJHh6xRYeexRkAg8TXkIsbakrg0BabJ0GoNpNLddMvp-povSaEzano14f2Vy1YBzAO0Rv3wJuJmy5m" width="624" height="871"></p>



<p>In the end, our overlapping hands were separated by the time the movie got going, but the warmth of her hand still remained on mine.</p>



<p>Nanami-san was happily watching the movie. I was watching the movie, too, and my eyes were moving around impatiently, gazing at Nanami-san&#8217;s profile.</p>



<p>If I had chosen a romantic movie, would we still have kept our hands on each other?</p>



<p>I thought about such a thing.</p>



<p>That was when I realized I might have been paying more attention to Nanami-san than the movie.</p>



<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and Nanami-san was still very excited after seeing it. Still excited, we made our way toward a nearby coffee shop to share our thoughts.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what it&#8217;s like to get sweaty hands! The fighting scenes were so impressive and amazing! Moreover, that last scene!! It was so moving yet a little painful…after all, the hero has to fight for the sake of the earth!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, it was interesting. But, just as expected, not seeing the previous works made me question 『why?』 at some scenes of the movie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too. Getting into a series that I&#8217;ve never watched before makes me kind of interested……. I kind of get what a &#8220;compilation of a series&#8221; means now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So it was a story that even Nanami-san didn&#8217;t know about. Given how happy you looked, I was certain that you knew everything about the movie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…By any chance, were you still staring at my face after that without watching the movie?&#8221;</p>



<p>Darn it, did I get caught!? After our eyes met, I confessed to her that I repeatedly looked at her face, wondering what Nanami-san looked like at certain times of the movie.</p>



<p>She glared at me with half-open eyes, and I tried to gloss over it by averting my eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;L-Look, I was sitting right next to you, so it just so happened that I looked at you…just so happened, okay? I mean, Nanami-san, your eyes also met mine, didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nanami-san looked at me with her eyes half-closed for a moment as she listened to my excuses, but then, she sighed, as if to say, it can&#8217;t be helped, and showed a wry smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, our eyes met. I was surprised.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nanami-san didn&#8217;t say anything more than that. Nor did she bring up the fact that our hands touched. I couldn&#8217;t understand what she was thinking, but I didn&#8217;t dare mention it either.</p>



<p>Was she embarrassed, or swept away by the atmosphere, or…did she want to keep it a secret between the two of us?</p>



<p>After that, we would exchange our impressions, eat lunch together, and look at clothes together.</p>



<p>It was a lot of fun spending time together with her.</p>



<p>Time seemed to fly by, and before I knew it, it was already nearing the evening.</p>



<p>I thought about staying with her until the evening. But her parents would be worried if she stayed out this late at night, and, as you&#8217;d expect, I didn&#8217;t even have the guts to ask her out for dinner in the first place.</p>



<p>Eating dinner together with a girl, with just the two of us…I think it&#8217;s a relatively high hurdle.</p>



<p>&#8220;What should I do for dinner today…&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was sending Nanami-san home, I mumbled those words involuntarily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tonight? Aren&#8217;t you going to eat at home with your family?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, my parents are out on a business trip today. They&#8217;re planning on coming back tomorrow night.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, what&#8217;re you going to do for tonight?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I was thinking of buying some random side dishes, or maybe just going to a restaurant and eating out…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing my words, Nanami-san behaved like she was thinking of a little something before opening her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t do that. Your nutrition will be unbalanced, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm…but I don&#8217;t cook. Well, I can at least handle one meal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hum…I understand!&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought I had convinced Nanami-san with my words, but I was wrong.</p>



<p>She had a somewhat resolved expression on her face, with a strong determination in her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over to Youshin&#8217;s house and cook dinner for you today!!&#8221;</p>



<p>…Huh? Why did it turn out like this?</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>The scene happening in front of me right now…..is this real?</p>



<p>I pinched my cheek as hard as I could. The pain tells me that this scene in front of me is real. Yes, it hurts. But it still doesn&#8217;t feel real.</p>



<p>&#8220;Youshin&#8217;s home has a complete set of cooking utensils. Well, you don&#8217;t live alone, so that&#8217;s obvious. Is your mother the one who usually cooks?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…yeah. My mom or dad or……whoever comes home first usually cooks the food.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your dad cooks? That&#8217;s amazing. My dad can&#8217;t cook at all. The most he can do is make fried rice, I think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t cook at all, so I think Nanami-san&#8217;s dad is great enough. I can&#8217;t even cook a proper hamburger steak, and I doubt I can even make fried rice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you how to cook next time. A man who can cook gets high points, am I right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But…I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m scoring any points other than for Nanami-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>At my words, Nanami-san went silent. Did I say something strange?</p>



<p>Before my eyes was the scene of Nanami-san wearing an apron, cooking in my home kitchen, even though she was just cooking, this scene had a much stronger impact on me than the movie I saw today.</p>



<p>The best images are streaming before my eyes in real-time.</p>



<p>Is this something that I can view for free? Even movies can&#8217;t be seen for free. You have to pay money to see them…Ah, maybe I already paid them in a sense…</p>



<p>No, calm down. Let&#8217;s calm down. Anyway, how did this happen…let&#8217;s rewind time a little—just a little bit.</p>



<p>Nanami-san said,</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over to Youshin&#8217;s house and cook dinner for you today!!&#8221;</p>



<p>And before I could say anything else, she pulled her hand away and moved toward the food section of the shopping mall.</p>



<p>A girl bubbling with excitement and in high spirits, there was simply no way I could stop her…we arrived at the food section. In a scene that was unfamiliar to me, I stood by Nanami-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what were you planning on eating today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why, I never really thought about that. There&#8217;s a chain of dumpling restaurants not long from here, so I thought of having a dumpling set meal there…and it&#8217;s cheap.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gyoza, huh…I really want to make something that can help you sleep, but…Yeah, let&#8217;s make some dumplings then. Can you help me wrap them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yeah. If it&#8217;s something that I can do…&#8221;</p>



<p>Overwhelmed, I agreed to help with the cooking, which I had never done before. The least I could do at that time was to help wrap some dumplings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s go shopping…ah, wait a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>She stops to walk away and pulls out her phone. Then she begins to contact someone.</p>



<p>I could only watch the exchange, but she mumbled, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and put her phone away with a slight blush on her cheeks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? I&#8217;m just letting my mother know that I&#8217;ve decided to have dinner with Hatsumi and her family. Also, a quick note for Hatsumi…&#8221;</p>



<p>Like a mischievous child, Nanami-san stuck out her tongue.</p>



<p>I made you lie to your parents…I&#8217;m very sorry about that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go shopping. Do you know what ingredients are used for dumplings?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah, yeah. Naturally, it&#8217;s this, that…I think…I&#8217;m sure…maybe…&#8221;</p>



<p>She tilted her head and smiled a little meanly; however, it was a cute smile that revealed my stubborn nature…sorry, I have no idea at all.</p>



<p>Ground meat and garlic chives…oh, garlic?</p>



<p>She puts the ingredients into the basket smoothly with a steady hand. Nappa cabbage in dumplings? What do they use wakame seaweed, cabbage, and tomatoes for? Are these ingredients also for the dumplings?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, this? I&#8217;m thinking of making a salad and wakame seaweed soup, too, because gyoza alone doesn&#8217;t have enough vegetables. You&#8217;ll help me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best.&#8221;</p>



<p>So we bought the necessary ingredients.</p>



<p>Of course, I paid for the ingredients. She resisted to the end, saying she would split the bill, but I convinced her that I had more money and that I felt sorry for asking her to cook for me.</p>



<p>…..Dad and Mom, you didn&#8217;t anticipate this and gave me more, did you? If you did, then you&#8217;re way beyond normal espers.</p>



<p>And then, on the way back home…those few words she said still reverberate in my head even now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Buying ingredients for dinner and going home together is kind of like being…..newlyweds, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Such destructive words, I wonder if Nanami-san&#8217;s trying to kill me by making me writhe in agony. Even I couldn&#8217;t reply back with a sensible reply.</p>



<p>Speechless is precisely how I would describe it.</p>



<p>By the time we arrived at my place, she was in a good mood, while my heart felt like exploding, but…I was thrilled, overjoyed even.</p>



<p>And here we are now…….</p>



<p>I was in the process of filling the skin with the dumpling ingredients given to me by Nanami-san. Nanami-san taught me this by demonstrating how to make the first few pieces, but after that, I was on my own.</p>



<p>…Even though she showed me how to do it, I guess it can&#8217;t be helped if I can&#8217;t wrap them as well as she does. Nanami-san was now making the side dishes such as soup and salad, leaving the dumplings to me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not so sure since I didn&#8217;t really take the time to watch my mother cook, but I reckon she&#8217;s fairly skilled at it.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s just like a new wife.</p>



<p>…It&#8217;s no good. Nanami-san&#8217;s words a moment ago were so intense that my thoughts wandered in that direction. Now I&#8217;m a dumpling wrapping machine, mindlessly wrapping dumplings.</p>



<p>And then, Nanami-san, who had finished cooking in the kitchen, sat down in front of me and started wrapping the dumplings together with me. She was moving her hands twice as fast…no. She was moving it three times as fast.</p>



<p>Moreover, it had a beautiful form. It was a world&#8217;s difference from the dumplings I was currently wrapping. Funny, now, how I am supposed to be a dumpling wrapping machine…?</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san is beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…? What!? So suddenly!?&#8221;</p>



<p>……It seems that Nanami-san blushed needlessly due to my lack of words. The skin was torn, and one gyoza was sacrificed. Well, it should be okay if we bake it.</p>



<p>&#8220;See, the dumplings you wrapped are a world apart from the ones I made. Just as I thought, Nanami-san&#8217;s a good cook.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah, so that&#8217;s what you meant…but even Youshin&#8217;s first time is pretty good. My dad just fills in the ingredients to the brim and has them protrude out like that. And sometimes, he puts too much strength in it, and it tears.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we continued to talk while wrapping dumplings, a hill of dumplings piled up before we knew it. This is…I don&#8217;t even have to guess to say it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we made too many dumplings.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure enough, we did.&#8221;</p>



<p>In front of the pile of dumplings that was more than enough for two people, we looked at each other and laughed. This quantity is enough for five people…or maybe more.</p>



<p>&#8220;This portion looks difficult for two people. Besides, I got all worked up when I thought it was for Youshin……&#8221;</p>



<p>Nanami&#8217;s cheeks were slightly tinted as she clasped her hands in front of her face. Dumplings just for me…I&#8217;d love to eat all of them, but, just as you&#8217;d expect, this was way too much.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san, you can take the leftovers back home with you as a gift. I have school tomorrow, and I think this would make a good side dish for my lunch.&#8221;</p>



<p>Besides, I can&#8217;t think of any excuse for this amount of food when my parents come home tomorrow.</p>



<p>I never usually cook, so I don&#8217;t feel like I can explain why I went through all the trouble of making dumplings…and even if I did, I don&#8217;t think I can explain it well enough to keep my dating life a secret.</p>



<p>&#8220;…… I wonder if I should tell my mother that we had a dumpling party at Hatsumi&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nanami-san also seems to be keeping her relationship a secret from her family, but unlike me, she seems to have an advantage in that she has friends she can rely on in times like these.</p>



<p>In my case, I have classmates to whom I only spoke a few words in school, but I doubt I can call them my friends.</p>



<p>Ever since I started going out with Nanami-san, I&#8217;ve been alienated from my classmates. The only person I can talk to now is Shibetsu Senpai.</p>



<p>Ah, come to think of it, I remember promising Senpai that I would ask Nanami-san to cook for him as a thank you for the clothes. However, he helped me with this too….I&#8217;ll make good on my promise another time.</p>



<p>After that, Nanami-san started grilling the dumplings one after another after she had finished preparing them.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I was idle, so I helped prepare the plates, clean the table and…helped with the other household chores that I don&#8217;t usually do.</p>



<p>……This really feels we&#8217;re a married couple.</p>



<p>While I was preparing the table, they were finished.</p>



<p>(Pan-friend dumplings, nicely fried and crispy on the edges.)</p>



<p>The colour of the dumplings was beautifully browned, with its aroma drifting through the air.</p>



<p>In addition, wakame, vermicelli soup, vegetable salad…and plenty of grated daikons?</p>



<p>&#8220;When we eat dumplings, we put grated daikon in the sauce. It makes it more refreshing and easier to eat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really, I&#8217;ve never done that before.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the rice was served, we sat down facing one another.</p>



<p>…Sitting face to face with each other really makes me feel relentless inside, yet it really makes me feel like we&#8217;re a married couple.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m starting to feel a little shy now.</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Then..I&#8217;ll start eating.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Bon appétit.&#8221;</p>



<p>To have this kind of exchange outside of lunch…I never would&#8217;ve expected it. Nanami-san seems to think so too, her cheeks redding slightly.</p>



<p>The food Nanami-san cooked was as delicious as always…and we laughed as we ate.</p>



<p>It was my first experience being immersed in a happy mood at dinner without my parents.</p>



<p>I felt like crying, but I managed to hold it in.</p>



<p>But it was bad enough when she went out of her way to get up from her seat to serve me more rice when I tried to do it myself.</p>



<p>I wanted to cry, but I also wanted to hug her from behind. I managed to restrain myself, though. Really, her backside looked so attractive.</p>



<p>And then, after finishing my dinner…I, who had never even washed dishes before as far as I was concerned, cleaned up the mess together with Nanami-san, who taught me how to do it. I never knew cleaning up could be so much fun……</p>



<p>The fun time went by in an instant, and before I knew it, it was time to go home.</p>



<p>I felt reluctant, but there was no other way.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san, I&#8217;ll walk you home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to. I&#8217;ll be fine on my own.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After what happened yesterday, I&#8217;m worried about you. Besides, I can&#8217;t let a girl walk home alone at night.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t think I would have to send her home from my place…….But I was so worried about Nanami-san going home alone at night. If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s better to go with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Then, I&#8217;ll take your word for it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps remembering what happened yesterday, she accepted my proposal with little apprehension. I wrapped and carried the dumplings(gifts), not forgetting anything…making sure there was no trace of her left at home.</p>



<p>This way, when my parents come home tomorrow, they shouldn&#8217;t be able to find out. Well, there&#8217;s no harm in being found out…it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s somewhat embarrassing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taking her extended hand in mine, I walked Nanami-san home.</p>



<p>Naturally, I brought the dumplings as a gift. As I am growing day by day, I am able to be considerate to that extent.</p>



<p>Along the way, we talked about the fun we had today, where to go next, and whether I would want Nanami-san to teach me how to cook……Anyway, there was no shortage of topics to talk about.</p>



<p>On those grounds, we reached Nanami-san&#8217;s house in no time. I still felt reluctant to part, but I&#8217;ll take it as a good thing since I accomplished my goal.</p>



<p>Near Nanami&#8217;s house, the place where we met in the morning was completely dark, but her house was just a stone&#8217;s throw away. We should be safe here.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san, see you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Youshin…thank you for today. I had a lot of fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah…me too.&#8221;</p>



<p>We both exchanged smiles, and just as I was about to say I had a good time too….a very large man suddenly appeared behind Nanami-san.</p>



<p>He had a stature similar to, if not over, Shibetsu Senpai…so much so that you can even see his muscles bulging out of his shirt, and he had a thicker body than Senpai.</p>



<p>With this person&#8217;s sudden arrival, I hurriedly stood in front of Nanami-san and turned my back on her. At first glance, his face looks angry and considerably angry.</p>



<p>I have a one in a million chance…no, I don&#8217;t even stand a chance against someone like this. The least I could do was prepare to buy some time for Nanam-san to get into the house.</p>



<p>The big man opened his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami…who&#8217;s the boy over there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;D-Dad…why?&#8221;</p>



<p>Dad.</p>



<p>Dad……?</p>



<p>Dad!?</p>



<p>I looked back at Nanami-san and then at the person who was referred to by &#8220;Dad.&#8221;</p>



<p>..I&#8217;m sorry, but they don&#8217;t look alike at all.</p>



<p>After that, the person in question…showed me a menacing smile.</p>



<p>……Apparently, my day isn&#8217;t over yet.</p>
