<h3>Interlude - Her First Date.</h3>


<p>The long-awaited Sunday date.</p>



<p>As far as I was concerned, this was the very first time I dated a boy in my life…I was awfully happy when I heard this was Youshin&#8217;s first date too.</p>



<p>It was the first time for both of us.</p>



<p>Yesterday&#8217;s romantic film was a little indecent. As I was reminiscing about such a scene, giggling and chattering with Hatsumi and Ayumi, I sent a message to Youshin.</p>



<p>I hadn&#8217;t even kissed him, yet the message I sent him showed hints of me desiring to tease him, but he hit back, saying 『I&#8217;m looking forward to it』, which left me fuming.</p>



<p>It was a little unpleasant, but to meet Youshin because of such an event, rather I feel like it&#8217;s more of a plus than anything.</p>



<p>Since I got to see the unexpected side of Youshin.</p>



<p>Hatsumi also praised Youshin, saying, 『It&#8217;s hard to imagine such a guy coming to our rescue, especially when he&#8217;s so quiet in class.』It was rare for her to praise a boy in our grade.</p>



<p>Ayumi also chipped in, saying 『To realize that was Nanami-san, when she wasn&#8217;t dressed like a gyaru, that&#8217;s amazing.』</p>



<p>I was very happy about that too.</p>



<p>Well, I was in a daze just now and didn&#8217;t hear about the reward, I was told the details later…… I was really looking forward to today&#8217;s date, hoping it would be a fun one.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I was thinking, but no, I enjoyed what I enjoyed…however, I never thought I would say such a thing.</p>



<p>Asking to go to Youshin&#8217;s house to prepare dinner for him, I surprised even myself. I said it! I can&#8217;t believe I said it! My mouth moved on its own accord, and I only noticed it after.</p>



<p>I was worried about his eating habits, but also because this was my long-awaited chance to get him to eat something other than my lunch. I was desperate not to miss that chance.</p>



<p>Moreover, I didn&#8217;t want Youshin to have a lonely dinner after our date. Since we went through the trouble of going on a date, I wanted it to end happily. If I could contribute to that, I would be even happier.</p>



<p>Besides, I wanted to spend a little more time with him. Well, after proposing the idea, I was made aware that his parents weren&#8217;t at home, and I became even more nervous, knowing that it was just going to be the two of us.</p>



<p>I frantically tried to cover up my nervousness.</p>



<p>He…wouldn&#8217;t do anything weird, would he…if it was Youshin? Ah, but…if it&#8217;s just a kiss on the cheek or something, then…no, but still…but… Such a conflict was born within me.</p>



<p>As it turns out, nothing weird happened. But I had a lot of fun until the very end, and I was thinking a little about this was what it means to be a newlywed.</p>



<p>I was happy that Youshin was helping me prepare the meal. I also found it cute that he was so absorbed in my cooking.</p>



<p>It tasted different from the food I usually ate with my family or the bento we ate together on the rooftop. We cooked together, ate together, and talked a lot about our dates together.</p>



<p>I was a bit surprised when Youshin tried to serve himself more rice after emptying his bowl in an instant. At home, it was normal for the mother to do this for us, and the father basically had the mother serve him another portion.</p>



<p>Seeing something like that made me wonder if he usually eats dinner alone more often than not, making me feel a little sad, and I stopped Youshin so that I could do it for him.</p>



<p>Youshin, who had just been served rice, was surprised. It may not mean much, but I still wanted to do it, even if it was for my own satisfaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;How much rice would you like?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, um…a little more, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt happy even with such a short exchange, and after thinking that this is what newlyweds are like…I was surprised when I realized that the current exchange between us was the same as that between my father and mother.</p>



<p>We haven&#8217;t even kissed yet, and we&#8217;ve already reached that level? I thought. I wonder if Youshin had noticed that my face broke into a grin.</p>



<p>And so, the fun times flew by in an instant, and when Youshin sent me home…I got the biggest shock of the day.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san…who is that boy over there?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was parting from Youshin, I heard a voice that I usually heard around the house behind me. At that moment, Youshin revealed his surprise and got on his guard. And although he may not be aware of it, I was glad that he moved to protect me.</p>



<p>But…why, why is father here? Ah, Youshin is surprised… Yes, this person is my father…</p>
