<h3>Interlude - The girl from now on.</h3>


<p>&#8220;Youshin. See you tomorrow!!&#8221;</p>



<p>I went through great pains to talk to Youshin, yet I hung up the call without waiting for his reply. Ah, come on! I wanted to talk to him a little longer, but it&#8217;s all my mother&#8217;s fault!</p>



<p>But, just as I&#8217;d expect, having Youshin participate in a talk about love together with my parents is just, way too embarrassing. Ah god, just kill me already…! Up till now, my face was bright red with shame.</p>



<p>I should…at least send a message.</p>



<p>Thank you for today. It was fun. If you want, we can go out on another date next week.</p>



<p>Youshin was the one who invited me today, but I implicitly included the invite for next week&#8217;s date. Next time, I want to be the one who plans the date. Like I thought, this was the first time I thought about such a thing.</p>



<p>The reply from Youshin was a good night greeting, along with a reply saying see you tomorrow. That was enough to make my face break into tears.</p>



<p>In reality, I wanted to say good night to Youshin directly. I cast a resentful glare toward the two people behind me.</p>



<p>How did this happen?</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder. Right now, I have two powerful enemies in front of me.</p>



<p>That is, my mother, Barato Tomoko, and my sister, Barato Saya. Neither of them seemed to care that my call was being interrupted as they both drank their tea. Damn it.</p>



<p>Right after Youshin went home, my mother, who was in high spirits, dragged me along with her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, shall we talk about my daughter&#8217;s love interest? Your mother&#8217;s dream has finally come true! Let&#8217;s hear all about it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Once this happens, there&#8217;s no way my mother would stop, and there&#8217;s no way you can stop her either. I had no choice but to give up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom…I&#8217;ve got the idea, so could you take your hands off my armpits. And……don&#8217;t ask too many embarrassing questions, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah~…did you perhaps do something so embarrassing that you can&#8217;t let your mother hear about it…hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>I blushed at that question from my mom, who suggestively smiled at me. No, I didn&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t done anything embarrassing!</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, it&#8217;s not an issue if I hear about it, right? Go on, let me hear everything through and through.&#8221;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t read my mind! How do you know? You didn&#8217;t……do anything….. embarrassing, did you……me? In the midst of feeling a little insecure, I started to talk about my love life with my mom.</p>



<p>First of all, my mom asked me to dig down to the root of how I felt when he hugged me. At that time, my inner thoughts were in their utmost state of panic.</p>



<p>Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-Y-YOUSHIN?! In front of my father and mother!? A-Aren&#8217;t you being a little too bold!? What should I do? Such were the thoughts that occupied my head at the time.</p>



<p>However, although Youshin&#8217;s body was slightly firm…I somehow felt awfully composed…feeling great relief, even wondering if I should hug him back and the like.</p>



<p>I was very happy that Youshin accepted my father&#8217;s condition while I was hugging him back…and that&#8217;s when my father&#8217;s words froze me.</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t remember! What do you mean by you don&#8217;t remember!? Pay me back for all the conflict you caused me. And finally, I was most disappointed that I couldn&#8217;t hug him back…after saying all that, I noticed my mom grinning right before my eyes.</p>



<p>Before long, with all the half teasing and banter while I was smiling and talking, I blushed with embarrassment at my own carelessness and shame.</p>



<p>And then, just as we finished talking, Isago joined in. Was it good timing or bad…no, it&#8217;s bad.</p>



<p>Isago, for instance, had retreated to her room when Youshin was there. However, she had come out of her room just in time to have a full-blown girls&#8217; talk with my mother.</p>



<p>I bet she just wanted to shut herself in the room there until Youshin was gone…sure enough, Isago had invited my mum out to have a girls&#8217; talk with her. Isago had a keen interest in it too, so I was sure she would join in…before long.</p>



<p>Thus, a girls&#8217; only gathering was held at our house. The host was my mother, the star was me, and the audience was Isago. It was late at night, and since I would get fat…tea was allowed, but no sweets. As if the both of them were telling me that the cake and sweets were my stories.</p>



<p>The next topic of conversation was when Youshin came to hold my hand.</p>



<p>Thinking that Youshin came to hold my hand differently, even going as far as telling my mother and father…that from now on till the future…we&#8217;ll always be together…as if he was proposing to them.</p>



<p>Both dad and mom widened their eyes. Right, this is a proposal, right? I can think so, right?</p>



<p>I felt anxious hearing all about the olden days that I didn&#8217;t remember, but my worries went away all at once. There was nothing but happiness in my heart.</p>



<p>…A proposal, huh…but marrying suddenly after graduation, isn&#8217;t that just too soon…to begin with, our relationship is going pretty smoothly…but what happens when we advance on to college…will we…w-will we start living together? I-I wonder if it&#8217;ll happen?</p>



<p>B-But, if that&#8217;s the case, what kind of house should we get? Something like an apartment? Even a small house would be fine if it&#8217;s just the two of us, but then wouldn&#8217;t we have to cuddle close together every night…? Hee-hee, such fantasies continued, causing the two people in front of me to grin.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t stop after talking about today&#8217;s story. Then, they started asking me about what I had done with Youshin before receiving that phone call.</p>



<p>It was just like an interview. Generally speaking, they were asking me various questions. No, well, it was fairly fun boasting about Youshin, but.</p>



<p>I found myself talking about the time he saved me, how we went shopping for lunch boxes together, and how he protected me against Senpai. Anyway, I found myself talking about the many things I liked about Youshin.</p>



<p>On the contrary, the thing I was dissatisfied with…was how he kept calling me 『Nanami-san』, like why? That was really about it.</p>



<p>I think it&#8217;s a high hurdle for a boy like Youshin…but I still want him to call me by my name.</p>



<p>A nickname…might be nice? But, wouldn&#8217;t that make us like somewhat like a sickeningly sweet and soppy couple?</p>



<p>I deviated from the topic, but…I did speak about everything I liked about Youshin. On the contrary, that was all I said.</p>



<p>I left out the important stuff.</p>



<p>There was no way I could talk about that. The fact that I confessed my feelings in a punishment game, that&#8217;s just…</p>



<p>That was the reason why I couldn&#8217;t tell my family that Youshin and I were dating. However, my mother didn&#8217;t ask how Youshin and I began dating, which was unnatural.</p>



<p>Anyway, I talked about the things I liked about Youshin, how I thought he was cool……and what I wanted to do from this point on.</p>



<p>It was a little embarrassing, but…I kept blabbering on and on about the good qualities of Youshin. And every time I did, Isago would start squealing out loud. Didn&#8217;t you say he looked lacklustre…</p>



<p>And then, when she said [Ah~, I want a boyfriend like that], I nailed her, telling her that I would never give Youshin to her, but she paused for a moment and gave me a dumbfounded look.</p>



<p>[…Onee-chan, just how much do you love Youshin? I just said I wanted a kind boyfriend like that. I never said anything about wanting to go out with Youshin, did I?]</p>



<p>My younger sister defeated me with a sound argument. Is this what it means to talk down to someone? W-Wait, now that I think about it…aah, god! Isn&#8217;t what I just said super embarrassing!! Enough, that&#8217;s enough!! We&#8217;re done!!</p>



<p>[I-I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m going to go take a bath and go to bed!!]</p>



<p>At the exact time when I got angry and stood up, dad came home. My mom headed towards the entrance to welcome dad home.</p>



<p>After seeing her off, I went to bathe as I declared. I would later message Hatsumi and Ayumi about the results of the date. It was a great success, I sent.</p>



<p>With my mother gone, Isago, perhaps satisfied with teasing me, waves her hand at me as she sees me off to the bath.</p>



<p>Good grief, she&#8217;s so selfish, I sighed. I then moved to the bath with the joy of being set free…when my mother suddenly peeked her face in and said something strange.</p>



<p>[Nanami…I&#8217;ll be going to your room later…we&#8217;ll be having a little chat, okay?]</p>



<p>[Y-Yes, okay.]</p>



<p>My mom wants to talk with me alone…?</p>



<p>Whenever I, my father or Isago have any problems, we&#8217;ll talk with my mom alone. It&#8217;s almost become a routine to discuss our troubles this way.</p>



<p>But…hearing that from my mom is especially rare.</p>



<p>I took a bath and changed into my pajamas…I told Hatsumi and Ayumi that today&#8217;s date was a great success, and I thanked and apologized to Hatsumi profusely, as I said to her that the date plan was useless.</p>



<p>While I was doing this, a knock came on my door. It was my mom.</p>



<p>[Nanami…may I come in?]</p>



<p>[Yes, it&#8217;s fine. Please come in.]</p>



<p>My mom was just out of the bath when she entered the room. How do I say…my mom looks really beautiful…maybe sexy even.</p>



<p>Even I, a woman, thought about it. She was my ideal image.</p>



<p>I hope to be this kind of mother in the future, but the other party is…No, let&#8217;s not think about it now.</p>



<p>I was getting red in the face and couldn&#8217;t speak to mom.</p>



<p>My mom was sitting on my bed in her pyjamas. Yes, she was just out of the bath, so she still looked very sexy.</p>



<p>I sat next to my mom…this was how we consulted each other in our family.</p>



<p>[Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s unusual? Your mother asked you to go into your room so she could talk to you alone?]</p>



<p>[Yes, that&#8217;s true.]</p>



<p>My mom flashed me a slightly troubled smile. Such an expression…it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve seen it. When was the last time I saw it?</p>



<p>[Nanami…let&#8217;s get straight to the point. Which one of you confessed first? Was it Nanami? Or Youshin?]</p>



<p>My mom suddenly questioned me. It was the unnatural thing she didn&#8217;t ask me about a short while ago…on whether it was Youshin or me who confessed first.</p>



<p>I just got out of the bath, and hearing that…my body temperature dropped down all the way in one go, my body growing cold. Why would mom want to hear such a thing at this point?</p>



<p>[N-No…uhm…it was me…I was the one…however…]</p>



<p>I told the truth as if squeezing it out of my voice. I can&#8217;t lie to my mom. I can&#8217;t lie.</p>



<p>And even if I did lie to my mom, with all my slight body gestures…she&#8217;d probably see through me all the way with her unique woman&#8217;s intuition. She says she hasn&#8217;t raised us well enough, but she&#8217;s just too good.</p>



<p>[Ara ara…now isn&#8217;t that strange? The things I heard from Nanami earlier about what she likes about Youshin…were all things that happened only after you started dating…so why would Nanami be the one confessing her feelings to Youshin?]</p>



<p>My heart beats loudly.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s…a punishment game…I just can&#8217;t say it.</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t say it? Why can&#8217;t I say it? That&#8217;s…is it because I&#8217;m afraid my mom will come to dislike me…? No, it&#8217;s different…the number one person I&#8217;m most afraid of coming to hate me now is…</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t think straight…my body, which grew cold, was suddenly enveloped in a warm sensation. It was incredibly soft and comfortable…and it smelled reassuringly good… And just from the touch, my cold body gradually grew warm.</p>



<p>My mom was holding……me in her arms.</p>



<p>[Nanami……when you said your father was lying earlier, you were thinking about a……different lie, not today&#8217;s lie……right?]</p>



<p>[…H-How…did…you know…?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m your mother, so of course, I know. And I know that Nanami is suffering because of it. Hey, what are you keeping a secret? I&#8217;m on Nanami&#8217;s side no matter what……so why don&#8217;t you tell me?]</p>



<p>Hearing those words…tears began welling up in my eyes.</p>



<p>The black feelings I&#8217;ve been bottling up in my heart until now…lying to Youshin, deceiving him, moreover, using every effort to turn his heart towards me, made me put a lid on my heart out of guilt.</p>



<p>I was laughing and reporting to Hatsumi and Ayumi about my everyday fun…having a good time together with them, laughing…what an ugly heart.</p>



<p>It blew up all at once.</p>



<p>[Y-You know… mom…I-I…to Youshin…I-I&#8217;ve been doing horrible things to him…I…I-I…punishment game…I-I confessed to Youshin in a punishment game…I…I really am the worst…]</p>



<p>[…So that&#8217;s what it was…that&#8217;s why you only started talking about the things you liked after dating him…]</p>



<p>[Y-Yes…yes…that&#8217;s right…I-I…I…I…waaaaaaaaaaah……]</p>



<p>The tears couldn&#8217;t stop overflowing, and I buried my face in my mom&#8217;s chest, wetting her pyjamas.</p>



<p>Even so, my mom continued to hug me close. I just couldn&#8217;t stop crying, voicing out my regrets…my mom silently listening.</p>



<p>As it was, I…realized the ugliness I had in my heart and my feelings towards Youshin…and I continued to cry.</p>



<p>[Hey, Nanami. Towards Youshin, the you right now…loves him a lot, right?]</p>



<p>When my tears settled down a little, my mother gently rubbed my back while admonishing that fact. Those words, fell with a heavy thump on my heart.</p>



<p>[Y-Yes…Yes…I-I love him…I love him…I love him lots…I-I&#8217;d hate it if it wasn&#8217;t Youshin…]</p>



<p>For the first time…without anything calculated, I said that I loved Youshin.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve never admitted it until now…I stayed annoyingly stubborn, saying I&#8217;m not easy this, I&#8217;m not that simple, and never even thought of saying those words out loud…but now, I finally managed.</p>



<p>[And what kind of things do you like about him?]</p>



<p>[W-Well, for starters, Youshin&#8217;s really kind…he worries about me even if he&#8217;s wounded…moreover, when I was dressed differently from school, out of my gal clothes, he was still able to recognize me…And he also complimented me on how cute I was…]</p>



<p>[Yes, yes. Good boy…he&#8217;s a really good boy.]</p>



<p>[He always gives me the words I want, holds my hands when I&#8217;m anxious, and hugs me…I feel at peace just being together with him…and it&#8217;s fun…]</p>



<p>[Yes… Yes…]</p>



<p>[He&#8217;s different from any of the boys I&#8217;ve met in the past… Hard to deal with, scary or dislikable…Youshin&#8217;s none of those things in the slightest…a-at this point…I won&#8217;t like it unless it&#8217;s him…]</p>



<p>I was hugged by my mom as it was.</p>



<p>All of it, I let it all out..my tears couldn&#8217;t stop flowing. When my crying subsided a little, after vomiting everything out…my mom unexpectedly separated from me.</p>



<p>[Yes, that&#8217;s enough whining for the day! Nanami, let&#8217;s do our best tomorrow so that Youshin can like you even more!]</p>



<p>After separating from me, my mom clapped both her hands and returned to her usual cheerful smile. I stared at her with my face still in disarray from all the crying, looking mentally befuddled.</p>



<p>[Mom, aren&#8217;t you mad at me?]</p>



<p>[Ah well~…I&#8217;ll bring it up again when Nanami, Hatsumi-chan and Ayumi-chan are all here. And why should I get mad when it&#8217;s an action that thinks about Nanami?]</p>



<p>Those words sent a slight chill down my spine.</p>



<p>She says that…but I could feel formidable anger radiating from my mom. I apologized to Hatsumi and Ayumi in my mind. I&#8217;ll be scolded together with you too, so please forgive me…</p>



<p>[Also, Nanami…I don&#8217;t care whatever the trigger was. Even if it was just a punishment game, you came to love Youshin…and Youshin seems to absolutely love Nanami too…I&#8217;m rooting for you both.]</p>



<p>[Mom…]</p>



<p>Encouraged by my mother, I…decided to quit fooling myself. I really love Youshin lots.</p>



<p>I want to be with him all the way. It&#8217;s okay to be easy. I won&#8217;t lie about my feelings anymore.</p>



<p>[But, don&#8217;t you have to make up for it…?]</p>



<p>My mom placed her index finger to her lips, her face revealing a bewitching smile. It was a chilling expression. It was the very first time I&#8217;d seen her like this…my mom&#8217;s face looking like that.</p>



<p>Make up for it…?</p>



<p>My mom pointed her index finger at me and told me as though she was commanding me.</p>



<p>[On your one-month anniversary…Nanami, you must be honest about everything and apologize to Youshin-kun. In addition, you have to leave it up to him as to what he wants to do afterwards.]</p>



<p>My body stiffened at the declaration from my mom.</p>



<p>My actions so far have been meant to prevent him from finding out the truth about the punishment game. However, not from now on.</p>



<p>No matter what action I take……I must finally tell him the truth.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m terribly scared…scared but…</p>



<p>[Yes…I understand, mom. On our one-month anniversary…I&#8217;ll tell Youshin everything…and apologize. And then, once again…I&#8217;ll confess. This time, without any lies. I&#8217;ll confess to Youshin that I love him.]</p>



<p>As if telling myself, I said these words of determination. Looking at my reaction, my mother laughed happily. And then…</p>



<p>[From now on, until you&#8217;re one-month anniversary, you&#8217;re going to be serving Youshin daily.]</p>



<p>[I-Isn&#8217;t there something wrong with the way you&#8217;re saying it!? D-Doesn&#8217;t it sound lewd!?]</p>



<p>She says that as if to poke fun at my resolution, then swiftly reverts back to her usual mother persona. I really can&#8217;t keep up with her pace.</p>



<p>….S…..Se….Serve… What the hell was she thinking!? Just thinking about it makes my cheeks grow hot.</p>



<p>But…for our one-month anniversary…what mom said…</p>



<p>[M-Mom, do I have to apologize right away…?]</p>



<p>[Are you still scared, Nanami? Well, in my view, I don&#8217;t really see how it&#8217;s a problem, but…that&#8217;s not to say it isn&#8217;t easy to prepare your heart… Slowly, slowly prepare…make youshin fall more and more in love with you.]</p>



<p>Mom…as she said from the beginning, she was on my side.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;ll become the enemy of Youshin. Mom seemed to be on the side of both me and Youshin.</p>



<p>[Besides, it&#8217;s often said that in love, the one who falls in love loses, right? Then, ultimately…if you both fall in love with each other, you&#8217;re both winners and lovers, don&#8217;t you agree? Just like your father and I.]</p>



<p>…My mom spoke fondly of that moment.</p>



<p>But those few words made me think…I and Youshin, our relationship will one day become something like mom and dad…that&#8217;s when I realized it was still too early to be thinking about marriage, and my cheeks turned red.</p>



<p>[Ara Ara, did you envision your married life with Youshin? Fufu, even if I did say service…isn&#8217;t there a scope of what you can do being a senior high school student?]</p>



<p>With her words that saw through me completely…once again, I realized that I was truly no match for my mother.</p>



<p>[Youshin…from tomorrow onwards…I&#8217;ll be going all out once again!]</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6wT4Xb3/p321-1.jpg"></img>



<p>Wiping away my tears, I muttered those words, which only my mother could hear, but…somehow, I had a feeling that my words had reached Youshin as well.</p>



<p>[Ara Ara, Nanami has a lover. You&#8217;re so hasty aren&#8217;t you?]</p>



<p>[Like I said, how did you know what I was thinking!?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m your mother, so of course, I know. Well then, I wonder if I should head towards my loved one. Good night.]</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but blush as I watched my mother go to my father with those words.</p>
