<h3>Chapter 4.5 - Us on a Date.</h3>


<p>After we finished watching the movie and discussed our impressions at the coffee shop, we strolled around the shopping mall, hand in hand.</p>



<p>Come to think of it. It&#8217;s almost lunchtime. What should I eat? If I remember correctly, Nanami-san said she ate a hamburger yesterday. Reporting it to me with a photo.</p>



<p>[Nanami-san, what do you want to eat for lunch?]</p>



<p>Nanami-san&#8217;s usually the one asking me that question. I never thought there would come a time when I would be the one to say this, though an outside lunch and bento box request is different.</p>



<p>[Lunch? Lunch, huh…]</p>



<p>[You ate a hamburger yesterday, right? You sent it to me via photo.]</p>



<p>[Yes. It&#8217;s been a long time since I ate it, but it was delicious. What did Youshin eat yesterday?]</p>



<p>[…C-Cup noodles.]</p>



<p>Although I wasn&#8217;t doing anything particularly wrong, a mysterious sense of guilt or inferiority welled within me, causing me to instinctively look away as I told her about yesterday&#8217;s lunch, though Nanami-san seemed unfazed.</p>



<p>[Is that why you didn&#8217;t tell me what you ate for lunch yesterday? I wonder, do boys like them? My dad frequently tries to eat them in secret, and my mom scolds him for it.]</p>



<p>I felt a sense of kinship gush out towards Nanami-san&#8217;s father, whom I have not met yet. Yes, I like cup noodles and eat them often, but every time I did, my mom would scold my dad and me.</p>



<p>I began to feel a mysterious sense of security in which all the families were the same in that area. Nanami-san&#8217;s father, I wonder what kind of person he is? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be a long time before I meet him.</p>



<p>By that time, I have to be careful not to be impolite. No, let&#8217;s put aside such future talk for the time being. Before anything else, today&#8217;s lunch.</p>



<p>[If you had hamburgers yesterday, how about spaghetti today? There&#8217;s a spaghetti restaurant nearby that looks rather tasty.]</p>



<p>[Pasta, huh? But aren&#8217;t pasta speciality restaurants rather expensive? Let&#8217;s go to a cheaper place.]</p>



<p>[Hmm, but I want to thank you for everything you&#8217;ve done for me so far, so I&#8217;d like to repay you in a variety of ways.]</p>



<p>I felt strangely put off by the difference in her nonchalant expression at the mention of spaghetti, and when I tried to point it out……my cheeks were suddenly gently sandwiched between her hands.</p>



<p>[…N-Nanami-san?]</p>



<p>My cheeks grew hot from her sudden action as I tried my best to squeeze her name out of my mouth.</p>



<p>[U-Um, you know, Youshin? I really appreciate the fact that you want to thank me, but you don&#8217;t have to worry so much about it, okay?]</p>



<p>Even though there wasn&#8217;t much strength in her hands, I couldn&#8217;t look away from her eyes. Nanami-san lowered her eyebrows, gently smiling as if she were persuading a child. However, that smile seemed just a little sad.</p>



<p>Perhaps, there are various conflicts within her.</p>



<p>[Well, Nanami-san wants to have an equal relationship with me, right? If that&#8217;s the case, let me at least do this as thanks for the daily Bentos you make for me every day. Otherwise, I can&#8217;t think we&#8217;re equals.]</p>



<p>[Then, how about going somewhere a little cheaper? I know what restaurant Youshin&#8217;s talking about, but I also know that it costs more than 1,000 yen per person. It&#8217;s just way too expensive considering you&#8217;re going to treat a person.]</p>



<p>[Hmm, somewhere cheap… Then, what do you want to eat?]</p>



<p>In the end, it all just went back to the beginning question. Nanami-san is really shrewd in various ways. Not that she has anything to do with bad women or anything like that.</p>



<p>If Peach-san gets to know this area, then it may help solve her worry and misunderstandings.</p>



<p>Nanami-san received my words and took both her hands off my cheeks. I felt lonely as the warm, soft touch left me as she looked at me, brooding.</p>



<p>I thought I didn&#8217;t have to worry so much, but what Nanami returned to me was unexpected.</p>



<p>[I think I now understand a little better about how guys feel when a woman says &#8216;anything is fine.&#8217;]</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s that, isn&#8217;t &#8216;anything is fine&#8217; the most annoying thing?]</p>



<p>At this unexpected comment, I unintentionally made a wry smile as I talked back to Nanami-san. I was surprised at myself for saying something I would never have said before. Worried that Nanami-san might&#8217;ve been offended, I looked at her face.</p>



<p>However, Nanami-san did not look particularly displeased but rather looked up just a little and muttered in a troubled tone,</p>



<p>[Hmm…after all…]</p>



<p>I assumed that perhaps there were too many dishes she&#8217;d like to eat, that she couldn&#8217;t choose properly because I was trying too hard to please her or something along those lines…</p>



<p>But I was wrong.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sure that whatever I eat with Youshin will be delicious.]</p>



<p>She said, clasping her hands together, her cheeks a tint of red. Not expecting such a thing to leave her mouth, I was hit with an intense shock. By no means did I expect that the phrase [anything is fine] could turn into something so wonderful.</p>



<p>Those few words were like a critical hit that dealt a blow to my heart. Really, that shock felt as if someone had hit me hard on the head. No, it has to be an illusion.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s our first date, so why would Nanami-san say such a line?</p>



<p>[What&#8217;s wrong, Youshin?]</p>



<p>Without thinking, I slumped down on the spot and hid my face. My face felt so hot that I couldn&#8217;t look at her face properly.</p>



<p>[Nanami-san…you asked me before if I had ever dated a girl, right?]</p>



<p>[A-Ah, let me think. Yeah.]</p>



<p>[Then let me ask you this. Is this really your first date, Nanami-san? Somehow, the destructive power of your words is too great I feel like I&#8217;m in trouble. It&#8217;s bad for my heart.]</p>



<p>Somehow today has become a day when the person asking the question and the person being asked the question are the opposite of usual. She tilts her head and looks at me curiously.</p>



<p>[No, I&#8217;ve never been on a date before… Ah, but I guess it&#8217;s not my first time if you count going out with a girl as a date? But it&#8217;s totally my first time with a boy.]</p>



<p>[Even among girls, do you talk about how good everything tastes and how destructive it is?]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s delicious when it&#8217;s with friends…oh…]</p>



<p>Then Nanami-san understood the meaning of her own words, and her face turned red belatedly from mine. After a moment of silence, she puffed out her chest as if taking the offensive.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right! See! Meals taste better when you&#8217;re eating it with someone, not alone!]</p>



<p>With her face a deep red, she declares something like an excuse. As for me, the taste of meals is the same whether I eat it alone or with others…however.</p>



<p>[Yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right.]</p>



<p>I agree with that statement.</p>



<p>In this past week, I have learned how delicious it is when you&#8217;re eating with someone rather than eating alone. Nanami taught me that, even though it was a punishment game.</p>



<p>[Jeez, you&#8217;re smiling like some grown-up. You&#8217;re making fun of me, aren&#8217;t you?]</p>



<p>[No, I&#8217;m not. It&#8217;s just a misunderstanding. If I&#8217;m together with Nanami-san, everything is delicious.]</p>



<p>Nanami-san&#8217;s mouth twitched as if she were a child when she heard my response. I do feel sorry for giving her a misunderstanding, but she&#8217;s just so adorable. I feel like I&#8217;ve seen her in many different states just today.</p>



<p>[Ah. I want to eat that. That!]</p>



<p>[That? What do you mean?]</p>



<p>Nanami-san held up her finger as if trying to dodge my question. Has she decided what she wants to eat? Whatever comes out of her mouth, I&#8217;m going to make it happen, but…what came out of her mouth was the name of an unexpected restaurant.</p>



<p>[Gyudon! I want to go to a Gyudon restaurant! I&#8217;ve never been there before!]</p>



<p>[Gyudon!?]</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t that the kind of place you shouldn&#8217;t take a girl on a date? I&#8217;ve seen some TV show saying something like that, right?</p>



<p>There was a story about how a boyfriend took his girlfriend to a Gyudon restaurant for their first date, and she thought it was ridiculous. Eh? But what if she said she wanted to eat it?</p>



<p>[G-Gyudon…there are even better things than that, b-but are you sure that&#8217;s what you want?]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ve never been there with the girls before, so I want to check it out. Perhaps, Youshin has never been there before?]</p>



<p>[No, I go to many restaurants since it&#8217;s just right for going out to eat alone.]</p>



<p>[T-Then, does this mean I&#8217;m the first one you&#8217;re eating out together with?]</p>



<p>I pondered for a bit. Certainly, now that she mentions it, this is the first time I&#8217;m going out together with someone to a Gyudon restaurant. No, on the contrary, isn&#8217;t this the first time I&#8217;m having a meal with someone outside?</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right, this is the first time I&#8217;m eating out together with someone. I mean, I&#8217;ve never been on a date before, so everything that happens today might be a first for me.]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s my first time going to a Gyudon restaurant too. So I&#8217;m glad that I can do it together with you for the first time.]</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m happy about that…but is it really okay? I mean, a Gyudon restaurant?]</p>



<p>[Yeah! I&#8217;ve been to a pasta restaurant before with Hatsumi and her friends. At any rate, let&#8217;s experience a lot of firsts today!]</p>



<p>After saying this, Nanami-san takes my hand in hers and begins walking. I was a little puzzled by the look of happiness on her face. Is this really something that can make one feel so happy? Well, so long as she&#8217;s happy, it&#8217;s okay.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s right, let&#8217;s have as much fun as possible.]</p>



<p>[Yes. Ah! I want to go to a ramen restaurant next time. I&#8217;ve never been to one before, so I hope you can find me a delicious-looking one.]</p>



<p>Nanami-san requested me to find her a meal for our following date. I wonder, does this mean that this isn&#8217;t my first and last date…and that Nanami-san will go out on another date with me?</p>



<p>Seeing her happy expression, I still wasn&#8217;t sure, but if there was a next time, I wouldn&#8217;t be as satisfied as I am. Next time, I want her to have more fun.</p>



<p>So I told her.</p>



<p>[Yes, I&#8217;ll look for a good restaurant. So…will you go on another date with me?]</p>



<p>[Of course. Youshin is my boyfriend, so I&#8217;ll be happy to do it.]</p>



<p>Would it be too doubting of me that to me she also sounded like telling those words to herself? Can I sincerely believe her words?</p>



<p>With these thoughts in mind, I decided to head to a beef bowl restaurant to have lunch while feeling the warmth of her hand.</p>



<p>Then, I made a decision in my mind. Next time, I would do my best to please her even more. That was the lunchtime event on our first date.</p>
