<h3>Prologue</h3>



<p>The day began and ended as usual, without incident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least it was supposed to be one of those days.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, do you want to go to karaoke? It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve sung.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? It&#8217;s still Monday, though?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on! I&#8217;ll show you my beautiful voice to blow away your Monday blues!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A group of young people, who seemed to be at the top of the school caste, were talking to a man and a woman who were close friends.</p>



<p>As I was getting ready to leave, I listened to their voices.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, come on, you guys. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve heard any anime songs.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was how they approached the otaku group in class in that manner…even calling out to the guys who looked like me, but actually not.</p>



<p>The boys who approached were acting kind of overblown and accepting of their invitation.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there was no such thing as bullying in our class.</p>



<p>At least, I don&#8217;t know of any.</p>



<p>There were different groups of people in the class who were close to one another. Although there were inevitably people who held a relatively strong position within the group, each group got along rather well.</p>



<p>The only exception would be me.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t belong to any particular group, and I rarely speak to my classmates. I don&#8217;t have any special friends either.</p>



<p>Even now, everyone seems to be oblivious to me as they go on about their karaoke plans.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Nanami. You guys are coming too, right? I can&#8217;t get excited if you three don&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the midst of all this, one of the boys made up his mind to call out to the three of them.</p>



<p>He stood out from the rest of the class.</p>



<p>His voice was a little slurred, indicating that he was a little nervous.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re not going this time. Nanami and I have some business to attend to. Have fun with everyone else.&#8221;</p>



<p>The boy&#8217;s question was a dull one, despite his determination. The black-haired girl looks back at him only once, and with a flutter of her hand, immediately declines.</p>



<p>&#8220;What the hell&#8230;..karaoke with everyone is more fun&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re that persistent&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>The black-haired girl gave the boy a powerful smile, forcing the boy who approached her to back away.</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Okay. I guess the three of you aren&#8217;t joining us this time, understood&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She nodded her head in satisfaction as the boy withdrew his words.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The girl called Nanami looked somewhat relieved behind her, or was that just my imagination?</p>



<p>All three of the girls looked like they were used to being with boys, and they had the revealing body of a gal.</p>



<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just my imagination.</p>



<p>Eh&#8230;wait&#8230;her name it&#8217;s&#8230;..Nanami right?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t remember where exactly, but I felt like I had heard that name before.</p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s none of my business, I thought as I left the classroom.</p>



<p>I could hear them talking about where the best karaoke place was in the classroom, but my mind was fixated on the game I was going to play when I got home.</p>



<p>There was only one difference between having friends in class and having friends outside of class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I could play games online with my online friends.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I prioritize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s was simply it.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why my classmates who were going to karaoke and the gals who said they had something to do soon faded from my mind.</p>



<p>I knew that they and I had nothing to do with each other and would never have anything to do with each other—especially those three eye-catching gals, who probably weren&#8217;t even interested in me.</p>



<p>Until this day, that&#8217;s what I thought.</p>



<p>I never imagined that these girls, who I thought were irrelevant, would be &#8230;&#8230; No, it was her.</p>



<p>I had no idea that I would become so deeply involved with her and that so many things would change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether this was a good thing or a bad thing, I still couldn&#8217;t know at this point.</p>
