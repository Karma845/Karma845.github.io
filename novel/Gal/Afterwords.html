<h3>Afterwords</h3>


<p>To those of you who have picked up this book, it is nice to meet you. I&#8217;m Kesseki. Read &#8220;Kesseki,&#8221; and not &#8220;Yuishi.&#8221;</p>



<p>As mentioned in the author&#8217;s profile at the beginning, I&#8217;m a person around 40 years old and will finally turn 40 next January.</p>



<p>I never thought that my book would be published in the last year of my thirties. I really am enjoying the challenge of making something new at my age.</p>



<p>I started posting this work on March 7, 2000, and completed the main story in May of the same year. After that, I updated the extra editions and so on.</p>



<p>And then, it was in March of this year that I received the call for the publication of the book, which I will never forget. In fact, it had been over a year since I received the offer.</p>



<p>My ranking on the site at that time was not a good one, and it was just out of the blue. I remember raising my fist in the air and screaming alone in my room.</p>



<p>I feel that it is thanks to those who supported me that I was able to publish this work, which had already been completed, as a book.</p>



<p>From then on, it was just a very chaotic time, but I enjoyed it very much.</p>



<p>I cannot thank Kobayashi Sensei of the HJ Bunko editorial department enough for finding this work. I feel that I will probably never be able to get my head around it because I have been exposed to various dispositions.</p>



<p>And Kagachi Sensei. Thank you very much for the wonderful illustrations. I may have put you through a lot of trouble because of me, who had not done any character design at all.</p>



<p>Whenever an illustration was delivered to me, I would grin and enjoy it by myself, enduring the thought of showing it to the world immediately.</p>



<p>When I announced that we were going to publish the book, those who had been supporting us for some time were as happy as if it were their own, and at the same time, their warm words brought tears to my eyes.</p>



<p>I think it had been a really long time since I had cried.</p>



<p>To everyone who has been involved in this publication in various ways, I hereby extend my thanks and apologies once again.</p>



<p>This book is based on the web version with a lot of additions. Did you enjoy it?</p>



<p>Well, I hope you did.</p>



<p>We ask that all readers, both those who know the ending and first-time readers, watch to see what happens to him and her in the future.</p>



<p>In fact, we have written several benefits, some of which you can read only at NovelUp+. If you like this work, please visit our website.</p>



<p>Also, some benefits were lost, for crying out loud, and I would like to publish those somewhere. I will look for a way to do that.</p>



<p>From Kesseki, who wrote so much text that she could hardly write an afterword, I would like to thank you all again for your support.</p>



<p>I hope to see you again in the next volume.</p>



<p>December 2021 Kesseki</p>
