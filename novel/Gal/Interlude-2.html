<h3>Interlude 2: Her change.</h3>



<p>『Good night, Nanami-san.』</p>



<p>Even now, I was still ruminating about Youshin&#8217;s words from earlier, and I could still hear them ringing in my ears. This wasn&#8217;t the first time I spoke to a boy, and I knew that I wasn&#8217;t very good at it, but despite that, talking with him kept me on the edge of my seat.</p>



<p>It felt as if Youshin was right next to my ear, and I thought what a great invention the telephone was, thanking the person who invented the telephone, whose face and name I didn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>….Now that I think about it, isn&#8217;t this the first time I&#8217;ve talked to a boy alone? Moreover, in a room at night like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, Yabai! T-This is too much!!&#8221;<br>[Tl notes: Yabai:]</p>



<p>I was lying face down on my bed, flapping my legs violently. It didn&#8217;t make any sense, but for some reason, there was a part of me that couldn&#8217;t relax unless I was moving in some way.</p>



<p>I-It&#8217;s no good…. I can&#8217;t seem to control my feelings somehow. I feel really restless. My head feels light, like the time when I had a fever.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess I can&#8217;t argue with Hatsumi and Ayumi after all…&#8221;</p>



<p>Today was filled with a series of unbelievable events.</p>



<p>When I arrived at the meeting place too early in the morning and was trying to figure out how to kill time, he came right up to me.</p>



<p>Despite his embarrassment, he noticed the changes in my hairstyle and said I looked cute. Because of that, I thought Youshin looked even cuter than before.</p>



<p>As soon as he told me I was cute, I instinctively suggested holding hands. Inwardly, I panicked, wondering why I was saying such a thing out of the blue, but it didn&#8217;t matter anymore when his hand touched mine.</p>



<p>While feeling the comforting warmth of Youshin&#8217;s hand in mine, I was very nervous as this was my first experience.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have sweaty hands or anything strange, did I?</p>



<p>I was really nervous when I invited Youshin out for lunch. Because of what Hatsumi told me, I was in a panic about what I would do if Youshin brought his lunch with him, but I was relieved to find out that he didn&#8217;t have his lunch with him.</p>



<p>Is there anything you don&#8217;t like?　</p>



<p>Would you be okay with something homemade?　</p>



<p>I thought of all the things I should have asked him afterwards, inviting him was a good idea, but I felt very nervous.</p>



<p>I also got poked on the cheek, ate lunch together, and somehow ended up doing the &#8220;Ahhh&#8221; thing.</p>



<p>Why did I do the &#8220;Ahhh&#8221; thing!?</p>



<p>But once I did it, I couldn&#8217;t withdraw.</p>



<p>Please eat it, I beg you! Come on, eat up! The stares of the people around me hurt, and I&#8217;m embarrassed to be doing this to myself!! I was in a hurry.</p>



<p>I was so relieved when he ate it that I continued with my lunch…….</p>



<p>On second thought, isn&#8217;t that an indirect kiss?</p>



<p>Uwa, I just noticed this…and now I&#8217;m starting to feel embarrassed. I curl up on the bed, holding both my hot cheeks.</p>



<p>I had an…indirect kiss with Youshin…</p>



<p>No, I can&#8217;t, that kind of thing; if someone said that to me, I&#8217;d probably die of embarrassment. Youshin would never say that kind of thing to me, too, I think.</p>



<p>In the first place, was Youshin even aware of this? That this was an indirect kiss?</p>



<p>At the end of the day, after school, we even went out for a shopping date.</p>



<p>Wait, is it a shopping date or a first date?</p>



<p>Not exactly, is it?</p>



<p>All of this was a first for me.</p>



<p>Well, it comes as no surprise since this was the first time I&#8217;ve had a boyfriend…….</p>



<p>Although he was the &#8216;boyfriend&#8217; who I confessed to in a punishment game…I had a lot of fun whenever I was with Youshin.</p>



<p>…I-I wanted to spend more time with him.</p>



<p>But I can&#8217;t help but feel guilty about that in the end.</p>



<p>Even so…I glanced at Youshin&#8217;s lunchbox that I kept secretly in the room.</p>



<p>He bought it for me… it&#8217;s my prized possession.</p>



<p>No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s quite the same as saying he bought it for me. Cause if you think about it, it&#8217;s emotionally understandable that he would buy it for himself…..I was just a little floaty and ecstatic that I didn&#8217;t realize it until I said it myself.</p>



<p>But even so, I still feel like I&#8217;ve gotten a gift from Youshin, and I still keep it in my room secretly instead of hiding it in the kitchen.</p>



<p>Every day, from now on, I will fill this lunch box with my home cooking and give it to him.</p>



<p>The mere thought of that just makes me so happy.</p>



<p>『Is that a loving wife&#8217;s bento?』</p>



<p>Immediately, the smiling faces of the grinning Hatsumi and Ayumi come to mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a loving wife yet!&#8221;</p>



<p>I got up from the bed with a jolt and excused myself to the two people who weren&#8217;t there.</p>



<p>Ugh….those two are so weird…..</p>



<p>Cooking is all about love, and it&#8217;s certainly true that you pour your love into it. Love is put into it, but… it&#8217;s like a mother&#8217;s love…. That kind of love…it must be…..</p>



<p>The more I thought about it, the hotter my cheeks got, and once again, I writhed on the bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, what&#8217;s going on? Nanami said that she was a little scared of boys, but now she was holding hands with one on the way to school…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so jealous～. I wish I could hold hands with my boyfriend on the way to school…but I can&#8217;t….&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what Hatsumi and Ayumi said to me this morning when they interrogated me about my situation.……but that&#8217;s not what I want to hear from you, Hatsumi.</p>



<p>Ayumi seemed to be envious of the fact that Youshin and I held hands on the way to school.</p>



<p>It was definitely just going to school, but….it was a lot of fun.</p>



<p>No, going to school with friends was fun, but this was a different kind of fun. Ayumi couldn&#8217;t do it herself, whereas I could…so she was jealous of me.</p>



<p>At any rate, I explained everything that had happened yesterday, including the fact that Youshin had helped me altogether.</p>



<p>They listened to me in silence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Really…so Youshin did that, huh….and then you fell in love with him right then and there, after Youshin saved you, am I right, Nanami? Umu….I see. Then our worries were truly right on the money, weren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami is so simple, really, really. But I guess I made the right choice by choosing Misumai. He&#8217;s unexpectedly dependable in times of need, and he&#8217;s a good match for Nanami.&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;re being pretty rude, calling me simple.</p>



<p>Despite this, I was so delighted when they praised Youshin that I continued to speak of him afterwards to the two of them.</p>



<p>Even though we&#8217;ve only been dating for two days…..</p>



<p>When I came to after talking too much, the two of them had a grin on their faces…..but there was a look of relief on their faces as they watched over me.</p>



<p>&#8220;T-This is just a normal love talk…. isn&#8217;t it? It was the first time the three of us had a girls talk together. It was fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>The three of us were chatting even before I contacted Youshin.</p>



<p>The three of us talked about love….I may have talked too much…however, they still listened to my words diligently.</p>



<p>And then, without hesitation, they gave me irresponsible advice about how I could go even further. Because it was impossible for me to go even further than I could right now!</p>



<p>Towards the end, I was told,</p>



<p>&#8220;Enough bragging about your sweetheart, go and contact him already&#8221;,</p>



<p>but was I really bragging that much?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a little embarrassed.</p>



<p>But actually, it took me a while to get in touch with Youshin.</p>



<p>For a long time, I stared at the phone, unable to muster the courage.<br>Should I…really contact Youshin?</p>



<p>Would it bother him?</p>



<p>Is he already asleep?</p>



<p>Thoughts like that ran through my head.</p>



<p>But I wanted to hear his voice…I wondered what I should do…In the end, I decided to leave Youshin with a message.</p>



<p>I think I&#8217;ve lost my mind.</p>



<p>Youshin called me himself, which made me happy.</p>



<p>Then I started talking to Youshin…and he asked me out on a date.</p>



<p>Although he was always quiet at school, I get overwhelmed when he comes on strongly….but I don&#8217;t particularly hate that. Unfortunately, I had a prior engagement on Saturday.</p>



<p>His panicked voice was cute, so I pretended to be relaxed on the surface, but secretly I was nervous and disappointed that we couldn&#8217;t have a date on Saturday.</p>



<p>However, he didn&#8217;t stop there. For some reason, he suddenly became respectful and asked me out again on Sunday. My answer was obvious.</p>



<p>But the truth was, I thought of asking him out on Sunday myself…but he beat me to it. That&#8217;s a little frustrating.</p>



<p>Even so, Youshin asked me out on a date.</p>



<p>And that fact made me very happy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy.</p>



<p>Why am I so happy?</p>



<p>Date….</p>



<p>If I excluded today&#8217;s after school shopping &#8216;date&#8217;, then Sunday would be my very first date…Sunday is my very first date…I can&#8217;t stop myself from feeling restless.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to put in a lot of effort for tomorrow&#8217;s bento. Oh, but I still have to make sure my mom doesn&#8217;t find out about it……&#8221;</p>



<p>At any rate, Youshin is sincere. So I don&#8217;t have to worry about him thanking me for the bento.</p>



<p>And I like it when Youshin praises me….</p>



<p>Like?</p>



<p>Like who?</p>



<p>No, I just like to cook, and this should simply be nothing more than practice…..at least, that&#8217;s what was supposed to be.</p>



<p>…..Even if I say so myself, I realized it was an unreasonable excuse.</p>



<p>In any case, I thought about tomorrow&#8217;s bento in order to discipline my irresistibly festive mind.</p>



<p>Youshin said that hamburgers would be good. I&#8217;ll cook him a huge one. Will it fit in his lunch box? Do you think he&#8217;d like an omelette? Come to think of it. I wonder which he likes better, sweet or sour…….Maybe I should have asked him what he liked today.</p>



<p>Should I make him some onigiri&#8217;s or….some heart-shaped Sakura denbu…or something?<br>[Tl notes: Sakura denbu refers to mashed, seasoned fish that is colored light pink with red food coloring. The pink color evokes the blossoms of Japanese cherry trees, called &#8220;sakura,&#8221; in Japanese. ]</p>



<p>……Yeah, I&#8217;m a little too embarrassed to make a heart shape, and I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll say if they find out, so I&#8217;ll just make…an onigiri.</p>



<p>He said he could eat anything with the exception of herbaceous foods, but I didn&#8217;t have enough time to ask him in detail about his preferences because of all the various things that were going on……</p>



<p>Tomorrow I want to talk about many more things. I want to know a lot more about Youshin, and I want him to know a lot more about me.</p>



<p>But when that time comes…</p>



<p>&#8220;One month…is short…&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I was muttering to myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to keep going out with him, but if you really like him, I guess you could keep going out with him, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what they said to me when they proposed this punishment game. In the beginning, I felt depressed about it, believing that I had to go out with him for a month.</p>



<p>It was bad enough for the him to begin with…because I wasn&#8217;t clear on what to do in the meantime.</p>



<p>But now it&#8217;s different. One month felt way too short. I&#8217;m surprised at how much my feelings can change in just one day.</p>



<p>I wanted to try Tapioca and drink it with Youshin. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s never had it before, so I&#8217;d like to teach him a few things.</p>



<p>I wanted him to eat more of my food. Not only my bento boxes but also my freshly cooked hot food. I wanted him to say,</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>….In that case…will I be going…to his house?</p>



<p>I get so nervous just thinking about it.</p>



<p>There are a lot of events in a relationship.</p>



<p>I think it would be fun to go to festivals together, and I want to go to the beach during summer vacation. Along with Halloween, Christmas and Valentines day…</p>



<p>What I want to do, what I want to do for him, what I want him to do for me…makes me feel that one month is truly short.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you guys going to kiss tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it yet! I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>



<p>I argue with Hatsumi and Ayumi as they come up in my mind once again.</p>



<p>Like that, I was screaming my lungs out while half-destroying my bed when Mom scolded me.</p>



<p>Calm down..calm down….</p>



<p>Youshin was calm, unlike me……..I thought he was quiet at school, but as a matter of fact, he seemed mature even.</p>



<p>He probably had no idea how nervous I was and how my heart was pounding wildly inside during the call.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, why was he being so respectful when he asked me out again? If he was truly as nervous as I was…wouldn&#8217;t he feel as happy as me?</p>



<p>One month later…what should I do?</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t imagine what would happen if Youshin found out about this and left me….just thinking about it makes me want to cry.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Am I really that easy?&#8221;</p>



<p>Questions that have no one to answer are directly digested into my mind.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not true… I&#8217;m not that easy…even now, I&#8217;m thinking only about Youshin, and I&#8217;m well aware that I couldn&#8217;t argue with what they both said.</p>



<p>So I decided to do one thing. I decided to follow their advice and……go for it.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make Youshin love me!! I&#8217;ll capture his stomach! I&#8217;ll play with him as much as possible! …. I&#8217;m still too embarrassed to kiss him, though! That way, he won&#8217;t leave me!&#8221;</p>



<p>I know I&#8217;m the worst.</p>



<p>Even if this started out as a punishment confession, I hope Youshin will somehow forgive me…so before that, I&#8217;ll make sure to grasp his heart completely.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll make Youshin fall in love with me all over again. ……This is the best I can do, as I still haven&#8217;t worked up the courage to confide in him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, it&#8217;s decided! I&#8217;ll make a bento for him tomorrow! Yeah, I&#8217;m going to put in all my effort into it!&#8221;</p>



<p>I rose up from bed and made a racket again, and my mum got mad at me.<br>Now that I have a plan, there&#8217;s no more hesitation on my part!</p>



<p>And then, I slipped into my bed and fell asleep.</p>



<p>Good night, Youshin…I hope you have a good dream.</p>



<p>No, wait. I hope you have a good dream? Maybe I&#8217;m just that easy after all…</p>
