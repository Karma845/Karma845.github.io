<h3>Interlude 1: Her feelings.</h3>



<p>Today, for the very first time in my life…I, Barato Nanami, will confess my feelings to a boy.</p>



<p>He was the quietest, inconspicuous, docile boy in our class. The three of us hardly talked to him, and I didn&#8217;t know him very well.</p>



<p>But I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s a kind and gentle boy, so I confessed to him.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t confess to him because I liked him.</p>



<p>This was a punishment game confession.</p>



<p>Yes, a punishment game. A punishment game where I had to confess my &#8216;feelings&#8217; to a boy and keep him company for a month. A punishment game that I had to play since I lost.</p>



<p>In the end, I decided to do it. To play with people&#8217;s hearts… that&#8217;s the worst….once again, I realized that fact.</p>



<p>It could have been anyone, so long as they were quiet.</p>



<p>It may sound like a thrill kill, but in fact, for him, it was like being attacked by a demon.</p>



<p>My only excuse was that I didn&#8217;t come up with this punishment game.</p>



<p>It was a game devised by my two friends, Otofuke Hatsumi and Ayumi Kamiechi. But there&#8217;s no point in making any excuses. I&#8217;m just as guilty as they were when I accepted it.</p>



<p>At first, I was reluctant at the idea of playing with people&#8217;s hearts…but eventually…I accepted it&#8230;the Bastu game.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m no fan of men even though I dress fancy and wear many revealing clothes.</p>



<p>The outfit itself was a kind of wall that protected my heart, which was offered to me by my two friends.</p>



<p>It was a very thin wall, but anyway…when I&#8217;m dressed like that, and I&#8217;m with the two of them, I can manage to talk to the boys in a normal way. I think some of us have even become friends.</p>



<p>But I can only do so when I&#8217;m with the two of them, not when I&#8217;m alone. I just couldn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>That was why they were so worried about me.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s all good for now, but I intend to go to college in the future. Hatsumi wants to pursue her dreams of being a hairdresser, and Ayumi wants to be a designer. Both of them were studying every day in order to enter a vocational school.</p>



<p>Our grades themselves weren&#8217;t that bad, though we tend to look like idiots. But we were studying hard for our dreams.</p>



<p>In the future, my path will certainly be different from both of them. That was why they were worried that I, without them, would fall for some strange guy at a…university.</p>



<p>They&#8217;re probably more worried than my own parents. Considering how they keep telling me that I shouldn&#8217;t fall for strange men.</p>



<p>I guess that&#8217;s why they proposed this punishment game. They wanted me to get used to being around boys as much as possible so that I wouldn&#8217;t be in any trouble in the future.</p>



<p>They likely judged the boy they chose for me to be &#8216;safe&#8217; from their eyes as well. Sure, I&#8217;ve never talked to Youshin before, but he&#8217;s always by himself, quiet and alone, and I&#8217;ve always felt that he seemed harmless too… With their encouragement, I decided to confess my feelings to him.</p>



<p>And today was the day I confessed my feelings to him.</p>



<p>I confessed to him for such selfish reasons, knowing it was the worst, but still following through since this was a chance for me to get used to boys.</p>



<p>…I really am the worst.</p>



<p>In spite of the fact that it was a punishment game confession, I felt very nervous and tense since it was my first time confessing.</p>



<p>The day before the confession, I was mumbling to myself all the time in bed 「Confess… I&#8217;m going to confess tomorrow…」so much so that it left me sleep-deprived.</p>



<p>I was so nervous on the day of the confession, but what surprised me more than my own nervousness was him.</p>



<p>The people who have confessed to me so far….the captain of the basketball club, kept staring at my breasts. The Yankee looking guy kept staring at my legs, and the studious-looking guy with glasses kept staring at my arms.</p>



<p>Everyone who has confessed to me so far looked somewhere at my body, not my face…as if they were expecting something.</p>



<p>But he wasn&#8217;t like that.</p>



<p>When I confessed to him, he looked straight into my eyes…and didn&#8217;t look at any other part of my body. He was only looking at my eyes. Seriously.</p>



<p>It gave me a different feeling other than nervousness, which was unlike any other person I&#8217;d met before.</p>



<p>But in the blink of an eye…after gathering the courage to confess to him…he started running towards me as soon as I began confessing.</p>



<p>In no time at all, he pushed me to the ground and covered me.</p>



<p>At the time, I was so surprised by his unexpected behaviour. Eh!? Thoughts started running through my head. Was I going to be attacked!? In the end, I just wanted to get it over with. And I can&#8217;t help but say…I was a little disappointed.</p>



<p>After all, he&#8217;s the same…as all the boy&#8217;s I&#8217;ve ever known, or is he less than that? I wondered if I was going to be violated by him…that I screamed, but my legs couldn&#8217;t move.</p>



<p>All I could do was close my eyes and scream, unable to put up any kind of resistance. But I soon realized that my recognition was a mistake.</p>



<p>Right after I was pushed down, the sound of water splashing on the ground and the sound of a gun hitting something hard somewhere echoed in my ears, and through his body came the impact on my body.</p>



<p>When I fearfully opened my eyes to see what had happened, there was Youshin, soaking wet with blood pouring from his head.</p>



<p>His blood soaked my cheeks…and then he turned to face me and smiled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay? Nanami-san…? You&#8217;re not hurt, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>The first thing he said to me after he was injured and soaking wet was that he was worried about me. And right after that, he collapsed.</p>



<p>I was confused and didn&#8217;t understand why. But I soon realized that he had covered me to protect me, and I became ashamed of placing my disappointment on him.</p>



<p>I almost panicked, thinking that he had died because of me, but I was relieved when I saw that he was breathing. Then I immediately ran. But It was impossible for me to carry him alone.</p>



<p>Running, my breath came in gasps, and my heart started to beat faster.</p>



<p>But I didn&#8217;t know at the time whether this heartbeat of mine was for Youshin or due to the fact that I was running.</p>



<p>The moment I arrived at the staff room, I immediately called for the teachers…to carry him to the infirmary. My heart was pounding all the time, and when I saw him close his eyes, I felt my chest tighten.</p>



<p>The nurse took off his wet clothes and laid him on the bed…I was so relieved when she told me that he would probably be okay, despite his head being cut. I almost cried.</p>



<p>Then, after all that, I saw his naked upper body and was even more thrilled to see him surprisingly well trained.</p>



<p>I had thought he was just a quiet, weak boy, but he wasn&#8217;t like that at all. He was surprisingly strong and tough, and despite realizing that he really was a boy, my dislike of boys… didn&#8217;t come up at all.</p>



<p>And I learned that he was gentler and kinder than any other boy I had ever met.</p>



<p>When he woke up and accepted my confession, I felt a strong sense of guilt as well as joy inside me. I was also surprised at how happy I was when he accepted my confession.</p>



<p>As if riding on that happiness, I suggested we call each other by our first names. I wanted Youshin to call me by my first name, even though I had always hated……being called by my first name by boys.</p>



<p>But that was all I could do. I couldn&#8217;t say anything more to him.</p>



<p>I was able to walk home with him, but I couldn&#8217;t talk to him, either because of my slowly growing guilt or because I was nervous about the situation we were in together.</p>



<p>Was it boring for you to go home with me? If so, I&#8217;m really sorry.</p>



<p>At the very end, we exchanged our contact information and talked a little, albeit awkwardly. I was rather absentminded because I was so excited.</p>



<p>I came home in a daze, went back to my room, and collapsed on my bed, recalling what had just happened.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was so cool…Youshin-kun…&#8221;</p>



<p>…Why am I so nervous? Why am I mumbling like this? Do I have the right to do this?</p>



<p>I…flailed around in bed as I thought about going out with Youshin-kun. There was absolutely no discomfort in my heart when I thought about dating such a boy.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, from tomorrow onwards, I will be acting as Youshin-kun&#8217;s…girlfriend. I can&#8217;t afford to show any more blunders like today, I thought to myself.</p>



<p>Then it suddenly came to me.</p>



<p>….Why am I so worked up over a punishment game? Our relationship only lasts for a month. But then…why did it feel so lonely and regretful when I said goodbye to him?</p>



<p>I shook my head to dismiss the feelings deep within my heart and looked at my phone, which had been ringing with notifications since a while ago.</p>



<p>As expected when looking at the screen of my smartphone, messages from two people had arrived in rapid succession. I read the message to see what it was about.</p>



<p>『How did it go? Did you succeed in your confession?』</p>



<p>『Well, it should be alright. But tell me the results just in case.』</p>



<p>I looked at the messages sent to me and smiled bitterly. Then, in a simple group message, I reported the results.</p>



<p>&#8220;It worked. A lot happened, so I&#8217;ll give you a detailed report tomorrow. I&#8217;m going to sleep now. Good night.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was all I replied, and I ended the conversation. There were still a few messages coming in, but they must have thought I was asleep because they soon stopped messaging me.</p>



<p>Then I took a deep breath…and selected Youshin-kun from the icon in my app…For the first time in my life, I was somewhat happy to find the boy&#8217;s name with whom I exchanged my contact information.</p>



<p>Is his character icon from some kind of anime? It&#8217;s a picture of a girl with her hair braided cutely. Does he like this kind of thing?</p>



<p>I play with my hair, twirling it around my fingers. Most of the time, I would simply just tie it up or give it a loose perm. Basically, I don&#8217;t do any complex hairstyles.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have anyone to show it off to, so I thought it would be too much of a hassle. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve rarely had my hair done in the same fashion as Youshin&#8217;s character icon, even though I knew how to do it.</p>



<p>&#8220;… I&#8217;ll try braiding my hair.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unintentionally, my soliloquy spilled out of my mouth.</p>



<p>Without suppressing my beating heart, I sent him a message.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re dating, let&#8217;s go to school together tomorrow. Can you meet me at the station at 7:30?&#8221;</p>



<p>Does it sound too blunt?</p>



<p>Even though I thought so, the message I sent was immediately read. I felt happy that he saw my message, but I was also frustrated that he didn&#8217;t reply to my message right away…for some reason.</p>



<p>D-Did I say anything strange? …Or did he not read it through? Or is he just flustered because he&#8217;s not used to talking to girls? If so, I&#8217;d feel closer to him.</p>



<p>It probably won&#8217;t take him too long to respond…but, it felt like an eternity for me.</p>



<p>Finally, he replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy to be going to school with you, Nanami-san. 7:30 a.m? Understood. I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The bed I was lying on creaked as I jumped up in joy at the word &#8220;happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>But why the honorific? I was a little concerned about that, but I&#8217;m sure it was because this was something he wasn&#8217;t used to… I found him a little cute.</p>



<p>…..Eh, cute?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t even know anything about him, so why am I thinking like this?</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if this feeling is a result of the suspension bridge effect I&#8217;ve heard about or if I&#8217;m just starting to be attracted to him.</p>



<p>If I&#8217;m really starting to be attracted to him, then I feel like I&#8217;m being too easy. If that&#8217;s the case, then their worries were right on target…..</p>



<p>No, I&#8217;m not a chick. He&#8217;s just a trial run for me to get used to boys! I&#8217;m not that naive! This has to be the work of the suspension bridge effect!</p>



<p>I shake my head to deny the feelings that have arisen in me, feeling confused, bewildered, guilty, and a little bit of joy.</p>



<p>&#8220;But yeah, this is only temporary…. So I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>I decided to go to bed early today, just as I had declared to my two friends. With that one resolution in mind, I crawl into bed.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll have to get up earlier than usual tomorrow.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tomorrow…I&#8217;m meeting up with…Youshin…and going to school together…I&#8217;m going to school with my boyfriend…with my boyfriend…Youshin…boyfriend…&#8221;</p>



<p>As soon as I became aware of this, the embarrassment set in. I forced myself to close my eyes, my heart pounding on the bed I&#8217;d slipped into.</p>



<p>While I was nervous that I was meeting up with my boyfriend for the first time…I was soon struck by a sleep paralysis demon, probably due to my mental exhaustion during the daytime…and soon, my consciousness sank into a dream.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sinking…</p>



<p>In my dreams, I kept seeing Youshin with his nude upper body, and each time it happened, I got up…In the end, I slept less than usual that day.</p>



<p>However, I forced myself to accept the fact that I was able to wake up earlier than usual as planned, thanks to Youshin&#8217;s appearance in my dream.</p>
