<h3>Interlude - A Result of her Boldness</h3>


<p>Did I overdo it a little too much yesterday?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alone, I ask myself on the bed.</p>



<p>Remembering what happened, my face blushed a little, but I felt that I was too mean to Shibetsu Senpai for interrupting a valuable moment between us.</p>



<p>Eating lunch together with Youshin, I felt happy, although&#8230;I didn&#8217;t approve of Youshin&#8217;s actions yesterday, in the end, I did. </p>



<p>I remember the first thing Senpai said to me, and it made me feel somewhat disgusted. After all, Youshin still calls me by『San』, whereas Senpai still addresses me as 『Nanami』&#8230;</p>



<p>Well, I know that Senpai wasn&#8217;t a bad person. I understood that in my head very well. However, I wasn&#8217;t very good at dealing with that.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I flaunted my actions heedlessly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>I felt ashamed of myself.</p>



<p>I picked up the grain of rice on Youshin&#8217;s cheek, ate it, and went out of my way to snuggle close to him. No, it may have been a little too much eating the rice on Youshin&#8217;s cheeks.</p>



<p>Well, half of my intention was to show off to Senpai, but I thought I should have been aggressive to some extent with Youshin, who seems to be quiet and aggressive to a certain extent. I have no regrets.</p>



<p>In the end, Senpai said that Youshin and I make a good couple, which made me feel subconsciously happy. I was happy to hear him say that, although it&#8217;s only natural.</p>



<p>&#8220;He said that we were a good match&#8230;.but, are we really a good match?&#8221;</p>



<p>In the empty room, alone, I stared at the ceiling and muttered. Naturally, there was no answer. It was precisely because there was no answer that I was able to speak these words.</p>



<p>I wonder if Youshin would&#8217;ve been happy to hear that we&#8217;re a good match? It bothered me, but I couldn&#8217;t just ask him about it.</p>



<p>And while I am very happy to hear that we look good together, it was a little painful. At this moment, did I seem truly happy? I do feel happy, but for the me who lies, I no longer know my own feelings.</p>



<p>I have now lied not only to Youshin but to Senpai as well.</p>



<p>The Senpai who said that we were a good match, what would he think if he found out that our relationship was a punishment game? I-I&#8230;I&#8217;m the worst.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hah&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>I let out a small sigh and unbuttoned one of the buttons of my pyjamas. I thought my breathing felt a little heavy, but doing so didn&#8217;t change anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Youshin. He didn&#8217;t give me any reaction concerning the kiss on his cheeks, did he?&#8221;</p>



<p>After winning a basketball game, I unintentionally sent such a thing to Youshin in a fit of momentum and over-excitement, but his response was exceedingly cool.</p>



<p>『I&#8217;m happy. But, I&#8217;m a little embarrassed doing it at such a place.』</p>



<p>It was the only message I received after moments after he had read it. My mother even got angry with me because I was being too finicky, although I was awfully composed.</p>



<p>Perhaps, today would be the day where he brought up something about a reward, but that didn&#8217;t happen either. I was also wondering whether today would be the day when he would kiss me on the cheeks.</p>



<p>Maybe it was annoying? Or he doesn&#8217;t really like doing those kinds of things? Senpai also rushed in.</p>



<p>No, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>



<p>He said such cool things on the rooftop, which made me squeamish, and I&#8217;m not convinced that he doesn&#8217;t like to flirt with me in public just because he&#8217;s embarrassed.</p>



<p>Ahhhhh, my face is getting all hot and bothered just remembering it. Really, why does every single thing he says make me so happy?</p>



<p>I was so happy when I instinctively snuggled up to Youshin. I don&#8217;t exactly remember what we talked about, but I do remember the warmth of his body.</p>



<p>Someone who was warm, kind, and cared about me.</p>



<p>I was happy to have a connection with such a person, but at the same time, I felt guilty every day when I was alone. Because of this guilt and loneliness, I exchange messages with Youshin every night.</p>



<p>The things we talked about were silly. We would talk about school, among other things, like what we&#8217;d do tomorrow&#8230;&#8230;Tomorrow, yes, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see Youshin tomorrow.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to see a movie I&#8217;ve been looking forward to for a while now with Hatsumi and Ayumi, but as soon as I&#8217;m not able to meet him, I feel lonely.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll send lots of messages at least.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I was only able to enjoy romance through watching movies and such, but I never thought I would come to fall in love with a real-life boy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Will tomorrow&#8217;s movie be helpful in advancing my relationship with Youshin?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was excited that I would be able to enjoy the movie in a slightly different way than usual. Though I can&#8217;t see him tomorrow, I need to learn a lot for him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, a message from Youshin.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was talking to him a short while ago. And then a formal message comes from him. Didn&#8217;t he say he was going to play games until late today?</p>



<p>I lifted the edge of my mouth a little as I checked the message.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nanami-san, tomorrow&#8217;s movie. Have fun. I&#8217;ll miss seeing you, but I&#8217;m looking forward to Sunday.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was slightly stiff; however, the message seemed to have been written with me in mind. Just by looking at the message, I felt as if all the bad feelings inside me were melting away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;m looking forward to Sunday. I&#8217;ll be sending a lot of messages tomorrow too.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all I sent, I crawled into bed and closed my eyes in preparation for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I hope the movie&#8230;..doesn&#8217;t have too many H-scenes. With that thought in mind&#8230;&#8230;I went to sleep with a slightly lighter feeling in my heart.</p>
