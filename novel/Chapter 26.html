<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; Hunting the Adventurer Killer - End</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Uh-uh!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Oh,
Onii-chan!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Good morning, Miya-chan."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark,
Dark-san? Hey, this place is......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
is lying in one of the bedrooms in the suite room on the inn's top floor where
we are staying.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I am
sitting on a chair beside her bed, watching over her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Miya woke up, she looked around like a frightened little animal, maybe because
she doesn't know what's going on.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
she had calmed down enough, I told her the story I had prepared.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Last
night, when Gold was drinking at the Adventurer's Guild, he heard about the
'Adventurer Killer'..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
we heard this information, we immediately enter the dungeon to hunt the
"Adventurer Killer".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
searching in the dungeon at night, we coincidentally saw Miya, who was about to
be killed by a young elf man.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young elf man was surprised when we saw him, then he runs away into the deeper
of the dungeon part.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
securing Miya, who unconscious, we investigated the area and found her dying
brother Erio and the others. Unfortunately, Gimra and Wardy were already dead
when we found them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Based
on the circumstantial evidence, we concluded that the "young elf man"
is the "Adventurer Killer".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
cast a recovery spell on Erio, but he was seriously injured. To ensure their
safety and report the information, we immediately bring them out of the
dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
took Erio to a hospital in town for treatment and bring Miya back to the inn
where we are staying. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
went to the Adventurer's Guild to report about the "Adventurer
Killer".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, most of the story is a lie.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was a made-up story to keep Miya and the adventurers guild from getting
suspicious.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aside
from the Guild, Miya herself has a hazy memory thanks to the SR hypnosis. She
doesn't remember anything about her short stay in Naraku.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito,
the young elf man, is currently being interrogated in Naraku basement.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I've
ordered my subordinate to extract information about "Master" and
"Sub-Master" from him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I'm
sure that Ellie and the others are now reading his memories using forbidden
magic and other techniques that involve extreme pain.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">My
mask can hide my facial expression, but I still need to be careful not to sound
suspicious.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
guild has also concluded from circumstantial evidence that the young elf man is
most likely the ''Adventurer Killer''. They want to hear more about him when
Miya-chan wakes up."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I understand. Yes, there is no mistake that this person is the Adventurer
Killer. He suddenly appeared near us and ...... we told him about the
adventurer killer, and he said, [Next time I should be a little more careful
about covering up]. Then he attacked us. Onii-chan and the others......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
raises her upper body and grips the bed covers tightly with her small hands.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
take out two handkerchiefs from my pocket and hand them to her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"These
are?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"These
are the hair of Gimra and Wardy. Sorry, I managed to save Erio, but they......
I couldn't take their body's home."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Thank,
thank you so much!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Even if it's just the hair of the
deceased, I'm happy!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Thank you so much, thank you so
much--UUUUUUUUUUGH!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Finally
realizing that her friends' deaths are real, Miya-chan hugs the deceased hair
to her chest and burst into tears.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(When
I was facing Kaito, I used infinite Gacha cards to heal and protect them. I can
save Erio in time, but I couldn't save Gimra and Wardy.......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Resurrection
magic exists, but many conditions prevented me from resurrecting them. Once
human life is lost, no matter what kind of power I have, it cannot be easily
revived.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Maybe
it's enough for today.......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
decided to leave the room without saying anything else.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
after I closed the door, my ears still hear her crying inside the room because
of my high level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(I
did my best to level up to take revenge, but ...... having improved hearing is
a bit inconvenient at times like this.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
quietly moved away from the door and left her alone until she calmed down.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre6">☆</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Two
things have changed after the Adventurer Killer incident.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
first was that the...... Adventurers' Guild raised our rank by one rank for
providing information about the Adventurer Killer.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Later
that day, Miya went to the adventurer's Guild to explain the details.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
hearing Miya's and our detailed statement, the Guild was convinced that the
young elf man is the adventurer killer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
even made a sketch of him based on Miya's and our memories, and they warned the
adventurers about him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
even organized a team to hunt down the adventurer-killer, who had escaped deep
into the dungeon (based on our testimony).</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
thought that I need to hand over the Adventurer Killer's body to raise my rank.
It was unexpected luck that the information alone was enough to raise my rank
to C class.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
second thing is that Miya and Erio have decided to quit working as adventurers.
They gave up on going to the Sixth Principality Magic School and return to
their hometown.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
was discharged from the hospital. The two of them dispose of their bags that
they left at the inn.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
will leave this city tomorrow early morning to go to their hometown as an
escort for a merchant group. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
came to greet us, the people who saved their lives and took care of them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
take Miya and Erio up to the living room of the inn's top floor suite and
listens to their story.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
put a pot of tea on the table in front of them as they sit on the sofa. I sit
on the sofa across them while Gold stand in the room corner.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
and Erio bow deeply.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you so much for saving my brother's life and taking care of us."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you so much for helping us....... I owe my life to Dark-san and the others.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
we also received some advice and burn medicine. Saving your life was...... just
a coincidence."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
can't tell them that it was because of the power of the "SSR, Praying
Misanga". Besides, I don't want to remind them about their bad experience.
I couldn't save Gimra and Wardy. It was just luck that I was able to save Erio.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
matter how high my level is, I can't do everything. My power is not almighty.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
try to change the subject.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
said that you quit working as an adventurer and will return to your hometown.
But Erio-san is hard working person, and Miya-chan is a talented magician.
Maybe the two of you can team up with other people and continue working as an
adventurer?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
in fact, some adventurers offered us to join them. But after what happened to
us, I am too afraid to enter the dungeons again......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
hands trembled as she clutched them in her lap.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
friends had been killed in front of her eyes. She and her brother almost lost
their lives too.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
no wonder she's too scared to enter the dungeon again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
laughs as if she's in trouble and says...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Beside...
I became an adventurer and went into dungeons because everyone was with me. We
can't do it alone. Right, Onii-chan?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yeah,
that's why I don't think it's a good idea to team up with other people right
now. Besides, we want to return Gimra and Wardy's hair to our homeland. Then
hopefully, the two of us can support ourselves with some help from our
relatives."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
see."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
gloomy air filled the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
change the atmosphere, Miya speaks cheerfully, but her voice sounds dry.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
can't enter the Principality's magic school, but I'm going to work hard with my
brother and never give up. I will study magic on my own to become a magician
that people won't laugh at. If Dark-san and the others visit my hometown,
please contact us."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Sure,
when the time comes."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
we'll be waiting for you. Everyone in my hometown will welcome you guys with
open arms."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Absolutely,
Dark-san. We'll be waiting for you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
two responded with positive smiles.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
a quick conversation with Gold and Nemumu, Miya and Erio left the inn.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
are left alone in the room.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
going back to Naraku. If there's a visitor for me, please ask them to come back
later."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Understand,
my lord."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
leave Nemumu and Gold in the room and return to Naraku with SSR, Transfer.</span></p></div>
