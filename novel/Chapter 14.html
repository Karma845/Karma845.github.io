<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; 15 New Party "Black Clown"</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
third level of the dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
swamps are populated by giant frogs, poisonous leeches, mosquitoes, and other
monsters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are many large and small swamps, and it is easy to lose your footing and get
stuck in the swamp.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
it was considered to be more dangerous than the first and second levels.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
amount of reward earned from the third level is high, but not many adventurers
can make it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Tonight,
after another hunting trip, four members of the skilled human party had set up
their tents on the ground with a good view and finished preparing the
encampment.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
left the members who are in charge of the night shift behind to prepare for
tomorrow and get some sleep.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
of them are humans and around level 50.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are a veteran party that has hunted in the swamp many times.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Two
of them take turns being the night watch.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
front of the fire, two members in charge of the night watch chat to forget
their sleepiness.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
conversation is naturally related to their quest.</span></p>




<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
heard that the other day some beastmen got into trouble with a human party
called the Black Clown. They are a new human party that had recently appeared,
and the beastmen were no match for them. It was a relief to hear that the
usually arrogant beastmen were beaten to a pulp."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan,
the party's scout and in charge of spotting the enemy, speaks out happily while
drinking warm water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gilbert,
the party vanguard, is also on the night watch. He strokes his chin with his
rugged palm.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What's
this thing called the Black Clown?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
you know?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">It's the most famous adventuring party
now. A boy in a clown mask, a golden knight, and a fairy princess has already
reached the fifth level of a dungeon in just a few days."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey
Svalan, don't lie to me. We all know that it's impossible to reach the 5th
floor in a few days, right? If you're going to lie, you should be more
realistic."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
it's true. In fact, they even brought Yeti's magic stone to the Adventurer's
Guild. Many adventurers actually saw it on the spot. But how do the "black
clown" managed to reach the 5th floor? It seems that no one knows how they
do that..."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan
also tells him the unbelievable fact.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"And
the boy in the clown mask apparently can cast tactical class magic without
chanting at that age."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
No, no, no way. That's impossible. Maybe you can fool amateur magicians, but I
won't be fooled. I'm a vanguard and don't know much about magic, but I've been
doing this for years. At least I've basic knowledge about magic."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
understand your feelings, Gilbert. I couldn't believe my ears at first. But I
know someone who's actually seen him cast the magic without a chant. And not
just any adventurer, but a human magician."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aah,
you mean Miya, the sister of the red-haired sibling?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
human magician is very rare to find.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Especially
if it is a woman.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
had dropped out of the magic school due to financial problems. However, she is
still a magician in the adventurer's eye.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
she first appeared in this city, some human parties approached her. Still, they
failed miserably because of her brother's presence and Miya's shyness. They
don't want to anger the magician by forcibly recruiting her, so no one dared to
bother her after that."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">From
the other races' perspective, there is a prejudice that "human magicians
are useless". Furthermore, their pride won't allow them to bow down to a
race that is inferior to them". That's why other races party never tries
to recruit her.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
seems that Miya, who is quite famous, was talking excitedly in the restaurant.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not only the battle class, but he also can use tactical class magic without
chanting.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gilbert
gulped from the tension.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......If
that's true, that's an outrageous story. A human who can use magic without chanting.
He's a genius magician..... No, a hero. Maybe he is reincarnated hero, isn't
he?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
the person is an elf, demon, or dragonman who is good at magic, it would be
understandable.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
from what they've heard, it was a human that pulled it off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Based
on common sense as an adventurer, even if the world turned upside down, that's
impossible.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
it would be impossible for him not to be surprised.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
Gilbert's surprised, Svalan drinks his warm water.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"A
hero, reincarnated hero... Gilbert, isn't that's a good analogy? I hope that in
the future, that hero will overturn this bullshit racism. <span>Whenever
something happens</span>, they look down on us."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Well,
you're right... discrimination against the human race is terrible. I think it's
getting worse these days than it used to be."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Is
that so?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I think it's always been this bad,
sorry. I drank too much."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan
stands up with a shovel in his hand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
wants to pee after drinking too much water.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gilbert
teasingly tells him.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Make
sure you dig a hole and bury it. I don't want to spend the night smelling your
pee."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know, I know. Don't get attacked by a monster just because you're not with this
party's scout."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hahaha.
Shut up, quickly go. Don't wet your pants."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
shut up."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
men were talking nonsense but keeping their guard up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan
stepped away from the fire and into the darkness to keep the smells away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
didn't want to show himself half-naked, even if it is with his friends. So he
kept his distance and moved into the darkness.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he is far enough, he dug a hole in the ground.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Fuuuh...."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As a
man, he can do it standing up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he was done, he washed his hands with water and closed the hole again using his
shovel.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
the hole was too shallow, the smell would reach the fire and the tent, so an
experienced adventurer would dig the hole deeper.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Newbies
don't know this, so they just follow what they see and fill in the holes as
they see fit, and make mistakes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Svalan just starting out, he failed to do this so often and always gets scolded
by his friends......</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Now
that was a good memory....... no, it wasn't. Gilbert's pee smelled so bad that
the camp was dismantled, and they have to move away."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Suddenly
he remembered something that made him angry, so he returned to the fire to give
another sarcastic remark to Gilbert.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gilbert
should have been sitting by the fire with his huge bear-like body curled up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
he was already gone.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You're
just a bug. Isn't it disrespectful to keep me waiting?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gilbert's
corpse is lying on the ground, his head severed from his body.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">And a
strange young Elven male is standing there, stepping on it.</span></p></div>
