<h2>Chapter 11: The Eye of God</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>I read the characters written on the monument.</p>

<p>&#12302;The defeat of the Whites is near. The world will fall into their hands, and eternal submission will rule the world. Even our God has perished. It is because the one who possessed ... betrayed us. For that reason, we used up all the lives of we knights and the princess activated the last magic.&#12303;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What...What is this? Only this spot is missing, I can&rsquo;t read it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;I'm sorry, children of the future. Please forgive us for entrusting everything to you. At least, we will pass on the power to fight.&#12303;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pass on? What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;To those recognized as knights who see this, please be strong. And we wish that our eyes will be passed on to the righteous one. To the one who has a soul full of love and shines beautifully. And...&#12303;</p>

<p>The last sentence was carved with extraordinary strength.</p>

<p>&#12302;That golden shining soul will even illuminate the darkness that will someday cover the world.&#12303;</p>

<p>That was all written on the monument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I don't really understand. Did someone who lost a battle with someone else write this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I left the monument, which I couldn't understand at all, in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>I somehow feel as if that writing is something really important but right now, I have no idea what it means.</p>

<p>I then looked at the pedestal.</p>

<p>I reached out for the golden tag on the pedestal and took it.</p>

<p>On the front was a mark that looked like a coat of arms with a shield and sword, and on the back was a carved inscription.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... There are characters carved on it... I read this too. Um... Lancelot? Is it yours, Sir Lancelot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the back on the golden tag, &#8810;Lancelot&#8811; was inscribed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I wear it around my neck? Is it an accessory or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put the tag around my neck.</p>

<p>It may be an item enchanted with magic.</p>

<p>I thought it was a little careless, but it wasn't a cursed piece of equipment or something, right?</p>

<p> &ldquo;...ugh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After I put the tag around my neck, scenes flashed through my mind like a flashback.</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>In front of me were 10,000 knights wearing black armor.</p>

<p>I was the only white knight to fight against them.</p>

<p>Behind me was a girl possessing many enormous wings. She appeared as if she were a beautiful archangel.</p>

<p>I was strong.</p>

<p>Each of the black knights was so strong that they seemed to have reached S-rank.</p>

<p>Even still, the white knight surpassed even them, he was simply strong.</p>

<p>With a flash of white dominating the battlefield. Even while alone, he seemed to be able to push back the entirety of their forces.</p>

<p>However, the black knights didn't diminish; on the contrary, they increased.</p>

<p>I was forced to struggle with stronger individuals.</p>

<p>Even from my perspective, victory was impossible in this battle.</p>

<p>Still, the white knight didn't give up, burning with passion and risking their life.</p>

<p>With their sparkling golden eyes and sword, they didn't let any enemy reach the woman behind them.</p>

<p>&#12302;Lancelot... I'm sorry... for giving you as well...this horrible task...even though you had just become my knight. &#12303;</p>

<p>The girl was crying.</p>

<p>Her hands clasped together as she continued to pray to the sky in order to complete some kind of ritual.</p>

<p>Endless tears streamed down her cheeks and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>As I watched those tears, my chest began to ache.</p>

<p>The emotions of this white knight flowed endlessly into my heart.</p>

<p>This emotion must be...</p>

<p>The white knight spoke up.</p>

<p>&#12302;Please don't say such a thing, my lady... I who had nothing before... it was your kindness that saved me. You gave me these eyes, and I became strong enough to protect you. I am honored to serve you!!&#12303;</p>

<p>The white knight's eyes also filled with tears, but he did not let them fall.</p>

<p>He repelled the force of over 10,000 and continued to protect the girl called the princess until the very end.</p>

<p>&#12302;I was truly happy...&#12303;</p>

<p>He raised his sword and faced forward, his eyes, which seemed to burn, reflected not an ounce of fear.</p>

<p>&#12302;My life is not precious, for the sake of the world's future... no, for you, I will dedicate it for eternity. But if I may ask for one thing...&#12303;</p>

<p>The white knight spoke to his own heart, as if speaking to me.</p>

<p>&#12302;I wish that someday, a strong knight will appear who possesses strength, knowledge, and heart. It's selfish of me, but... let me entrust it to you, the knight of this era. And I hope that this soul will one day dispel the darkness of the world. So...&#12303;</p>

<p>With those words, the light released from the girl enveloped the entire world.</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;!?... What was that just now...&quot;</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes, I was back in my original world.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment, but it felt like I was seeing a different memory...</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I was crying.</p>

<p>The memory from earlier was vague, like a dream, but tears were streaming down my face. The tears that I had been desperately holding back had suddenly overwhelmed my heart and were now flowing uncontrollably.</p>

<p>For a brief moment, I was lost in thought.</p>

<p>My heart was swaying for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>For about an hour, I just sat there blankly.</p>

<p>But finally, my heart settled down and I stood up.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand. I don't know why, but I have a feeling that I should receive this tag. And also, this huh...&rsquo;Pass on&rsquo; so... this is the Eye of God?&quot;</p>

<p>It was the moment I touched the small golden pyramid-like object on the pedestal.</p>

<p>The pyramid shone brightly and turned into particles that were absorbed into my body.</p>

<p>&quot;What!?&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;The bestowal of the Eye of God is beginning. Completion in 600,000, 599,999...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? M-my head...&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I touched it, I suddenly felt an excruciating pain in my head, like it was splitting open.</p>

<p>I couldn't bear it, and immediately fell to my knees and lost consciousness.</p>

<p>&#12302;Completion... 100, 99...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I regained consciousness, but I couldn't see anything.</p>

<p>It felt like I was floating in water, weightless and dizzy.</p>

<p>I felt like I was speaking, but it was just in my head and didn't come out of my mouth.</p>

<p>Is this a dream? I'm pretty sure I suddenly lost consciousness.</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;2,1,0...The bestowal of the Eye of God has been completed. Conforming the library in order to match common sense of the species: Human. Time until completion: 10 seconds...completion rate 99.99%.&#12303;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm? What? Is something happening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could only hear the emotionless voice.</p>

<p>What on earth was happening? Was I dead?</p>

<p>&#12302;The challenger, Kai Amachi, has cleared the God's Knight selection ceremony. As a reward, he has been given the Eye of God and granted level 1 access.&#12303;</p>

<p>Then, the system voice explained to me as if answering my question. Even though it didn't respond to me at all during the trial, now it was willingly answering me.</p>

<p>&quot;The Eye of God? What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;It's the power given to knights who have cleared the God's Knight selection ceremony. You can view all information that exists, such as the Seal Boxes.&#12303;</p>

<p> &quot;Seal Boxes? Do you mean the Cube?&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;Yes. ...Body repair complete, Eye of God bestowed, library updated. All processes are complete. Please specify where you want to go and we will transfer you.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Where I want to go?... I want to go home. But before that, a question--&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;Transferring. Destination coordinates: registered. Now transferring to Kai Amachi&rsquo;s residence.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;Hey! Wait, hold on&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;*Congratulations*, Kai Amachi. Your full of compassion and beautifully shining soul, we pray will drive away the darkness that will one day cover the world.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Hey! Hold on&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;I entrust this to you... our eyes, and his emblem.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;Huh... eh?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I thought it had gone dark, I found myself reaching towards the familiar ceiling.</p>

<p>It was my bed, which I had left unmade recently.</p>

<p>The feeling of relief, the calming space, it was my home.</p>

<p>&quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>I touched my body, it was the same as always.</p>

<p>My body was unscathed, and my musty-smelling house was the same as usual.</p>

<p>&quot;I&rsquo;m alive? Was it a dream? Everything until now?&quot;</p>

<p>I held back my tears and searched for my smartphone, which was in my pocket as usual. Surprisingly, it wasn't cracked.</p>

<p>Then I checked the time.</p>

<p>&quot;...It wasn't a dream...it's been a week...&quot;</p>

<p>Today was August 13th.</p>

<p>I participated in the Golden Cube on August 6th, so there was no doubt that a week had passed.</p>

<p>I stared at my hands.</p>

<p>Still confused about what had happened, I saw something impossible next to my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;What is this?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a scene that any Japanese person would be familiar with.</p>

<p>However, it was a scene that was impossible in the real world, something from a fantasy or a game.</p>

<p>What was there was...</p>

<p>&quot;...A Status!?&quot;</p>

<p>My information was displayed like a game system window.</p>

<p> Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p> Status: Good</p>

<p> Job: None</p>

<p> Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p> Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p> Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>&quot;What the hell is this?&quot;</p>

<p>I see my status screen reflected in my hand.</p>

<p> Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p> Status: Good</p>

<p> Job: None</p>

<p> Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p> Magic Power: 5</p>

<p> Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p> Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p> Dexterity: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p> Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p> Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>

<p>&quot;Is this my status? It even has my name on it... Wait, did I get transported to my house? I don't even know what's going on anymore...&quot;</p>

<p>My last memory was touching that golden eye.</p>

<p>I thought it might have been a dream, but it's been a week since I entered the dungeon.</p>

<p>I know for sure that I went into the dungeon, it wasn't a dream.</p>

<p>Despite this, I couldn't believe it myself and decided to go outside.</p>

<p>&quot;It's the usual scenery...&quot;</p>

<p>It was the same run-down apartment, the same scenery, but one thing was different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see my status... and other people's too...&quot;</p>

<p>When I focus on people walking by, their stats appear.</p>

<p>I don't know how to express it, but if I want to see them, I can.</p>

<p>If I don't want to see them, their status won't appear.</p>

<p>&quot;Come to think of it, the reward for completely conquering the dungeon was the Eye of God... Is this the Eye of God? Did I conquer it? And what's with this Emblem of the Knight?&quot;</p>

<p>I don't really understand it, but it seems I've somehow conquered that golden cube.</p>

<p>There's a golden tag around my neck with Lancelot inscribed on it.</p>

<p>I don't really know the meaning of &quot;complete conquest,&quot; but if it means giving the key to Tanaka and the others at that time, I think it was a really shitty trial.</p>

<p>&quot;What should I do... For now... I'm hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>I haven't eaten anything for a week, so my stomach was on the verge of starving.</p>

<p>I take my wallet, which has my entire savings, and head to the nearby gyudon bowl restaurant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll have a beef bowl with extra toppings, a miso soup with a lot of raw egg, and a side dish of pickled vegetables!&quot;</p>

<p>I order the most luxurious meal that I usually can't afford.</p>

<p>Well, this shows how poor my family's financial situation is.</p>

<p>I saved a week's worth of food expenses, and I should be receiving a participation fee of one million yen.</p>

<p>&quot;Here you go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Asano-san... Your magic power is only 54...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Have we met somewhere before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Sorry, I was just muttering my friend's name!&quot;</p>

<p>I accidentally read the staff's stats out loud. I can see their name, occupation, level, and magic power.</p>

<p>What's with this human scouter?</p>

<p>I want to call his status trash, but I restrain myself.</p>

<p>By the way, their magic power is more than 10 times mine, so I'm the trash.</p>

<p>And what's this unfamiliar item, &quot;reflection rate&quot;? It seems to be the reflection rate for magic power.</p>

<p>My magic power is 5, which matches what the association measured before.</p>

<p>The reflection rate of 25% for my magic power is listed as my attack power, which is 1.</p>

<p>Does that mean my attack power is 1? I can't even imagine something like that being expressed as a numerical value.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even though he works at a gyudon bowl restaurant, the worker in front of me displays&#12302;None&#12303;as his job.</p>

<p>The worker makes a strange expression but seemingly satisfied with that answer, separates from me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have no idea what this is but...anyways!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the matter of my status but, at the moment my main goal was the gyudon bowl in front of me.</p>

<p>I vigorously split the disposable chopsticks and devoured my favorite dish after a week of not eating.</p>

<p>With my stomach now satisfied, I took a break, drank some water, and decided to ponder a little.</p>

<p>&quot;This skill, called The Eye of God, must be the reward. I don't really understand it, but I seem to be able to see people's statuses... It's not like this is a manga.&quot;</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the skill called God's Eye is the reward I was given for clearing a challenge. And this skill has the benefit of being able to see people's statuses.</p>

<p>Although all I can understand is related to magic power and name.</p>

<p>&quot;To be honest, I don't really understand anything. Anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>I stand up and decide on my destination.</p>

<p>&quot;Should I go check on Nagi?&quot;</p>

<p>I head to the National Clearer&rsquo;s Hospital to check on my little sister.</p>

<p>It's not that I don't trust Tanaka-san, but I still want to see her with my own eyes and feel at ease.</p>

<p>&quot;The Cube in Shibuya disappeared... Oh, it looks like they're treating me as dead. What should I do?&quot;</p>

<p>I search for news on my smartphone.</p>

<p>It's only been a week, so it seems like my phone plan hasn't been cancelled yet, which is good. Maybe I need to go through a bunch paperwork? Since I was thought to be dead but am actually alive.</p>

<p>While riding the train, I look outside.</p>

<p>It's the usual scenery, and there are strange boxes standing in the usual urban landscape.</p>

<p>Cubes, come to think of it, they were called Seal Boxes...</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?! Did that just happen!?&quot;</p>

<p>As I absentmindedly stare at the cube, I suddenly notice that the same status as a person appeared on the cube.</p>

<p>However, I couldn't read what was there because I had already passed it by.</p>

<p>&quot;The Cube also has a status!?&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I arrived at my destination station, I headed straight to the nearest cube.</p>

<p>It should be an E-class cube that I had cleared once before.</p>

<p>It hasn't gone into hibernation mode yet, so if a few more days pass, the dungeon will collapse and monsters will appear outside.</p>

<p>However, the Association manages it, so they will dispatch clearers immediately.</p>

<p>And then I saw that blue cube, an E-class cube according to the grade established by humanity.</p>

<p>Remaining Magic Power&#65306;30/50 (+1/24hr)</p>

<p>Clear Difficulty&#65306;E Rank</p>

<p>&#9670;Reward</p>

<p>First Clear Reward (Complete)&#65306;Magic Power +10</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;While the dungeon hasn&rsquo;t been cleared before, defeat the boss.</p>

<p>Complete Clear Reward&#65306;Current access level is unable to display this.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;Clear while solo.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 2&#12288;Defeat a 100 or more goblins.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 3&#12288;Defeat the boss within three minutes&#12290;</p>

<p>&quot;What is this...,&quot;</p>

<p>As I stared at the cube, a status appeared before me.</p>

<p>Or rather, it was the information on the Cube?</p>

<p>There was information written that nobody knew about the Cubes that humanity had been fighting for the past 20 years.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this real? Remaining Magic Power? Something like this... and there's a clear reward, but I can't see it.&quot;</p>

<p>The first thing that came to my mind as I saw the information was the clear reward.</p>

<p>It was true that people awakened when the Cubes appeared, and it was also rumored that their strength increased with every cube they cleared them.</p>

<p>However, it was said to be a rare occurrence, and it was mostly considered an urban legend.</p>

<p>&quot;So, there are two types of clears for the Cube, first clear and complete clear. Of course, someone has already conquered this cube for the first time, but the complete conquest is still not achieved... I don't know what the reward is yet...&quot;</p>

<p>I deduced this from the information.</p>

<p>It was just speculation, but it seemed like that was what was written.</p>

<p>As for the complete clear reward, maybe it would increase the maximum value of magic power, considering the clear reward.</p>

<p>&quot;... Can I become stronger?&quot;</p>

<p>My magic power was only 5, less than half of an ordinary person who wasn&rsquo;t a clearer.</p>

<p>However, if I could conquer the cube using these eyes, I might become stronger.</p>

<p>I couldn't just swallow this information blindly, but what could this power given to me accomplish?</p>

<p>Still, I couldn't help but have a little hope.</p>

<p>&quot;A-anyway, I'll postpone this verification for later!&quot;</p>

<p>I went straight to the hospital.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Um... it's Kai Amachi. I came to visit Nagi Amachi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please wait a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>I went to the receptionist as usual and requested a visit. I was expecting or rather fearing a reaction like &quot;Ghost!?&quot; but there was none of that.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh? From the general ward... to the bereaved family ward... and now in a special private room? Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by a special private room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, just the other day, Nagi Amachi-san was moved to the bereaved family ward, but immediately moved to a private room. The special private room is on the top floor and is very spacious...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p>

<p>I immediately thought it was Tanaka-san&rsquo;s doing.</p>

<p>Nagi was supposed to have been moved to the bereaved family ward a week before when I was declared dead.</p>

<p>But Tanaka-san must have immediately moved her to a different room.</p>

<p>The bereaved family ward could only receive the minimum treatment.</p>

<p>In contrast, a special private room was a livable level room mainly reserved for the wealthy.</p>

<p>I heard that it costs around 1 million yen per month.</p>

<p>&quot;Heh, that's just like him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing. So... can I visit her now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but we cannot guide you to the patients in the special ward without permission from their legal guardian. Would you like me to contact them for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, no, it's okay! I'll go get permission first.&quot;</p>

<p>Apologizing to the receptionist, I leave the hospital with a plan to visit Tanaka first.</p>

<p>&quot;Heh, I wonder if Tanaka-san will be surprised?&quot;</p>

<p>With a mischievous thought in my heart, I head to the headquarters of Japan's largest and strongest guild,&#12302;Avalon&#12303;.</p>

<p>&quot;Toranomon... it's an amazing place. No wonder it's Japan's number one guild. It's like a first-class company... or something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>With my smartphone in hand, I look up the location of Avalon's headquarters and head there. It's located in the heart of Japan, surrounded by the country's representative companies and government buildings like the National Diet Building and Kasumigaseki.</p>

<p>~After a few minutes on the train...</p>

<p>&quot;Here's Toranomon...&quot;</p>

<p>It's summer, and Japan's global warming continues.</p>

<p>In the concrete jungle, a poor man in shorts steps off.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m dressed in a cheap outfit from Uniqlo that cost a total of 3,000 yen, including my pants.</p>

<p>I weave my way through the well-dressed businessmen around me and head to my destination. Each one of their ties alone probably cost more than my entire outfit.</p>

<p>And then I arrived at the building I was looking for.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the Avalon headquarters building... it's so huge.&quot;</p>

<p>It's a towering skyscraper, the headquarters of Japan's largest and strongest guild and company.</p>

<p>It was Avalon Headquarters.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>I was standing in front of a giant skyscraper, looking up.</p>

<p>I wore black shorts and a plain white shirt, my basic summer style.</p>

<p>If judged solely on color, I wasn't that different from people in suits.</p>

<p>But the total cost of my outfit was probably lower than just one of their ties.</p>

<p>To put it in other words, it was a little embarrassing.</p>

<p>Imagine. A complete buffoon dressed in shorts standing among the business elite, sharply dressed in business suits.</p>

<p>&quot;This seems like the place... I&rsquo;ll probably be turned away at the entrance.&quot;</p>

<p>I took a step forward.</p>

<p>Though surprisingly, there were a lot of roughly dressed people around.</p>

<p>It made sense, though, as it was the headquarters of a guild with many dungeon clearers on staff, who often wore rough looking clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;As expected, guilds are profitable...&quot;</p>

<p>I entered the building and looked at some art pieces I didn't quite understand.</p>

<p>Was having a fountain indoors considered fashionable?</p>

<p>If it was an indication of how much money they were making hand over fist, then it was quite ironic.</p>

<p>Running a guild is profitable, and while it&rsquo;s not even worth putting into words, many guilds have been disbanded in the dungeon in pursuit of that profit. Even still, they still make a profit.</p>

<p>Safety was prioritized above all else, and people all over the world had no choice but to pay for it.</p>

<p>VIP protection, disaster relief, dungeon collapses, dungeon raids, the buying and selling of magic stones and monster materials.</p>

<p>The employment opportunities created by Cube and the awakening of humanity were countless.</p>

<p>By the way, magic stones apparently had an incredible energy conversion efficiency.</p>

<p>I was not familiar with science, so I didn't know the details, but it was surprising that a single A-class magic stone could supply the energy of an entire town for several days.</p>

<p>There was no way Japan's number one guild wasn't making money.</p>

<p>It was now the top guild in Japan, with an impact on the country's politics and economy as well as the global economy.</p>

<p>That was the strongest guild in Japan, Avalon.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, excuse me...&quot;</p>

<p>I spoke to the receptionist at the first-floor lobby.</p>

<p>I didn't know why there were three receptionists, but they were all beautiful so I was nervous. They all seemed like serious office lady types.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, how can I help you?&quot;</p>

<p>The receptionist smiled and spoke to me.</p>

<p>Her good personality was evident in her willingness to help even a poorly dressed person like me.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, I'd like to meet Tanaka-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And may I have his full name, please?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's Issei Tanaka-san. He's the Vice President!&quot;</p>

<p>The receptionist looked surprised.</p>

<p>Well, if someone in this kind of outfit suddenly showed up and asked for the Vice President, they would be surprised.</p>

<p>If it were me, I would either turn them away or call the police.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but may I have your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My name is Kai Amachi. If you pass along just my name, probably... he&rsquo;ll come meet be.&quot;</p>

<p>The receptionist who up until just a moment ago was kind to me was now simply suspicious of me.</p>

<p>No way, does she think I&rsquo;m a suspicious person? Well, he is Japan&rsquo;s top Vice President, being under someone&rsquo;s crosshairs probably isn&rsquo;t rare.</p>

<p>In any case, I don&rsquo;t think the A Rank Tanaka-san is going to lose to any thug.</p>

<p>&quot;Please wait a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite that, I felt relieved that they were still going to contact him for me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, please connect me to Vice President Tanaka...Ah, this is the reception on the first floor. Yes, Tanaka-sama, your guest has arrived. They said there was no appointment...Yes, the name is Kai Amachi...No, Kai, Amachi. Yes...Huh!? Oh, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Then the receptionist who was on the phone looked at me with a surprised expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Um...Vice President Tanaka will be here shortly. Can you wait?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's good to hear.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to wait in the lobby's chair.</p>

<p>The receptionist whispered something to someone else, but I wondered what they were thinking when the vice president suddenly came down to greet me.</p>

<p>It's understandable since I'm just a recently graduated high school student who looks poor, not some CEO.</p>

<p>I waited for a few minutes while looking at the fountain.</p>

<p>I looked at the stats of many clearers, all of whom had magical power dozens or hundreds of times higher than mine.</p>

<p>Playing with this like it&rsquo;s a Scouter is fun.</p>

<p>I wonder if there will someday be a super-clearer that shows up with a level that would blow up this Scouter? But please spare me the explosion.</p>

<p>&quot;Haa, haa...&quot;</p>

<p>Then Tanaka-san, who was out of breath, appeared in a sharp suit from the elevator and looked around.</p>

<p>His equipment during dungeon conquests had a magical swordsman feel, which was cool, but he suited a suit more.</p>

<p>He seemed to have run here with all his might, and his atmosphere was very intense.</p>

<p>Seeing his state, other conquerors and employees became frantic, wondering what was going on.</p>

<p>I felt a little embarrassed but still raised my hand slowly.</p>

<p>Seeing that, Tanaka-san rushed to me with such speed that the floor caved in and grabbed my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun...Kai-kun, is it you!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I'm, uh, how do I say it? alive...!?&quot;</p>

<p>Before I could say anything, Tanaka-san hugged me tightly.</p>

<p>It was gentle, and he smelled good.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad...Really...Kai-kun...I'm sorry, I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought that might be the case. That choice couldn't have been wrong. I'm glad. Really...What on earth happened, Kai-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, well, should we change the location for now?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Tanaka hugged me with his undivided attention.</p>

<p>It was a bit embarrassing, or rather, very embarrassing, with the surrounding glances.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san was seriously crying.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes. Let's do that. Shall we go to my room?&quot;</p>

<p>I was then taken by Mr. Tanaka to his workplace.</p>

<p>We rode in a bigger elevator than my house and headed to the top floor.</p>

<p>When we opened the particularly heavy wooden door of a room on that floor, and past that was Tanaka-san&rsquo;s office or study? That kind of feeling of room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get some tea and snacks for guests. Ah, for two people. That, and call for Midori.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Tanaka-san arrived in the room, he gave instructions to someone over the phone.</p>

<p>It seems I can also meet Midori-san. She cried a lot too, so she'll probably cry a lot if she sees me...</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and I sat on luxurious chairs with a desk in between.</p>

<p>&quot;So, Kai-kun, can you tell me what happened? You hadn&rsquo;t returned for a week so... as it was I thought...&quot;</p>

<p>(Should I not talk about the eyes yet? It's not that I don't trust Tanaka-san, but I still don't understand it myself.)</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, I have no idea either.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided not to talk about the Eye of God yet. In the first place, I still didn't understand it myself, so I'll talk about it when I understand it a bit more.</p>

<p>Then, I told him that I woke up and I was home. To be honest, it was a crazy story, but Tanaka-san still believed me.</p>

<p>&quot;I see, that's fine. I always thought that there could be no mistake in your choice during the Trial of the Heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, I might have put up too much of a cool front.&quot;</p>

<p>When I blushed a little, Tanaka-san lowered their head again.</p>

<p>&quot;... You might say you forgive me, but I still can't forgive myself. I'm really sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;P-please stop! I took it myself, and you tried to die in my place, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, honestly... it was only a sense of obligation. So, if I had been in the same situation, in the end, I might not have been able to make the same choice. I said I would be a sacrifice, but in truth, I really didn't want to die, to be honest.&quot;</p>

<p>Still, Tanaka-san didn't raise their head.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what else to say so I decided to change the subject.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right. Did you move Nagi's room, Tanaka-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Oh, yeah, I don't think it's going to make up for what I did...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I was really happy about it. But, no that I&rsquo;m alive, You can move my sister to the general...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! I can't allow that. Please let me take care of her.&quot;</p>

<p>I suggested moving Nagi to a general ward, but Tanaka-san leaned forward and strongly refused.</p>

<p>He told me that he had made a vow that day, and received it as a wish, so he at least wanted to be allowed to do this.</p>

<p>&quot;A-alright... please do it within reasonable limits.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave in. Tanaka-san was stubbornly refusing, so I thought it would be rude to push any further.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it, even though I&rsquo;m like this, I'm making quite a lot of money now.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, that's understandable.</p>

<p>They rose up as a clearer and even became the Vice-President of this guild.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right. I'm supposed to be dead...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'll take care of that. I reported the death to the association, but I&rsquo;ll say it was a mistake. So, you can continue your activities as usual.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, thank you very much!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, what are you going to do from now on? I hope I don&rsquo;t come off the wrong way but if you are in any financial need...&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, this much already is more than enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;However... my feelings won't settle that easily. Oh, I know! How about joining my group? If I recommend you, you could even pass the test--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>

<p>I restrained Tanaka-san with my hand and strongly rejected his proposal, opposite to what I had suggested earlier.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san seemed to have thought it was a good idea and was surprised by my refusal, but she quickly reconsidered.</p>

<p>&quot;An unranked like me getting into Japan's top Avalon guild through Tanaka-san's introduction is nothing but a connection-based employment. You forgot about my rank, Tanaka-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You're right, sorry about that.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san looked a little down.</p>

<p>I was an unranked, an awakened person with little magical power.</p>

<p>I couldn't forget about that. If I joined Japan's top guild like this, I would either be bullied or rumored to be Tanaka-san's illegitimate child.</p>

<p>That's why I had made up my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;So I'll get stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll get stronger, and if you really want me to join as a clearer, please invite me again.&quot;</p>

<p>I asked Tanaka-san for a handshake.</p>

<p>He looked surprised at first, then smiled and shook my hand.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a story that would be impossible normally, but I somehow believe it. Have you gotten stronger than a week ago, Kai-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My eyesight has improved a little.&quot;</p>

<p>I returned a smile.</p>

<p>After that, I was tackled by Midori-san, who had joined us.</p>

<p>She was still regretting the last incident and didn't listen even when I said it was okay.</p>

<p>So, from now on, Midori-san finally agreed with the condition that she would heal me for free whenever I asked.</p>

<p>Honestly, I was grateful since I tended to get injured easily.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure that's okay? If there's anything I can help you with...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Tanaka-san! I have one request!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm? Oh, yeah! Anything, just say it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want a weapon, so can you recommend a good store?!&quot;</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>Yes, we have transferred the participation reward of 1 million yen!</p>

<p>I was at the Tokyo branch of the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san had contacted the association and informed them that I had survived from within the Golden Cube.</p>

<p>My lapsed adventurer qualification certificate was also restored.</p>

<p>I thought there might be some commotion, but it was surprisingly settled as a procedural mistake.</p>

<p>The usual receptionist was very surprised, but she patted my head and told me she was glad I was alive. She spoke in polite language and didn't talk about anything other than business, so I felt a wall between us, but it seemed like she cared about me.</p>

<p>Well, I'm the weakest in the world, so it wouldn't be strange for people to always worry about when I might die.</p>

<p>When she patted my head, I felt a bit like little kid.</p>

<p>Why is it that receptionists are always beautiful in any industry?</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much!&quot;</p>

<p>I bowed my head and left the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>Then I headed to a shop with a beautiful exterior like a jewelry store.</p>

<p>A high-end shop located in a prime location in Tokyo was something I thought I would never be involved with.</p>

<p>The name of the shop was &quot;Forte.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a shop that stocked the highest quality equipment imbued with magic power.</p>

<p>Although Forte is an American brand, it&rsquo;s spread all over the world.</p>

<p>This is its Japanese branch, where people who can imbue magical power into material from monsters or metal, called weapon artisans, work.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow...I feel out of place...&quot;</p>

<p>As always, I, with the appearance of a fool in shorts, stood out among the clearers dressed in suits and cool equipment.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome--&quot;</p>

<p>The female clerk looked at me and gave me a look that said, &quot;Are you sure you're not in the wrong store?&quot; I thought the same thing.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh...I was introduced by Tanaka-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?...Ah, we've been waiting for you!! P-Please wait a moment!!&quot;</p>

<p>The female clerk's attitude changed in an instant when she heard my words.</p>

<p>This must be what it feels like for a fox to borrow the power of a tiger, or to present the general&rsquo;s seal box.*</p>

<p>I was introduced by Tanaka-san as the vice-president of the top guild in Japan, which means I'm a VIP among VIPs for the Forte brand.</p>

<p>Then, another clerk appeared in place of the woman.</p>

<p>He was a salesman wearing a gray suit, with a distinctive protruding front tooth.</p>

<p>He was rubbing his hands together so much that I wondered if he was trying to start a fire with them.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to meet you, Tenchi-sama. I'm the store manager, Nezu.&quot;</p>

<p>I received his business card and gave a vague response.</p>

<p>I never expected the store manager to come out. All I wanted was to see the equipment...</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard from Tanaka-san. So, what kind of weapon would you like? We have everything from staffs to short swords and hammers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, thank you. Then... a sword. Something like this.&quot;</p>

<p>I show the sword that was hanging from my waist.</p>

<p>It was a low-quality longsword that had been hastily enchanted with magic handed out by the country.</p>

<p>Despite that, I had been using it for almost half a year and it had become familiar in my hand.</p>

<p> &quot;It's a longsword, isn't it? They&rsquo;re our most popular item! Please feel free to look around the second floor for swords. If you'd like to pick one up, just let us know.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed like I was free to look around, which was good. I'm the type who likes to choose clothes on my own.</p>

<p>As I looked at the showcase of equipment that looked like decorations, I realized something.</p>

<p>&quot;I must have the best appraisal skill when it comes to weapons...&quot;</p>

<p>The weapon's status was displayed.</p>

<p>I had noticed this when I was observing clearers in Avalon's lobby.</p>

<p>It seems that I can see the status of humans, Cubes, and weapons made with magic.</p>

<p>For example, this sword</p>

<p>Type: Magic Weapon</p>

<p>Title: High Wolf&rsquo;s Fang Sword</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: C</p>

<p>Effect&#65306;+120 Attack Power</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>Using a High Wolf&rsquo;s fang, a sword forged of steel and highly pure magic power.</p>

<p>This High Wolf long sword is incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>I was staring at its particularly beautiful pure white blade in admiration.</p>

<p>Its stats are also excellent, and to be honest, I really want it.</p>

<p>Its attack power is +120, more than several times that of my long sword.</p>

<p>With this sword, do I have the strength of 120 people? Aren&rsquo;t I too weak?</p>

<p>There are, of course, even stronger weapons to be found, but I like this sword, so I think I'll try holding it.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, can I touch this High Wolf's Fang Sword?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you have a good eye. Although it doesn't state that it uses a fang, you knew well!&quot;</p>

<p>Then, Nezu-san took out the long sword from the showcase.</p>

<p>It does say High Wolf, but it doesn't say it's a fang.</p>

<p>I thought I messed up, but I'll just bluff my way through it as a good eye for detail.</p>

<p>I grip the sword, and it feels slightly lighter than what I'm used to, but it still has a sufficient weight.</p>

<p>It feels very comfortable to hold, and I feel like I could easily pierce a hobgoblin with it.</p>

<p>I can feel the power of +120 attack power. This is strength.</p>

<p>I check my own stats.</p>

<p>Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: None</p>

<p>Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p>Magic Power: 5</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1 +120</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=1</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>

<p>&#12539;High Wolf&rsquo;s fang sword = Attack Power +120</p>

<p>&quot;Is my status rising...?&quot;</p>

<p>It feels like my power has increased significantly just by equipping this item.</p>

<p>So, I checked my status and indeed it seems like my status has been increased.</p>

<p>Under the equipment section, it says my attack power has been increased by +120.</p>

<p>&quot;Even so, this is amazing...120, that's 24 times my magic power.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>Nezu-san, who was surprised by me muttering to myself, tilted his head and looked at me with a curious expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, nothing! This is a great sword! How much is it...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's 24 million yen. It's a great deal compared to others!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;HAa!?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p>

<p>24 million yen?! That's impossible!</p>

<p>If it was 1 million yen, I thought that would be just about right to buy, but this is just at a different level.</p>

<p>However, seeing my reaction, Nezu-san said something unbelievable.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahem! B-but all items are 90% off today only!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! 90% off!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's a clearance sale today. So, that sword will be 2.4 million yen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-that's an amazing deal!&quot;</p>

<p>(Is that really possible? A closing sale as well would be surprising.)</p>

<p>&quot;How about it? Do you like that sword?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yeah. But... it's still expensive. I can't afford it...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... excuse me, but what's your budget?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... I only have around 1 million yen...&quot;</p>

<p>Then, Nezu-san coughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahem! Sorry, that item was damaged, so it's 96% off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even with damage... 96% off!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's a special price for today only.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll buy it!&quot;</p>

<p>Although I felt like I might be tricked, I made a quick decision.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much!!&quot;</p>

<p>While thanking me with a loud voice I was bowed out by Nezu-san.</p>

<p>It was a big purchase for 960,000 yen. But I couldn't imagine a more bargain item than this. I felt like some kind of force was working behind the scenes, but I decided not to worry about it.</p>

<p>Somehow, the image of a nihilistic laughter with glasses flashed through my mind, but I decided to forget about it.</p>

<p>I left the store in high spirits.</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Tanaka. You made a purchase earlier for 24 million yen. Is everything satisfactory?&quot;</p>

<p>While watching Kai leave, Nezu contacted Tanaka outside the store.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, that&rsquo;s on the cheap end for your store. Anyway, if the person likes it, it's fine... I'll transfer the difference. It's surprising that it didn't get exposed. Or maybe he found out but kept it quiet. Haha, that's just like him. He should just accept it honestly. Thank you, you've been a big help.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, we didn't really do much to assist... But that boy, I can't believe that Tanaka-sama has such an eye for him... Could he possibly be S-Rank!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, no. He's unranked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unranked!? Then, is he the son of some wealthy family?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No? He's a poor boy who lives in a shabby apartment. He's a boy who belongs to the lower echelons of society, as the world generally says.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-That's...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My instincts...are telling me not to let him go. Haha, it's just a feeling, but I trust my judgment when it comes to people.&quot;</p>

<p>As Nezu listened to Tanaka's words, he gazed at the back of the young man in the distance, who seemed to have no outstanding qualities and was just an ordinary youth that could be found anywhere.</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;I made a great purchase! With this, I wonder if I can solo conquer an E-Rank dungeon?&quot;</p>

<p>I rubbed my cheek against the pure white sword that was so enchanting.</p>

<p>It was a longsword that was as white as snow.</p>

<p>However, it was sharper, harder, and lighter than steel.</p>

<p>It was so beautiful that I wanted to lick it, but I restrained myself since only delinquents from the Showa era licked swords on the street.</p>

<p>It was a privilege granted only to dungeon clearers like me to walk around town with a sword at my waist.</p>

<p>&quot;For now, let's go check on Nagi... I wonder if she's feeling lonely.&quot;</p>

<p>I headed straight to the hospital.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>When I arrived at the hospital and asked to visit, Ijuin-sensei came down and hugged me.</p>

<p>&quot;Ijuin-sensei!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I received a message from someone named Tanaka... I'm so glad you're alive... In this line of work, parting is always sudden, but you're the first one to come back to life. I'm really glad. Your death was reported all over Japan, even though it was just a mistake on the paperwork. No, I'm really glad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, sorry. I was bedridden at home for a week, and this happened.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave the excuse I had agreed upon with Tanaka.</p>

<p>After conquering the dungeon, I had been bedridden at home for a week due to fatigue and injury.</p>

<p>If someone scrutinized the details, they would realize it was a lie, but I figured I could just bull my way through.</p>

<p>Tanaka apparently had connections with important people at the association, so he said he would handle it well, so I left it up to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, and about Tanaka. He's a friend with amazing connections. Nagi-chan is doing well aside from not being able to move, but I'm sure she's very worried since she hasn't seen you for a week, so please go see her... Let me guide you.&quot;</p>

<p>I followed Ijuin-sensei as he took me to the top floor.</p>

<p>&quot;This is... amazing.&quot;</p>

<p>When I entered the room on the top floor, Nagi and a woman in her forties who seemed to be her caregiver were listening to something.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it was a space that was so comfortable that it could have been mistaken for a high-end hotel.</p>

<p>The woman noticed me and stood up to greet me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, hello. I'm Yamaguchi from the Avalon Guild. I'm here as a representative from an ASM exclusive care service company.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, thank you... I'm Nagi's older brother, Kai Amachi.&quot;</p>

<p>I was handed a business card at our first meeting. It seemed that this woman, Yamaguchi, in her forties was sent from a company that provided care exclusively for people who were unable to move due to ASM.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm taking care of Nagi-san in various ways. We've been asked to provide the highest level of service, so look! We're providing a reading service of shoujo manga. We have a lot of popular works prepared for women around this age! We also have everything from famous videos to movies!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, thank you. That's an amazing service...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mhm, well the only think I can do is at least continue to speak to her... Ah, then I'll go outside for a bit!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go back too, Kai-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying so, Yamaguchi-san and Professor Ijuin go outside.</p>

<p>Feeling grateful for their consideration, I head towards Nagi who I sit beside.</p>

<p>I don't even know if she's asleep or not, but her complexion looks good, and she seems to be just sleeping.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagi... Sorry, it's been a week since I last came because of various things.&quot;</p>

<p>I bring a chair next to Nagi and sit down.</p>

<p>I gaze at her and tidy up her hair that was blowing on her face in the wind.</p>

<p>It was the same as a week ago, just the face of my very cute little sister.</p>

<p>I wonder what Nagi's status is... She developed symptoms right after awakening, so we haven't even measured her magic power.</p>

<p>I activate my God's Eye and check Nagi's status.</p>

<p>And then I almost lose my balance.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>


<p>Name: Nagi Amachi</p>

<p>Status: Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis</p>

<p>Job: Magician (Healing) &#12304;Low Rank&#12305;</p>

<p>Skill(s): Healing Magic</p>

<p>Magic Power: 18750</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=4687</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=4687</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=4687</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=14062</p>


<p>&quot;Nagi...you. You're A-class, and a magician (healing) at that.&quot;</p>

<p>Scoring over 10,000 in magic power measurement.</p>

<p>That is considered an A-class awakened individual, known as a national power and among the world's most powerful.</p>

<p>Although she ranks among the lower tier of A-class, her power is still an overwhelming force in this world.</p>

<p>Furthermore, her occupation as a magician (healing) is a very rare and valuable asset, just like Midori-san.</p>

<p> Having seen a few awakened individuals, I realized that there are various professions such as magicians, weapon craftsmen, and swordsmen.</p>

<p>Among them, Nagi's profession is so rare that she can make a living for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Although not suitable for combat, she is a crucial presence to have in a party.</p>

<p>After checking Nagi's status, I realized that my little sister is far stronger than me.</p>

<p>&quot;Moreover...&quot;</p>

<p>The status indicated a condition called &quot; Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis.&quot;</p>

<p>Apparently, this eye can even inform the symptoms of diseases.</p>

<p>Humans should have given it that name, but come to think of it, they said something about adapting the library to the race of human.</p>

<p>I glared fiercely at those words, consciously focusing on them.</p>

<p>Then it appeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>A window-like status screen appeared in the air.</p>

<p>Alongside the words &quot;Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis,&quot; another pop-up appeared.</p>

<p>It was a detailed explanation.</p>

<p>Type: Disease</p>

<p>Title: Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: 1</p>

<p>Effect: Confusion of the mind</p>

<p>Explanation: A disease due to the depletion of magic power, thus nerves directed towards the muscles are unable to fulfill a connection.</p>

<p>Treatment method: Cannot be displayed due to an insufficient Access Right level.</p>

<p>It contained details about the still unknown details of Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis.</p>

<p>Including an item that cannot be seen yet: a treatment method.</p>

<p>Still, there&rsquo;re sections that can&rsquo;t be seen for now.</p>

<p> Translator notes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To present the general&rsquo;s seal box&rdquo;: Means to identify oneself as a person of high rank. In the Edo period generals carried around seal boxes with them called Inro (&#21360;&#31840;) that identified themselves.</p>
