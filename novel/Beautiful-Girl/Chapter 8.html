<h2>Chapter 26: Welcome to Avalon!</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>At the end of the voice, I sighed with relief and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Good, I can go home now... As soon as I get back...&quot;</p>

<p>I closed my eyes while holding my blood-dripping left arm.</p>

<p>&quot;I need to go to the hospital...&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I thought my vision went dark, I was in my usual home, staring at the ceiling. Fortunately, my smartphone was in my bag. I couldn't move another step, but I managed to muster up the last of my strength to turn on my smartphone from my bag.</p>

<p>I called Tanaka-san.</p>

<p>(Please... pick up... I can't take it anymore...)</p>

<p>My wish seemed to have come true when I heard a gentle voice as soon as the sound of the phone being picked up reached my ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, is that you, Kai? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad... I'm sorry, I'm about to die, please help me &#9472;&#9472; My address is...&quot;</p>

<p>I somehow managed to tell him my address and closed my eyes right away. I was sure Mr. Tanaka would do something about it.</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>I don't know how long it had been, but it felt incredibly long. I could hear some noises, but I couldn't tell what they were.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai! Midori, start the treatment right away! We need to take him to the hospital!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got it!!&quot;</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230; Is this the rumored unfamiliar ceiling?&quot;</p>

<p>I woke up on a hospital bed.</p>

<p>Bright red blood was connected to my body through tubes.</p>

<p>It seemed that I was being given a blood transfusion.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad... you're awake, Kai... I thought my heart was going to stop...&quot;</p>

<p>When I looked toward the voice, Mr. Tanaka was sitting there. He had left work halfway to be with me and was working on his PC in his suit next to me. I felt sorry for bothering him while he was busy.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for causing you trouble... but I'm glad you came right away. I was about to die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really, if it hadn't been for Midori's emergency treatment, you would have been in real danger. By the time we got there, you were almost dead... but I'm really glad... Ijuin-sensei said that the external injuries can be healed without any problems and that you don't need to be hospitalized since there's enough blood from the transfusion. But... the burn scars on your left leg won't disappear. Healing won't work because some cells are dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so... well, it's a badge of honor for a man!&quot;</p>

<p>I answered with a laugh.</p>

<p>I looked at my leg, and it did look like a burn scar, and I thought that it would stay with me for the rest of my life, but I didn't think it was worth worrying about, so I laughed it off.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230; You're strong. Midori was worried too, but she had another treatment today, so she went home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I need to thank her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought you'd say that, so I told her that you don't need to thank her. Midori is happy that she could repay the favor, so you don't have to worry about it. I wanted to ask you a lot of questions, but let's wait until you've calmed down. Rest for today. Let's go eat lunch tomorrow, you need to eat meat to replenish your blood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, I'm sorry. Please take care of me.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san gently stroked my head, smiled, and left the room.</p>

<p>Maybe it was due to exhaustion but, I fell asleep again.</p>

<p>&#9671; The next morning.</p>

<p>I slept so much that I felt completely refreshed.</p>

<p>In Nagi's hospital room, I talked about everything that had happened so far, even though I didn't get a response.</p>

<p>It was lonely not receiving any reaction, and maybe Nagi was still asleep.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, Nagi, I'm going. I think Yamaguchi-san will come to see you again, so hang in there a little longer.&quot;</p>

<p>I kissed Nagi on the forehead and left the hospital, having been granted permission to be discharged. I wanted to clean up the bloodstains at home, but the tatami mats that should have been stained with my blood had been replaced with new ones. It's probably Tanaka-san's doing; I should thank him.</p>

<p>I called Tanaka-san.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello? It's me, Kai!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, you've been discharged, huh? Is your body okay now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, thanks to you! And thank you for the tatami mats!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, it's fine. I thought about cleaning the room too, but that would be an invasion of privacy. About the promise we made yesterday, can you come to our office around 11 o'clock?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Roger that! I'm starving, I feel like I'm dying!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha! That's good, then. Give me a call when you get here.&quot;</p>

<p>I wondered if I should eat something, but Tanaka-san said he would treat me to something delicious.</p>

<p>It would be a waste to fill up beforehand, so I decided to endure it with just water in the spirit of frugality.</p>

<p>Since I was dirty, I took a shower and changed into a shirt. Although it was my usual Uniqlo clothing, I wondered if I looked like a businessman with black pants and a white cutter.</p>

<p>And then, I headed to Toranomon, where Tanaka-san's guild headquarters is located.</p>

<p>&quot;What will Tanaka-san say when I tell him everything...?&quot;</p>

<p>I was waiting in the lobby on the first floor of the Avalon headquarters.</p>

<p>It's called a guild, but it's just a corporation, a company in essence.</p>

<p>A company that deals with monsters and Cubes.</p>

<p>If the giant organization called the Dungeon Association, which is run by the country, is like the police, then I suppose the guilds are like security companies.</p>

<p>That being said, all the clearers belong to the Dungeon Association and also to a specific guild. In that sense, maybe it's similar to how doctors work &ndash; they obtain a national license and then work individually or in large hospitals.</p>

<p>Among them, Avalon is the largest guild in Japan and is also ranked in the top 20 worldwide. The majority of the top guilds in the world are in superpowers like China and America. Considering their military power and population, it's no surprise that their power is immense.</p>

<p>It's said that their magic power is on a different scale, and I'd love to see their stats once.</p>

<p>By the way, an S-class existence is one with a magic power of over 100,000. There might be someone with 1,000,000, but it's hard to imagine what kind of monster they would be.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, Kai-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san!&quot;</p>

<p>As I was waiting in the lobby, Tanaka-san came down. The floor was buzzing, but at least today I wasn't wearing shorts and a T-shirt, so I didn't feel embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;You look quite dashing today. ...Has your body changed? I didn't notice yesterday because you were in that state, but you've become quite impressive in just a month since we last met. Is it the influence of magic power?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san grabbed my shoulder and squeezed. In fact, I had been thinking the same thing &ndash; as my magical power increased, my body seemed to improve significantly from what used to be a beanpole-like figure. Maybe the fact that my abs started to show a bit is because I was working hard and eating more.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, I've become sturdier somehow...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It must be the effect of magic power. Our bodies are our assets, so it's a good thing. Let's put on more muscle then!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir!&quot;</p>

<p>I was taken by Tanaka-san to our destination. Where would he take me? Could it be a sushi place in Ginza?</p>

<p>After about a 10-minute walk, we reached a huge hotel a little away from the office district. It was a gigantic skyscraper, comparable to Tanaka-san&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, this is a fancy place. Is it a hotel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's my home. Its only merit is its height, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a condo? Rather, one of those billion-yen condos, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>What I thought was a hotel turned out to be a luxurious condominium. I followed Tanaka-san past the high-end hotel-like reception.</p>

<p>&quot;Honestly, the elevator is slow every morning, and it takes a while to even go to a convenience store. It's a hassle in more ways than one, just being tall. But since I hold a position, I need to live in a place that reflects my status, or my subordinates wouldn't respect me.&quot;</p>

<p>I understood that it was part of his image. Indeed, it would be disappointing if one's boss or the vice-president of the company lived in a shabby apartment. To inspire motivation in his subordinates, Tanaka-san has to live a dream-like lifestyle.</p>

<p>&quot;I used to be poor, so I can't really relax here. I actually feel more at home in a place like where you live. But I was fortunate to gain this power and make my way up. That's all there is to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san was being humble, but I knew his status was on the lower end of the A-rank. Even though it's rare, there are many stronger people out there. So, it wasn't just his magical power that got him to where he is today. It's his charisma and character that I have come to trust and rely on even though we haven't known each other for long.</p>

<p>You could also say that&rsquo;s having a good personality, I guess.</p>

<p>We passed through a dazzling lobby and took an elevator that seemed to climb endlessly, making me feel the pressure difference in the air.</p>

<p>The elevator had a window where people below appeared to be the size of grains of rice.</p>

<p>&quot;As expected, it's the top floor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The view is great, and I can use the rooftop too. Today, we'll have a barbecue up there, so no one will overhear our conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That sounds fantastic!&quot;</p>

<p>I entered Tanaka-san's home under his guidance.</p>

<p>Midori-san was living with him, but she wouldn't be home until late at night due to work.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never seen a spiral staircase inside a home before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lately, I've been just jumping down to save time.&quot;</p>

<p>With Tanaka-san's status, a height like this must be nothing for him.</p>

<p>The house was stylish, filled with unrecognizable paintings, art objects , and electronic devices. I didn't know what most of the items were, but that just showed how different our worlds were.</p>

<p>&quot;Can you help me? We sometimes have BBQs here with guild members.&quot;</p>

<p>He led me to a balcony. The space was well-prepared for barbecues, ready to start at any moment.</p>

<p>The BBQ felt like dining at a restaurant, comfortably grilling meat while seated. Although the summer sun was strong, the area was shaded, and a large fan dispersed the heat and smoke.</p>

<p>&quot;The meat is delicious and seems expensive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eat as much as you want. There's rice too; I bought too much.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and I enjoyed the BBQ while engaging in small talk. We talked about my home and Tanaka-san's past, each sharing our dark histories, but the meat helped us digest those heavy topics.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san had lost his parents in a dungeon collapse. They didn't get caught in it, but instead, they fought to protect the defenseless citizens and Tanaka-san until the very end.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I aimed to become an explorer too. I also wanted to know: What are the Cubes? What is this magic power that changed the world?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that why you joined the Golden Cube expedition, even though you're the vice president?&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haha, that&rsquo;s embarrassing. I got all fired up and like a child swatted down all of my subordinates&rsquo; objections and participated. &lsquo;Curiosity killed the cat,&rsquo; you know? I really did come this close to dying. I was only saved thanks to you.</p>

<p>While having that type of small-talk, I finally decided to admit the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san, may I talk to you about something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, anytime. I invited you here intending to listen to whatever you have to say.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san smiles while grilling the meat, probably to show that he wants me to feel free to talk. Relieved by his expression, I decide to tell him everything I've kept hidden about that day.</p>

<p>&quot;That day, I was teleported. After you all left, the monsters were released, and I closed my eyes. But when I opened them, I was in another room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then I was told that I had cleared the dungeon and, as a reward, I would be granted the &#12302;Eye of God&#12303;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You cleared it... So, your final choice wasn't wrong after all. And what is this &#12302;Eye of God&#12303;? It has quite an impressive name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, may I borrow a piece of paper and a pen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>I took the paper and pen from Tanaka-san, then read and wrote down his status. He looked at me curiously but waited silently.</p>

<p>&quot;With the power of the 'Eye of God' given to me by that voice, my perception of the world has changed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Eye of God... You mean, like the one in that mural?&quot;</p>

<p>What Tanaka-san recalls is the eye symbol in the center of the triangle drawn on the door. It's known as the Eye of Providence, a famous symbol representing the omnipotent eye of God.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and this is the power it granted me.&quot;</p>

<p>I showed Tanaka-san the paper with the written status.</p>

<p>&quot;No way...are you telling me...this is...&quot;</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>I wrote down Tanaka-san&rsquo;s status on paper and handed it to him.</p>


<p>Name: Issei Tanaka</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: Mage (Flame)&#12304;Advanced&#12305;</p>

<p>Skill(s): Fireball, Firewall</p>

<p>Magic Power: 23,450</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=5,863</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=5,863</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=5,863</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;100%=23,450</p>


<p>&quot;23,450... This is the magic power value I measured with a magic power measurement device. I didn't publicize it, and I shouldn't have told you, Kai-kun. And the skill names? That's ridiculous...&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san mutters something while holding the paper with both hands, looking at it. I was feeling a bit awkward while observing Tanaka-san's reaction.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, you can see this? Everyone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes, and there are also statuses for these weapons, and for the Cubes too.&quot;</p>

<p>I showed Tanaka-san the High Wolf&rsquo;s Fang Sword. I explained that I could tell just by looking at it that it belonged to the High Wolf.</p>

<p>&quot;W-Wait a moment. I can't keep up. You mean there are statuses not only for people, but also for weapons and Cubes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yeah, and for monsters too. Probably everything that&rsquo;s affected by magic power.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san leans back, looking up at the sky.</p>

<p>&quot;Then, you can understand the strength of monsters, the performance of weapons, and the state of Cubes all as numerical values?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a... beyond imagination. I thought I was prepared for anything you could say, but this power could change the world.&quot;</p>

<p>And then I decided to talk about the most difficult thing.</p>

<p>&quot;...So, this is probably the most surprising thing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? There's more...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are two types of Cube clearances, clear and complete clear. You can also receive rewards. Once a Cube has been cleared, you can't receive a reward for clearing it again... but complete clearances are rarely done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Complete clear?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, each Cube has specific conditions, like clearing it solo or defeating 100 goblins. By completing these clearances, you'll be rewarded with... an increase in your maximum magic power.&quot;</p>

<p>At my words, Tanaka-san stands up.</p>

<p>&quot;...There were rumors that some people got stronger after clearing a Cube... is that it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Probably...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... is that all? I'm already full.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's still more if we go into the details, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha... Let's hear everything then.&quot;</p>

<p>I explained everything, including the dungeon collapse, class upgrades, access permissions, and my current understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>And my goal as well.</p>

<p>&quot;AMS... the details of the disease that is eating at the world...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's why I want to increase my power and gain access to the details of AMS. I don't know the method. But I feel like the dungeons, or those Cubes, hold the solution.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To achieve that, you'll clear the dungeons solo and become stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>I conveyed my feelings directly to Tanaka-san.</p>

<p>Clearing dungeons solo is unimaginably dangerous.</p>

<p>I know that better than anyone, having experienced near-death situations so many times in such a short period.</p>

<p>That's why the Dungeon Association was created, why guilds were established, and why the dungeon point system was put in place for entering dungeons.</p>

<p>I'm saying that I will break through that; I have no right to complain even if my clearance qualifications are revoked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's extremely dangerous to go solo. You might die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm prepared for that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka and I stared at each other with serious expressions.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, Tanaka couldn't help but laugh.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Hehe, haha. If you say you're prepared, I have no choice but to believe you. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned anyways...&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka was probably referring to that time when I faced the Trial of the Heart.</p>

<p>Indeed, at that time, I was prepared to die to save everyone's lives.</p>

<p>Of course, there was some calculation involved, knowing that Nagi would be helped.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's useless to try to stop you, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;I really should stop you. But&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka grabbed my hand.</p>

<p>And looked at me again with the same expression.</p>

<p>&quot;There must be a reason why you were given that power. So, I will at least support you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And, about that power. You shouldn't tell others. Only you should use that power to become stronger. Let me be clear, if misused, that power could change the world, and malicious forces may come after you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does that mean&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In Japan, if the opponent is Japanese, my guild and this country can protect you. But&#8230; you probably know. Somebody who might be your potential adversary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A superpower?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka quietly nodded.</p>

<p>This power, which could upset the world's power balance, might not be fully protected even with the power of Japan.</p>

<p>China, America, Russia, Asia, and Western powers.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, Japan&rsquo;s strength, a middle-ranking nation, is the strength of its clearers.</p>

<p>What would happen to my future in such a situation?</p>

<p>I could end up being silenced, turned into a mere appraisal machine.</p>

<p>My eyes could be gouged out, or I could be killed, considered a dangerous existence.</p>

<p>Just imagining it was terrifying.</p>

<p>The force called the world would not allow a small person like me to resist.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why you should become at least an S-Rank, a representative attacker of Japan. Then, there will be fewer people who can harm you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me, an S-Rank!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, I will support you. Due to the dungeon points, entering dungeons alone is basically impossible. Due to that, you've been soloing countryside Cubes, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Yes, I was breaking the rules.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, so let's break the rules together. We'll have to make a false application to the association. I can do it without getting caught, and I won't leave any evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that&#8230; okay? It would be bad if we got caught.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, it's a criminal act. But sometimes, there are things that should be protected more than the rules. I believe in you, and I'm sure now that it's my justice. I have a vague idea of why that power was given to you.&quot;</p>

<p>I stood up and bowed my head.</p>

<p>I knew it wasn't a small matter for someone in Tanaka's position to break the rules.</p>

<p>Even so, I decided to rely on him.</p>

<p>Because there are things that I should protect more than the rules.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Understood. Thank you very much!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, leave it to me. So, now you can say it properly.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka stood up and grabbed my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome to my guild, Avalon. We welcome you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? I'm a member of Avalon!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, just be affiliated. It will be more convenient in various ways. I'll arrange for you to be able to solo some D-Rank dungeons tomorrow. The lower ranks of C-Rank should be just right for you. You want to get to the dungeon as soon as possible, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, you've figured it out? Actually, I'm putting on a cool front, saying it's for my family, but I'm really enjoying it right now. I also want to try out my new power.</p>

<p>Having Tanaka-san see right through me made me a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>This being for Nagi is completely true, so I&rsquo;m not lying.</p>

<p>But even still, clearing dungeons is fun and I can really grasp that feeling of achievement while I grow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand, the dungeon is a man&rsquo;s romance. Alongside that, you can grow. There&rsquo;s no way that wouldn&rsquo;t be enjoyable. Well, my stomach&rsquo;s full and we talked about all there is to talk about. Let&rsquo;s end it here for today. I&rsquo;ll contact you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in your care!&rdquo;</p>

<p> In that way, Tanaka-san and I both ended our meeting on that day.</p>

<p>Having been able to have that very profitable conversation, from here on out I&rsquo;ll have support from Tanaka-san so I can complete what I need to without having to go to the countryside.</p>

<p>Well, I say that, but to not be found out, the amount of time I spend operating at night increased.</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>The next day, at night.</p>

<p>I headed to the location Tanaka told me about.</p>

<p>A little further from Tokyo, closer to Chiba, there was a Cube.</p>

<p>I was on my way to a D-Rank dungeon, which was originally supposed to be cleared by another team from Avalon.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you're here. Let's get started. I thought I'd watch your first time. By the way, what's the status of this Cube?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka was waiting there by himself.</p>

<p>It was late at night, and there were no people around &ndash; it was actually sealed off because the dungeon was close to collapsing.</p>

<p>It seems that sealing off the area until the dungeon is cleared is also part of the Dungeon Association's job.</p>

<p>Clearers are always in short supply. With so many Cubes in Japan alone, it's inevitable that they must be cleared regularly.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's see...&quot;</p>

<p>I checked the status of the white Cube and informed Tanaka.</p>


<p>Remaining magic power&#65306;80/100&#65288;+1/24hr&#65289;</p>

<p>Clear Difficulty&#65306;D-Rank</p>

<p>&#9670;Reward</p>

<p>First Clear Reward&#65288;Complete&#65289;&#65306;Magic Power +50</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition(s) 1&#12288;While not having been cleared before, defeat the boss.</p>

<p>Complete Clear Reward&#65306;Current access level is unable to display this.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;Clear while solo.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 2&#12288;Clear without taking any damage.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 3&#12288;Defeat every monster inside the dungeon. (Currently 97)</p>


<p>&quot;I see, those conditions. And it's completely different for each Cube. You wouldn't notice that, would you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and in today's world, clearing a dungeon solo is strictly forbidden...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. Well, go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>With that, Tanaka patted my shoulder and saw me off.</p>

<p>I touched the Cube and dived into it with a clear sound. As my vision went dark and I opened my eyes, I found myself in...</p>

<p>&quot;...a forest?&quot;</p>

<p>Lush trees, the sound of a babbling brook, and the chirping of insects.</p>

<p>It seemed like an unusual type for a dungeon.</p>

<p>It was almost like the Amazon, not that I've ever been there.</p>

<p>Everything was huge &ndash; the trees were big, and so was the grass.</p>

<p>The sunlight was bright, and it was hot and humid.</p>

<p>I was glad I was dressed casually, and since I had food and water in my bag, I should be fine for a while.</p>

<p>The temperature felt like it could cause dehydration.</p>

<p>And then, right in front of me...</p>

<p>&quot;Wow... a huge spider.&quot;</p>

<p>I stared at the status of something that looked like a white spider clinging to a tree.</p>

<p>Honestly, it was disgusting. I'm more resistant to insects due to my poverty, and as for cockroaches, they're like roommates, but big bugs are still creepy.</p>

<p>By the way, small spiders are called beneficial insects, so when I see them at home, I say, &quot;Thank you for your hard work today.&quot;</p>


<p>Name: White Spider</p>

<p>Magic Power: 50</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;20%=10</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;10%=5</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;40%=20</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;30%=15</p>


<p>&quot;&#8230;So, it's white. It's nice that the strength can be determined by color, just like the Cubes.&quot;</p>

<p>An E-Rank dungeon's Blue Bear.</p>

<p>A D-Rank dungeon's White Spider.</p>

<p>And as they get stronger, Red and Yellow monsters appear, just like the Cubes' colors.</p>

<p>Of course, there are also monsters that don't follow this concept at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, since I'm here, let's give it a try.&quot;</p>

<p>I picked up a rock that had fallen to the ground and threw it at the White Spider.</p>

<p>Whether it was angry about being hit by the rock or not, its numerous eyes stared at me intently.</p>

<p>It suddenly rushed towards me with a disgustingly fast speed.</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;Mirage.&quot;</p>

<p>What activated was my new skill.</p>

<p>The spider, which had run full speed towards me, stopped in its tracks and looked around, seemingly losing sight of me.</p>

<p>I quietly moved around to its back without making a sound, raised my sword, and then.</p>

<p>Zushaa!</p>

<p>&quot;GIIIII!&quot;</p>

<p>The insect, now split in half by my sword, let out a dying scream and perished.</p>

<p>A disgusting green liquid stuck to my pristine white sword.</p>

<p>&quot;It really couldn't see me, huh? This is&#8230; too convenient.&quot;</p>

<p>The skill I used was Mirage.</p>

<p>It was the extraordinary power given to me after clearing the novice knight exam.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I checked my own status.</p>


<p>Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: Novice Knight (Light)&#12304;Beginner&#12305;</p>

<p>Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p>Magic Power: 385</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;50%=192</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=96</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=96</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;50%=192</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;High Wolf&rsquo;s Fang Sword = Attack Power +120</p>


<p>As a result of obtaining this profession, my reflection rate for magic power increased.</p>

<p>My attack power and intelligence, which were at 25%, rose to 50%, an increase of 25%.</p>

<p>In total, that's a 50% increase.</p>

<p>It seems that a profession allows one to reflect magic power into one's status more efficiently. Tanaka-san's overall increase rate was 75% with 100% intelligence since he had the advanced profession of a mage.</p>

<p>I wonder if advanced professions get a 75% increase?</p>

<p>I'll try to pay more attention to the people around me next time.</p>

<p>&quot;Looking at it this way, I've gotten considerably stronger...&quot;</p>

<p>Now, my attack power is higher than that of the High Wolf's Fang Sword.</p>

<p>I'll need to consider getting new equipment sometime.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there was a good weaponsmith... maybe I should look for someone whose profession is a weaponsmith?</p>

<p>My 24-million-yen equipment is starting to feel slightly insufficient.</p>

<p>It's a luxurious problem compared to my past self, but as a C-Rank, I'd like to have B-Rank equipment or, if possible, custom-made ones...</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, they really don't notice me at all... These bugs have low intelligence, so they probably can't see me. I can use this as much as I want. I really got a great skill.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying that, I continued to hunt the bugs relentlessly.</p>

<p>It's one-sided; they're not even putting up a fight.</p>

<p>I repeatedly strike them down as if I were an invisible man from behind.</p>

<p>&#12302;Condition 2 has been achieved.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? I've defeated them all, huh. Now only the boss is left.&quot;</p>

<p>I activated Mirage and headed for the boss room.</p>

<p>In the center was a gigantic spider, the boss of the White Spiders, the Big White Spider.</p>

<p>It was at least twice as large as me.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>&quot;The boss doesn't notice me either...&quot;</p>

<p>I slowly walked up beside it and cut off its head with a single strike.</p>

<p>A disgusting cross-section and blood sprayed out, and an emotionless voice announced my complete clear.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>Two weeks have passed since then.</p>

<p>I've cleared the D-Rank dungeon late at night twice a day, nearly 30 times in total.</p>

<p>Mirage's power was overwhelming, and I was even feeling unsatisfied.</p>

<p>To be honest, it was just too easy.</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san, I'm thinking about challenging a C-Rank dungeon soon.&quot;</p>

<p>I was discussing this with Tanaka-san in his room, wearing the Avalon guild badge, fully as a guild member.</p>

<p>Just wearing this guild badge earns respect, it's like a general's insignia.</p>

<p>&quot;Two weeks, huh? Isn't it too soon? I admit you've become stronger, but the difficulty level increases significantly from C-Rank onwards.&quot;</p>

<p>I was consulting Tanaka-san about this.</p>

<p>Honestly, clearing D-Rank dungeons has become monotonous, and I think my growth has slowed.</p>

<p>After all, even after clearing one, my magic power only increases by 100.</p>

<p>That said, my senses may be getting numb considering that I originally only had a magic power of 5.</p>

<p>If I want to catch up with Tanaka-san, I'll have to clear nearly 300 dungeons.</p>

<p>This would involve not only dungeons in Japan but also those overseas.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do my best. So, please!&quot;</p>

<p>I pleaded with Tanaka-san with all my might.</p>

<p>However, Tanaka-san's expression was not very promising.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, okay... but there's one condition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before that, this is a bit of a change of subject, but I've upgraded your qualification as a clearer to C-Rank. I've explained it as a rare phenomenon where magic power grows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. Understood.&quot;</p>

<p>When people who have completely cleared the cube, or people who have cleared a dungeon for the first time without knowing become stronger than before is called magic power growth, due to it seeming as if their magic power has grown.</p>

<p>However, no matter how many cubes you clear, magic power does not grow in principle.</p>

<p>Although it is a very rare phenomenon, it is observed at a certain rate, so there is such a system in place.</p>

<p>&quot;C-Rank is quite handy... and actually, I have a favor to ask.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it...?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san took out some documents from his desk with a sly smile.</p>

<p>There was information about the clearer and a photo of a woman.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to clear a C-Rank dungeon as a member of Avalon. You've never been in a C-Rank dungeon before, have you? It's a good opportunity to get a feel for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a good idea. Then it's safe. Is that what you want?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san's suggestion was to dive into a C-Rank dungeon, which I had never entered, as part of a party.</p>

<p>I accepted the suggestion.</p>

<p>It is certainly safer to clear a C-Rank dungeon once with a party to see what it's like than to go solo right away.</p>

<p>However, this clear seemed to be no ordinary one.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, actually, we have a special request. They want us to escort someone who is going to dive into the dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An escort... that's unusual. Is it some rich person? There are some eccentric people who want to go into a dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. And this is the woman.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying this, Tanaka-san showed me a photograph.</p>

<p>&quot;A high school student? She's extremely beautiful... I feel like I've seen her somewhere...&quot;</p>

<p>I look at the photo.</p>

<p>Long black hair, a beautiful posture, and a great figure.</p>

<p>Whether it's her slanted eyes, or her eye power, her sharp gaze is enough to make anyone nervous just by looking at it.</p>

<p>Honestly, I thought she was incredibly beautiful, and her all-black uniform made my heart skip a beat.</p>

<p>But it seems like I've seen her somewhere before...</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know the President of the Japan Dungeon Association, Keiko Ryuuenji-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, she was an S-Rank explorer who defined an era. He&rsquo;s my, no, all explorers' idol. The videos of him smashing monsters with his fists are always exhilarating to watch, he&rsquo;s a master of martial arts. But I heard he has retired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, he&rsquo;s over 70 now, but honestly, he's still full of energy. I'd probably be overpowered by him with one hand. He wanted to delve into the dungeon, so every day we all had to desperately try to stop him.&quot;</p>

<p>As he spoke, Tanaka-san seemed to be acquainted with the president.</p>

<p>He looked up with a nostalgic look in his eyes. I wonder what happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me. So, this girl. Her name is Aya Ryuuenji. In other words, she's the president's granddaughter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His granddaughter!? Isn't that super VIP!?&quot;</p>

<p>The President of the Japan Dungeon Association, in other words, the most influential person in Japan when it comes to dungeons.</p>

<p>Keiko Ryuuenji, who also built a vast fortune as an S-Rank, and his granddaughter, Aya.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she graduated from high school this year and turned 18. So, she's the same age as you. She obtained an clearer&rsquo;s qualification. She wants to try delving into a dungeon... so she requested our guild to accompany her. She's interested in magic power and conducts cutting-edge research even as a high school student.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... that's a great responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I thought about sticking with B-Rank, but she said that would be against the rules... haha. She's a strong-willed young lady. She's really Keiko's granddaughter.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Tanaka-san, she requested to form a team according to the dungeon point system.</p>

<p>She wants to clear the dungeon, not to be guarded.</p>

<p>So, apparently, she chose to at least clear a C-Rank dungeon.</p>

<p>B-Rank is truly dangerous and not a place to enter for the first time.</p>

<p>Therefore, it seems that they decided to guard her with the top three C-Ranks and one B-Rank according to the dungeon point system.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to go there too. To put it bluntly, you are exceeding C-Rank now, and I think you are the most suitable for this case. It's killing two birds with one stone, and you may get known to the granddaughter. It's like hitting the jackpot, right? And she's super beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, understood.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to accept, chuckling at Tanaka-san's somewhat fatherly words.</p>

<p>As long as we can safely clear the C-Rank dungeon with veterans, I have no reason to refuse.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, what's the rank of the granddaughter... Aya, was it?&quot;</p>

<p>If she needs a guard, she must be D-Rank or maybe around C-Rank, right?</p>

<p>Then, Tanaka-san spit out unbelievable words.</p>

<p>&quot;...S-Rank... magic power level... a monster with 320,000.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Does she really need a guard?&quot;</p>

<p>I inadvertently let out a sarcastic remark.</p>
