<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Ren.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the lunch break, I was having lunch in the courtyard because of the invitation from Kyoya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This courtyard is a den of normies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is the first time I have ever come here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawn was wide, there were wooden tables and benches.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite comfortable, a convenient place to come by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than the fact that there are many normies here, it might be a good place to come to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, did something happen?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No&#8230;I mean,  you seem much better. Your usually dark aura is quite thin now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s just your imagination.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t lie to me, you really think I won’t notice?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if you say that, there is nothing to notice.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a lie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since that incident in the aquarium, something has been changing little by little inside of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was quite annoying that Kyoya saw through it immediately. He’s quite sharp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Tachibana-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Who is that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…You’re too bad at deceiving others” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I accidentally blurted out something dumb.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A place where you could just guess something in a single try is really a normie’s den.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was too accurate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, something did happen after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…It’s nothing, I just changed my way of thinking a little.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OK, NOW THAT’S A BIG DEAL FOR REN”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya looked unexpectedly surprised and suddenly jumped up with a piece of bread in his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn’t overacting, his eyes had lit up in excitement.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is rather sultry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought it was weird because you didn’t mind me inviting you to the courtyard. I was wondering if you were sleepwalking.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean?! So, Tachibana-san is the reason? Does it feel good? Going out with her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not like that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then what is it? What happened with you both? Are you going to leave out your best friend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya kept coming closer and clung to my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interaction between a famous person like Kyoya and a mob like me is very unusual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gazes of people came onto us mercilessly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t really mind the stares, but Kyoya was beginning to annoy me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I’ll make some parts a bit blurry and talk about it to a certain extent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This&#8230; Tachibana-san&#8230;&#8230; what a good girl…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I gave a rough explanation that sounded detailed when heard the first time, Kyoya held his chest as if he were thrilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This guy is an idiot after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that may as well be a good thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And Ren…you grew up…Aoooo”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don&#8217;t cry, you idiot”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to cry, I’m so happy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya had a face of a parent rejoicing in the rehabilitation of a bad child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you either praise me or tease me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He probably doesn’t mean to be so humiliating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, what about Tachibana-san?! Are you 2 going out?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not going out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why not?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KYOYA shouted angrily, seeming extremely disappointed.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I glared at him while covering my ears, he sat down with a big sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tachibana-san like you! I’m sure she loves you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t think so. She’s such a beautiful girl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have a chance because you are so close with such a beautiful girl.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We don’t have that type of relationship, we’re just friends” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ren is an idiot”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I could even finish speaking. Kyoya said such a thing.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He raised the corners of his mouth to a grin showing his teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then took off his shoes and crouched on the bench while holding his knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’ve never had a girlfriend, have you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that I’m unhappy to answer, but the look on his face was really annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, even if I haven’t, what about it?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really don’t know what normies are thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have a lot of friends, regardless of gender. And if you ask me, Ren…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Tachibana-san and you are not friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Why is that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Friends with opposite genders are not that close, simple as that.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That depends on the person. And Tachibana and I don’t get along that well, not really.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in my retort, Kyoya didn’t seem frightened the least. Rather, he had a victorious smile on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a smile that looked like it could eat others, but still friendly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was Kyoya’s weapon, something I didn’t have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, it’s different for each person. But you and Tachibana, both are not the type of people who get along with the opposite sex.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Don’t decide that by yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not deciding. I don’t know about Tachibana-san, but I do know about you. I am your best friend after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Shut up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ehh?!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I strongly pushed Kyoya who was crouching.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya, who lost his balance, narrowly avoided falling by being caught by the benches backrest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, he has good athletic skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you doing?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a warning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was scary!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya shouted as he sat back down and wore his shoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seemed to have learnt his lesson.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though my way of thinking has changed a little, I can withstand such a high level of prying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230;it was a good thing, actually.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Don’t be so grim.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A double date is not a dream anymore!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go and sleep for the rest of your life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He really hasn’t given up, has he?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have always loathed the word “Bochi”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bocchi&#8221; means a person who has no friends is always alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It stands for &#8220;Hitoribocchi&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s quite easy to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why did I suddenly stop hating it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason is quite simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just don’t care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to this end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if &#8220;Bocchi&#8221; is a bad word, those who think so can do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have friends who accept me the way I am.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I think like that, I stop caring what other people may think about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all because of Tachibana that I&#8217;ve been able to become like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m trying to go through the back of the gym to go home because it’s a shortcut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; Hmm?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry for calling you so suddenly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, it’s alright, so what can I do for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, come on…are you serious?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reflexively hide in the shadows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the exact same situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the place I was hiding was the same place I was hiding before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this time, I could tell who it was by the voice.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Tachibana who had just responded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tone was as cold as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she’s really popular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if she’s been confessed by more people than I know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’ve always liked you, Tachibana-san. Please go out with me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: In Japanese, people don’t really use “you” but the name instead. It sounds weird in English, so I’ve added the “you” many places in the novel. Yes, I know, pretty late to tell you that.) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This student seemed to be composed unlike the previous one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My senses reacted strongly to his calmness and confidence.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is probably a pretty popular guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a similar aura to Kyoya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, unlike the last time, I went to take a look outside the shadow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know it’s not a good idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it can’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just happened to be there by chance, it was just an irresistible compulsion, yes, an irresistible compulsion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I refuse, goodbye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single cut just like last time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rika Tachibana is one great swordsman.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I noticed that I was strangely relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is this weird feeling?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh…I see…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was relieved that the boy didn’t go crazy like the previous one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the most natural way to think of it, yeah, that’s it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;If it’s alright, can you at least tell me the reason?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because I don’t like you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clingy normie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his demeanor has been soft and calm throughout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, he’s different from the last one I saw.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so&#8230;damn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just get it over with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve already been turned down, just give up gracefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s Tachibana who has to decide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s completely irrelevant to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just why am I so frustrated?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I refuse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see. I understand. Thanks for thinking about it, really.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana bowed her head, and the other person also surprisingly returned a deep bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After raising his head at almost the same time, the other person turned around and left with a firm step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Tachibana, was she really this popular…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;AH!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard my name getting called, I accidentally let out a small shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, I couldn’t pretend that something wasn’t wrong, so I stepped out of my hiding place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…What are you doing? It’s bad manners.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn’t matter, you’ve already seen it before.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you going home now? Then let’s go together.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-ah yes…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike me, who couldn’t hide the awkwardness, Tachibana’s attitude was calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose she’s used to these things already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We left the school gate together and started walking towards our home side-by-side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was walking a little slower than Tachibana for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speaking of which, did you submit the report for the field trip properly?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? No…not yet.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s better to finish troublesome things first.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;oh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;You’re not being yourself, what’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, no, it&#8217;s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tachibana asked me that, it was quite obvious I was troubled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn’t something in particular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just that I feel a little uncomfortable.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I don’t understand something, how can I explain it to someone?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to cover it up for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;It’s nothing” (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;well, alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;By the way, did you know that guy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; ‘that guy’?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know…that guy who just…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah, I have talked to him a bit, but we are not close.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I see”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No… I mean, was it alright? He seemed like a nice guy, unlike the last person, and he was good-looking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You saw everything, right? Then you should know why I refused.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Mmm, Good then, I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-what? Why not?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because&#8230;it makes me feel uncomfortable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uncomfortable? Why is that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t know. That’s enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana pouted as she said that and shut up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lost my interest in pursuing the matter and thought of deciding what to write in my report, where I hadn’t written a single word yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;No, nothing, forget it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t “forget” it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for some reason, I felt it would be better to do so.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the next day, the weird uncomfortable feeling didn’t leave my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it wasn’t really interfering with my everyday life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t pay any attention to it and went through my classes normally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school, I was scolded by the homeroom teacher, I quickly finished writing a report of the field trip and submitted it to the staff room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had only seen the aquarium tanks, and I had been through quite a bit that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I couldn’t write a proper report.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I am good at writing these kinds of things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content was probably not so bad as to make the teachers offended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked through the hallway, which I don’t normally do. I went to the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was really quiet, probably because of club activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seriously, don’t get carried away, will you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could hear the voice clearly because of the quietness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don’t get carried away just because Ichinose-kun confessed to you.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Apologize to Yumi who like Ichinose-kun.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a vexing voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A childish and vicious voice, as if her first priority is to hurt the other person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t seem to know this Ichinose-kun or recognize any voice, so I hurried along as to not get involved with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t see them from where I was standing. They were probably at the bottom of the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can just walk past…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no other choice than to go down from the other staircase, though it was a bit of a detour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems everyone was busy with their love lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t care about love, as I’ve just started making friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll just walk past them, that’s what I was thinking when,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that all you want to say?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard a voice I really didn’t want to hear in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came here because you said there was something you wanted to say. So tell me what you want then. Don’t just shout your frustration and resentment on me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?! What are you saying now?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Damn you! Yumi is so hurt!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it wasn’t just her voice.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cold tone, her way of speaking…it was definitely Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from the situation, The handsome normie from yesterday was Ichinose, and these girls were his followers who held resentment towards Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The handsome guy was a decent guy, but his surroundings were troublesome…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation doesn’t look good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…It looks really bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From their voices, there were 2 or more of them against Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, Tachibana was by herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean Tachibana is a type of person who’ll just accept these unreasonable things being forced upon her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This…don’t be this unreasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn, just my luck…</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Tachibana is here, I won’t be able to just pass through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still owe her for peeking at her confession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I feel sorry for Ichinose-kun, to be deceived by such a dark person who only has good looks.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. You have a terrible personality, go apologize to Ichinose-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t care what you think about my inner or outer self, but we have already talked it between us. I have no reason to listen to you, being a third party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana is not fazed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary, the two of them were clearly hesitant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think she’ll need help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s disgusting when you say something like that after hurting someone.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that I hurt him. But he knew what would happen and told me how he felt. I gave him my answer, and the conversation ending for both of us in a satisfactory way. This is all that happened yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? H-huh?! W-what are you saying?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it with you? If you dislike me so much, say it directly, instead of using some ridiculous justifications for your actions. You people have no shame. And how do you even dare to use another person’s feelings for your own resentment.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh… Just Shut up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TWACK! There was a loud sound and the voice from below stopped.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.4</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly stood up involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed my position and looked over below the stairs without making a noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana seemed to have been slapped on the face by one of the girls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, whose cheek was not swollen, didn’t look away from the girl and was staring at her with her back straight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I don’t interfere, Tachibana will be fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary, if I do interfere and stop them, they might return a second or third time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if they think they can’t win against Tachibana, then this harassment will probably be repeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;are you done now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Uhh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you’re done, I’m leaving. Well then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tachibana was the complete victim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did nothing wrong.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is completely unreasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t seem to want help, is it alright to just stand by and watch?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh…? Wait!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;You still have to say something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You just have a pretty face. All the boys who approach you are only interested in your face!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s right”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A completely childish attack on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for some reason, Tachibana’s words didn’t have the same demeanor as before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that the other girls also noticed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two girls got better and started to curse at Tachibana together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess it’s now my time to act…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everyone hates girls like you, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! If the boys knew about your personality, they would hate you as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Takeda-sensei! There is a lot of commotion going on here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From above the stairs, I shouted while plucking my nose.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is my special magic. Takeda summoning Jutsu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect of this Jutsu seemed to be great this time as well. The girls ran down the stairs like bugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Tachibana stood there and looked at me who was on top of the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, my true identity had been revealed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The summoning failed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I decided to stop overthinking and intervene like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking so, Tachibana quickly escaped and went down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt wrong to force her to go together, so I went home slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I had no intention of following her.</span></p>
