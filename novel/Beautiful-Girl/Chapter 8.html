<p><h2>Chapter 8: Potions Class Field Training 1</h2></p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4></p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey, why don&rsquo;t you call me by my first name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the sudden question from my childhood friend Saitou, who I was walking to school with.</p>

<p>That day as well, he was stuffing his cheeks with umeboshi onigiri for breakfast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known each other for ten years now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because...Saitou is Saitou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with that excuse? I don&rsquo;t really like being called Saitou, you know. There&rsquo;s three Saitous at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well...Oda&rsquo;s like that too. It&rsquo;s a very common family name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Kazuha.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, stop that! I don&rsquo;t really like my name all that much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to read, you know? ...People misread it as &lsquo;Ichika&rsquo; a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm...that&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason, ever since I was little, my name never felt right.</p>

<p>My name was often misread, but it was given to me by my father arbitrarily, and my mother apparently didn&rsquo;t agree to it. That was why even now, she didn&rsquo;t call me by it much.</p>

<p>A name that isn&rsquo;t called was just symbols to be written on a test.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call your good friend Tanaka-san by her last name too, don&rsquo;t you? Why don&rsquo;t you call your best friend by her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tanaka-san tells me that a lot too. But it feels...kinda intimidating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The closer you are to someone, the more it seems like calling their name is like some kind of contract.</p>

<p>Like a vow...like a promise...</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it more comfortable for you to call me by my last name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As expected, Saitou, who has known me for a long time, understood me well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Then, it can&rsquo;t be helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Saitou seemed a bit lonely.</p>

<p> &#12295;</p>

<p>I dreamed of my past life.</p>

<p>A dream of my childhood friend, where we called each other by our commonplace surnames but couldn&rsquo;t even call each other by our first names.</p>

<p>No, I was the one who didn&rsquo;t try to call him that. The current me didn&rsquo;t understand at all why I back then was such a coward, but in any case, I didn&rsquo;t like my own name, I didn&rsquo;t like being called by it, and I was afraid to call other people&rsquo;s names.</p>

<p>Oda Kazuha.</p>

<p>No matter how much time passed, it never felt right. My name.</p>

<p>But that didn&rsquo;t mean I had to call everyone else by their last names. I was a little upset at my past life self for never calling the boy I liked by his name properly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The weather on the day of the &ldquo;Potions Class&rdquo; off-campus field training was very good.</p>

<p>We first-years left Lune Ruschia Magic School and headed by boat towards an island that was very close to it.</p>

<p>It was the small Third Medicinal Herb Garden Island, owned by Lune Ruschia Magic School. Here, the plants necessary for potions were grown in their natural state, and it was often used for students&rsquo; field training.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, all of you. Off-campus field training always goes hand-in-hand with danger. Even if you don&rsquo;t watch where you step and fall off a cliff, drown in a river, get torn to pieces by savage beasts, or killed by the people we have laid in place, the school will not be held responsible for anything. It&rsquo;s your fault for not paying attention!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Okay! Thank you for your words, Professor Lila of Magical Athletics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Potions classes operated together with Magical Athletics. For that reason, Professor Lila and Professor Medite took turns to explain to the gathered students at the beach.</p>

<p>Professor Medite showed a medicinal herb to the students.</p>

<p>It was a typical pteridophyte* with numerous feather-shaped leaves.</p>

<p> (TN: A pteridophyte is a type of plant that releases spores. Ferns are a type of pteridophyte.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you can see, this is a &lsquo;ponsida.&rsquo; Your task is to pick these and work together with your team to make the &lsquo;Pon eye drops&rsquo;, just as I taught you last class. The time limit is five hours. When all the members of your team return here within the time limit and submit the Pon eye drops, the task is finished. Cheating is not allowed. For example, if you submit store-bought Pon eye drops...the professor will know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Professor Medite explained the task, each team grouped together and began preparing to pick herbs.</p>

<p>Garnet Team 9. That was the name given to our team. The four members were me, the team leader, Lapis, Nero, and Frey.</p>

<p>It happened when we waited for our turn to depart at the edge of the beach and we were checking our baggage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a competition, Makia O&rsquo;Drielle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Team 1 led by Beatrice approached us and declared war on me.</p>

<p>And then she glanced over at Nero, who was right next to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to win over Mr. Nero, the head of our class. He didn&rsquo;t take up my offer to join my team at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he was irritated by the condescending way you invited him&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, while looking up at the gulls flying in the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what are we basing the competition on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that this off-campus field training&rsquo;s evaluation points will be announced in a ranking format. So, the one who earns the higher rating wins. I shall show you how much more superior my team is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm. Well, alright. I&rsquo;ll take you up on that competition. Because it&rsquo;s so troublesome, let&rsquo;s wager on something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put my hand over my mouth and made a proposition with a wicked grin on my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-what do you want to wager on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, yes. If I win, you must treat me to a lemon pie from the dining hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...That&rsquo;s all you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An entire pie! Don&rsquo;t look down on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rivals of Team 1 looked at each other and tilted their heads, as though they didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;V-very well. Then, if I win...please give Mr. Nero to my team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero shook his head with a very displeased look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do that, then you&rsquo;ll have an extra person on your team, and we&rsquo;ll be lacking one person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;When that time comes, I&rsquo;ll give you one person from my team. Like my butler, Nicholas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my lady says so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furthermore, Nicholas Harbury, Beatrice&rsquo;s butler, seemed to be okay with it. His amiable smile didn&rsquo;t even crumble a single bit. They seemed to have a trusting relationship in a certain sense, but that made me even more irritated.</p>

<p>And for a moment...Thor came into my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;ll be time for us to depart soon. Well then, good luck to all of you in Team 9.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we could accept the condition regarding Nero, Team 1 set off to gather herbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, I was wagered against my will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, isn&rsquo;t it alright? I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll pamper you more on that team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not alright. I hate those kinds of people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Ooh, you&rsquo;re being unusually assertive, silent boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey teased Nero. I quieted the two of them down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to worry. Simply put, we just need to win. Nero, if you don&rsquo;t get serious too, you&rsquo;ll be turned into Beatrice&rsquo;s servant. You understand that, don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yeah. I&rsquo;ll take it on seriously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ooh, the always listless-looking Nero was being filled with a quiet motivation.</p>

<p>This was worth accepting the competition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frey, Lapis. We&rsquo;ll also work hard to protect Nero. And get that lemon pie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Makia. We can&rsquo;t lose,&rdquo; Lapis said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...What you want most is the lemon pie anyways,&rdquo; Frey said.</p>

<p>Right when I raised the morale of my team members, Team 9 was called, and we hurried towards the departure spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone brought their boxed lunch? If anything happens, break the magic signal light. Now, take care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t my first mission, but it was my first off-campus field training. After being sent off by the overprotective Professor Medite, we finally set foot on the Medicinal Herb Garden Island.</p>

<p>It was an island that maintained its natural form while also having an artificially arranged neatness.</p>

<p>Walking paths stretched out here and there, and there were of course lemon trees everywhere. Since we came all this way, I picked several lemons and put them away in my favorite basket. It was just like a picnic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re picking ponsidas? That&rsquo;s a pretty easy task~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey yawned carefreely, but I didn&rsquo;t think it was such a soft task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so simple? We aren&rsquo;t just picking herbs, we also have to submit the &lsquo;Pon eye drops.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Pon eye drops isn&rsquo;t that hard of a potion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the pitfall of this task. It's easy to find ponsidas growing in the wild, but there&rsquo;s surprisingly not a lot of high quality ones.And yet, the Pon eye drops is a potion where the quality of the herbs used to make it is strikingly obvious to see. There are about ten ranks depending on the quality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along the path as we walked, we found some ponsidas right away. All of the plants around here were nothing but low quality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think the thing that will decide the evaluation of this task is the &lsquo;quality&rsquo; of the Pon eye drops. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of collecting ponsidas, and it&rsquo;s not a problem of speed or amount.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero was quick to read and understand the intent of the task.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s unpleasant about Professor Medite was that he didn&rsquo;t state that intent and tried to get the students to take it in themselves. If you didn&rsquo;t think about it, it seemed like a very simple task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I remember correctly, ponsidas grow in places where humidity is high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly, Lapis. The first thing we need to do is to find a waterside...a river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, and then tapped on Frey&rsquo;s wide back to say, It&rsquo;s your turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want me to check from above?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Please go on ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After Frey gave a deliberate sigh, he stuffed his hands into his pockets like usual and briskly went up a cliff as though it was flat land.</p>

<p>He was blessed by&#12304;Earth&#12305;, so he could freely move on anything that was connected to the earth, whether it was a cliff or a tree trunk. It was more of a unique physical constitution than magic. However, I&rsquo;ve heard that those who were blessed by Earth were bad with flying or floating vehicles and magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a river five hundred meters from here. I see a waterfall too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A waterfall! Yes, let&rsquo;s go there. That&rsquo;s definitely the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis tilted her head and said, &ldquo;Is there something good about waterfalls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always damp near a waterfall because of the flying drops of water. That&rsquo;s the best environment for ponsidas to grow. It&rsquo;s not written in our textbooks, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey descended, and when we went forward with him leading the way, we came across a huge boulder in the middle of our way. The path was blocked because of it. There was a cliff on the right-hand side, and a river on the left, so there was no place to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no! We were so close to the best position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a natural boulder. It&rsquo;s been put here by human hands. There are traces of magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero quickly examined it with his magical contact lenses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An obstacle put here by the professors? Do we give up on this path and go back?&rdquo; Frey said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s better to go on ahead. The fact that there&rsquo;s an obstacle here means that there&rsquo;s a good chance that we got a hit ahead. But there&rsquo;s a strong defensive wall magic placed on it, so we can&rsquo;t destroy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t destroy it, then does that mean that we can only climb it? Not everyone can be like Frey. What should we do&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, let me take care of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unusually for her, Lapis stepped up to the front. And then, she put her palm on the boulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lapis twi twilight&mdash;&mdash;Transfer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After she chanted that incantation, the boulder suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Transference magic&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero and Frey were astonished by it, their mouths and eyes wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was incredible! Transference magic on this scale is very high level!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Usually, it was a magic that was learned in the third year after acquiring levitation magic. The larger the amount of substance, the more difficult it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My clan is in the business of &lsquo;spatial magic&rsquo; and &lsquo;alchemy.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure it must have been transferred to another part of the island by now. For instance...right in front of Beatrice Asta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unusually for Lapis, she let out a nasty chuckle. That was the expression of someone who held a long grudge ever since she was told &ldquo;foreign students are useless&rdquo; at the welcome party.</p>

<p>Right when I was thinking it would actually be funny if that large stone was transferred right before Beatrice&rsquo;s eyes and blocking their way&#8230;</p>

<p>From out of nowhere, we heard Beatrice&rsquo;s standard &ldquo;This cannot be!&rdquo; and burst out laughing without thinking.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4></p>

<p>As we walked upstream, we finally came across the waterfall we were looking for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look. The steep rock cliffs around the waterfall are covered with ponsidas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The place right where the water came down and there was a scattered mist of water droplets.</p>

<p>The verdant moss and other plants also stood out, but the ponsidas could be spotted here and there.</p>

<p>They were a vivid yellow-green color. The feathery leaves were jagged, and there were sacs of magical power clinging to their undersides. They were called the magical sori.*</p>

<p> (TN: Sori is the plural form of sorus, which is a spore-producing receptacle on the underside of a fern frond.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look. These magical sori on the underside of this leaf are big and sparkly, right? These are the characteristics of a high-quality ponsida. The sori make a &lsquo;pon&rsquo; sound when you pop them, so that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called ponsidas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With good timing, the magical sori of the ponsida growing above my head popped.</p>

<p>After the light &ldquo;pon&rdquo; sound, sparkly spores of magical power scattered, forming bands and drifting in the air.</p>

<p>To the side of the waterfall, fresh water and the magical power of the atmosphere accumulated, allowing for the growth of high-quality ponsidas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go find the most high quality ponsidas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We started searching for the most high quality ponsidas, using our surroundings as a base, at once.</p>

<p>Our rivals haven&rsquo;t found this place yet, and we took as much as we could before they did.</p>

<p>For our task, the &ldquo;Pon eye drops,&rdquo; we needed about ten ponsidas. I want to gather the most high quality ones&#8230;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, I found some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...They&rsquo;re more splendid than the ones I found. As expected of Nero...I&rsquo;m a bit frustrated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah, sorry, Lapis. Those are &lsquo;pensidas,&rsquo; they&rsquo;re fakes. They look exactly like ponsidas, but their leaf shapes are different when you look closely. Here, look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It then happened when I was working hard with my team members to collect ponsidas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, there&rsquo;s a bunch of them growing over here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next thing I knew, Frey was walking on the rock cliffs and peeking into the other side of the waterfall. Apparently there was a cavern on the other side.</p>

<p>Although, since we couldn&rsquo;t easily walk on rock cliffs like Frey, we stepped into the shallow water near the cliffs and advanced while following the cliff until the water went over our knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;L-Lapis, um, would your feet be alright if they get wet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s no issue. Are you alright, Makia? You&rsquo;re shivering furiously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes. I was, after all, blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;, and people with this constitution were extremely weak against water and completely hopeless at swimming. One time, Thor had to save me because I nearly drowned in the pond in front of our mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-b-be careful not to fall into the waterfall lake! Watch your step!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Makia, you&rsquo;re the one in most danger here&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While Nero, who was leading the way, quipped in a low voice, we managed to finally reach the other side of the waterfall. I sighed a deep breath of relief.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a large cavern, and there were good and sturdy footholds. And it was quite cool.</p>

<p>First, I used a hot wind magic, which I was good at, and dried my soaked teammates and I. Mm, we&rsquo;re good as new.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place is amazing&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cavern was hidden by the waterfall curtain. The rock face was always wet, and even our hair and robes that were finally dried would become damp immediately if we stood close to the waterfall.</p>

<p>However, this certainly was a treasure trove of magical plants.</p>

<p>There were high quality plants and moss densely growing on the rock face.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Look at this! There are so many high quality ponsidas. And precious dew grass and firefly moss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While recalling the excitement of the times when I was collecting treasure in the Salt Forest, I started picking them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are ten ponsidas right here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. With this, we should be able to make the best Pon eye drops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem. I was the one who found this place, wasn&rsquo;t I? Feel free to fall in love with me. Oh, but I&rsquo;m not interested in younger women, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Lapis and I beheld Frey with expressionless gazes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. We collected the ingredients, and now let&rsquo;s make the &lsquo;Pon eye drops&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good with that, but I&rsquo;m starving, Leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While we boil the ingredients, let&rsquo;s have lunch. We&rsquo;ll be able to make good use of our time that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We settled down in a dry part of the cavern.</p>

<p>I took out a large picnic blanket from my basket and spread it out.</p>

<p>Then, I took out a pot I have been using for a long time, a base for lighting the pot, and a ladle, and then I drew water from the river there and immediately started boiling the ponsidas. We had to thoroughly boil them for an hour. During that time, we would be having lunch.</p>

<p>For lunch, we were told to eat canned food, crackers, and cheese prepared by the school.</p>

<p>The canned food was clam chowder, but&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you all like to make this clam chowder taste better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came all this way, so let&rsquo;s boil some pasta. Pasta in a pot outdoors is the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then I slowly pulled out a pack of dried noodles from my basket&#8230;</p>

<p>Pasta was the soul food of Ruschians. No one who disliked it, and everyone approved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you plan on cooking with canned clam chowder?&rdquo; Nero asked.</p>

<p>&rdquo;We have the lemons I picked earlier and the cheese they gave us, don&rsquo;t we? Once the pasta is completely boiled, we can mix it with clam chowder and cheese in the pot. And lastly, we&rsquo;ll squeeze the lemons. White sauce and lemon is the best combination, so it will definitely be delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My teammates gulped down their saliva. Even I was getting more and more hungry as I explained.</p>

<p>Originally, Miladriede had a dish called lemon pasta, which is pasta with cheese as well as lemon juice squeezed over it. This was an application of that.</p>

<p>I intentionally didn&rsquo;t use magic and drew clean water from the waterfall and boiled the noodles.</p>

<p>Then, I heated up the canned clam chowder and cheese in the pot, added the al dente noodles to it, and dressed it. When the cheese melted and the clam chowder was well mixed, I divided it among individual plates&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, it&rsquo;s full of clams. It looks delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miladriede was a seaside capital. Although it was canned, the clam chowder was high quality, and just mixing it with the pasta like this was a feast.</p>

<p>Finally, I grinded some pepper and lavishly squeezed one half of a fresh lemon over them...let&rsquo;s eat!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah...pasta is just right after a good workout. It&rsquo;s revitalizing on top of being delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it comes to Miladriedeans, it&rsquo;s lemons for sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miladriedeans&#8230;? But you&rsquo;re right, this is refreshing and delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We moved around a lot, but everyone was digging in heartily.</p>

<p>I was the same. The creamy soup, soaked with a seafood flavor, had a rich and deep taste. The lemon juice was lavishly poured onto it. The sourness complemented the mildness of the clam chowder and cheese, creating a pasta that was sour but easy to eat and very early summer-like.</p>

<p>Lemons were also good for recovering from exhaustion. It was a yellow, tasty, and all around useful fruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me! I brought the elderflower cordials with me. If we dilute it with cold carbonated water, it&rsquo;ll definitely taste good. I think it&rsquo;ll go well with the pasta too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that thing from before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frey, I believe I asked you to give them to Big Sis Nagi, but did you give them to her without any incident?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I asked her out on a date.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey said proudly. I hope that date goes well&#8230;</p>

<p>I rummaged through my basket, took out the herb cordials that were in small vials as well as the cold carbonated water, and prepared four glasses. This basket had everything.</p>

<p>But I was startled. I never expected two hamsters to jump out the basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Popotarou, Donsuke!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The yellow and white dwarf hamster spirits. When the two spotted half-eaten crackers, they jumped at them and munched on them single-mindedly, stuffing their cheeks pouches with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-w-w-what should I do&#8230;? We were told to leave our spirits behind and come here, but they slipped into my basket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if you don&rsquo;t use them. There were students bringing their spirits with them in the other teams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, you&rsquo;re right, Nero. ...Hey, don&rsquo;t go looking for crackers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to scold them, but they looked like they were laughing at me&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-well, it&rsquo;s fine. Let&rsquo;s pull ourselves together and have a toast with the herb cordials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I poured the elderflower herb cordials into the glasses and diluted them with the cold carbonated water. It was a pretty light yellow drink. I passed them out to my team members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s celebrate the debut outing of Garnet Team 9&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We raised our glasses, clinked them together, and gulped the contents down.</p>

<p>The feeling of the cold carbonated water bouncing down my throat felt so pleasant&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haa...I&rsquo;m revived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooh, this is pretty good! I thought it smelled like medicine, but it&rsquo;s easy to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys seemed pleased as well. Lapis and I sideyed each other and giggled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elderflowers are an all-purpose herb. They can help prevent colds and remove toxins from the body. And it has a skin whitening effect. But it has a rich muscat-like aroma, and it&rsquo;s easy to drink with its acidity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, its efficacy was incredible, but it was generally chilled and delicious, so we drank it down in large gulps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any case, Makia. That basket isn&rsquo;t something that is sold on the market, isn&rsquo;t it. It has an extraordinarily advanced spatial magic applied to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this? It belonged to my ancestor, the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s old but sturdy, light and convenient. I use it a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I put my basket before me, Lapis put a finger to her chin and thought about it for a moment.</p>

<p> &ldquo;If that is the case, then it&rsquo;s from five hundred years ago&#8230; That was a time when spatial magic hadn&rsquo;t yet been established. And yet, such an advanced piece of spatial magic&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that she said it, it was true. In addition, if the Scarlet Witch was using spatial magic, that anecdote and magic would have been passed down in our family, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is only one magician who could use spatial magic at will in that era. It&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Black Demon King&rsquo;, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The perceptive Nero said. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Lapis nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait a minute. Are you saying that this basket was the Black Demon King&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was the common name for one of the three great magicians from five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Nero glanced at Lapis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while. Twilight is...probably the name of the clan that is descended from the &lsquo;Black Demon King.&rsquo; Lapis, are you the descendant of that &lsquo;Black Demon King&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey and I exclaimed in shock without waiting for Lapis&rsquo;s answer. I wasn&rsquo;t happy about having the same reaction as that man, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very knowledgeable, Mr. Nero. It is a clan that is thought to have died out already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis said, while gazing at the glass in her hand somewhat somberly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the reason why I know that this basket was made by the Black Demon King. In the past, the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch&rsquo; and &lsquo;Black Demon King&rsquo; were bitter enemies. However, perhaps the Black Demon King had the opportunity to make and present this basket to the Scarlet Witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. She might have swiped it from somewhere...Or she might have stolen it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I worshipped the Scarlet Witch, but she was infamous for being an evil witch.</p>

<p>She might have thought that this basket was convenient and wanted it.</p>

<p>You always get what you want, just like the way of the Scarlet Witch. It was because that was passed down through the O&rsquo;Drielle family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, this is surely a gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis said while checking the clasp of the basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Black Demon King always engraved his token on his gifts. Here is the...black dragon&rsquo;s claw emblem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh...it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There certainly was a mark that looked like a dragon&rsquo;s claw there. So this meant that it was a demon who served the Black Demon King?</p>

<p>It was a little surprising to think that the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black Demon King&rdquo; from five hundred years ago, who were thought to be quarrelling, had an exchange of giving and receiving gifts&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, the Pon eye drops!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We must not forget about the potion from our important task.</p>

<p>When the ponsidas were properly boiled down to a broth for one hour, we used the natural sea salt the school provided for us. The eye drops were mainly water, so all we had to do was dissolve a few drops of this ponsida broth and a little bit of salt into a bottle of water, and then mix. Professor Medite&rsquo;s recommended incantation was this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fre i noa&mdash;&mdash;settle the eye drops with a pon! ...What&rsquo;s with this lameass incantation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey, who lost the rock-paper-scissors game, cast the final spell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a shame that after all that hard work gathering the ponsidas, all we needed was a few drops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, Lapis. We only need a few drops, but the content of those drops is important. Simmering multiple ponsidas doubles the effect. That&rsquo;s what potions are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, since it would be a waste, I decided to pour the leftover broth into a preservation bottle I had in my basket and take it back. Ah, thank you, magic basket!</p>

<p>Nero cast a final cooling spell on the eye drops bottle as he shook it. And then,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mind if I test the results of this on myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Quiet Kid&rsquo;s pretty fired up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...No. Well, you&rsquo;re not wrong. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ll probably be the one most likely to feel the effects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Nero brushed Frey&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder away like it was trash, he dropped the freshly made Pon eye drops into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mm. ...It&rsquo;s pretty good. It refreshes the back of my eyes and washes away the magical dust and lens fatigue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero said as he blinked repeatedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t the only effects of Pon eye drops. They say that the more high quality it is, the more your vision improves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vision&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rest of us ended up dropping the Pon eye drops into our eyes as well.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, Nero suddenly stood up and walked around the cave, and then started rubbing a part of the rock wall with his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Nero?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a strange magical power...flowing from here. It&rsquo;s very rare, like silver stardust&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was hidden by thick vegetation, but there was a kind of narrow secret path through which a single person could pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you saying there&rsquo;s something on the other side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I can see more clearly thanks to the eye drops. It definitely seems to be coming from over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s the professors&rsquo; trap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero and I were a bit wary, but,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then that just means there&rsquo;s something great at the back. Let&rsquo;s go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, Frey had a point. There might be something on the other side.</p>

<p>We hurriedly put away the tools. The two ham-chans had eaten too many crackers and fallen asleep, so I put them in my robe&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

<p>And so we proceeded through the cave, following our curiosity.</p>

<p>Thanks to the mint-colored light of the firefly moss, we could see deeper into the cave even though it was narrow.</p>

<p>I was fantasizing about how there might be herbs never seen before, or materials that could be used for magic, or unknown creatures, but on the other hand, I was calmly thinking that it would be impossible for those things to be on a medicinal herb garden island managed by the school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dead end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a circle-shaped space at the end of the narrow path. This was probably the end of the cave.</p>

<p>As expected, there were no unknown plants or animals, but there seemed to be something protruding from the ground, and we peered into it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what this is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a metal pillar with a small lacrima magic crystal fitted into the center.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be an ancient relic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, this is still new. I wonder what it&rsquo;s used for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of everything, we were still magicians in training. Everyone was immensely curious, but we didn&rsquo;t carelessly touch it.</p>

<p>Yes, even though we didn&rsquo;t touch it, the lacrima suddenly flashed, as though it had detected something, and the pillar itself began to operate like it was some sort of device.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone, please move back! This is&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis instantly shouted. However in the middle of her sentence, a magical formula emerged on the surface of the stone, and there was a brilliant light.</p>

<p>I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to resist the magic that enveloped my body, but I still didn&rsquo;t have that kind of strength yet.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4></p>

<p>&ldquo;...Nnn&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes, I was in an unfamiliar forest.</p>

<p>Nero and Frey were lying right next to me, and I shook the two of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey, get up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two quickly regained consciousness and slowly got up. They didn&rsquo;t seem to be hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Lapis isn&rsquo;t here. What should we do&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm down, Makia. We probably got caught up in a transference magic spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Transference magic? Does that mean we were transported to another place like how Lapis moved that rock somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Lapis knows transference magic, which is probably why she was able to repel the transference magic that the device triggered. But we got caught up in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel like crap. ...Where are we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey looked sick from the effects of the transference magic. Since he was blessed by&#12304;Earth&#12305;, he was weak against this kind of travel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that this isn&rsquo;t even the herb garden island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Nero looked around, he put his hand to his eyes and checked the magical power in our surroundings.</p>

<p>His contact lenses seemed to still have the information about the magical power that resided on the herb garden island where we had just been, and it didn&rsquo;t seem to match up with this place.</p>

<p>The same metal pillar that had been in the cave earlier was at the base of a stump next to us. This was probably what linked that cave with this place.</p>

<p>However, it didn&rsquo;t start up no matter how much we touched or hit it. It activated so easily earlier though.</p>

<p>But we must not panic. I broke the glass ball of the &ldquo;magic signal light&rdquo; the school had given us for just such occasions. The light shot out from it and flew towards Lune Ruschia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judging from the direction the light flew, Lune Ruschia must be north. In that case, we&rsquo;re probably on an island that&rsquo;s even further from Miladriede. But with this, sooner or later, the teachers from the school will be looking for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how soon will the teachers be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well...I guess it&rsquo;ll depend on the distance. What if it&rsquo;s tomorrow&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero was in low spirits.</p>

<p>It was no wonder. If we couldn't get back in time, then we would have failed to complete the task.</p>

<p>There might be help on the way, but at the very least, we lost the competition against Beatrice. After all that effort to make those high quality Pon eye drops&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, there&rsquo;s a hut over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey spotted a hut a little further down the road.</p>

<p>We hurried to the front of the hut. It was quiet and there was no sign of anyone, but we knocked on the door anyway. If there was anyone there, we might be able to find out where we were&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one has come out. I wonder if it&rsquo;s a vacant house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No...there&rsquo;s someone inside. Someone with a great amount of magic. It&rsquo;s the same magic that was flowing in the cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero narrowed his eyes as though he was staring fixedly at the other side of the door.</p>

<p>His contact lenses could visually capture the flow of magical power, so he seemed to have detected the presence of human magic in this house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The door&rsquo;s locked. It&rsquo;s got a crazy strong lock spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a lock spell, then let me do it. I&rsquo;m much better at that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero crouched down and covered the keyhole with his hand.</p>

<p>All he did was close his eyes once and quickly open them, and the lock clicked open.</p>

<p>Without a ring or wand, and no incantation. He read the mechanism of the magic being used with the lenses affixed to his eyes, and removed it like he was untangling a tangled ball of yarn. And, he was very quick.</p>

<p>What was amazing about it was the fact that he was so quiet that it didn&rsquo;t look like he did anything amazing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re suddenly getting pretty motivated, aren&rsquo;t ya, Quiet Kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t make it back at this rate, I&rsquo;ll have to join Team 1.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t want that, I see&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While feeling grateful for Nero&rsquo;s quiet desperation, I pushed the unlocked door open and said &ldquo;Excuse us&#8230;&rdquo;, and then went inside. It was trespassing, but I hoped we would be forgiven as this was an emergency situation. Our backs were somewhat cautiously bent, so that we could escape when necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nero, where is the person with that magical power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...That room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero pointed to a room at the end of the hallway.</p>

<p>After taking a deep breath, I opened the door.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&#8230;? You aren&rsquo;t the bad people who kidnapped me.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>To our surprise, there was a girl tied up in ropes.</p>

<p>With the light streaming in from the window behind her, she wore an air of mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...What&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at the girl, and my eyes slowly widened.</p>

<p>Or rather, I doubted my eyes. That very, very nostalgic blazer uniform&#8230;</p>

<p>Large, brownish-black eyes with a soft impression. On her chestnut-colored short bob, there was a light blue flower hairpin. It was a different color from the one I used to wear often in my previous life.</p>

<p>She was tied up in ropes, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to be in pain, and she was sitting in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell is this? There&rsquo;s a girl tied up with ropes...is it that kind of play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid. That lock magic was the real thing. She&rsquo;s being imprisoned here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was obviously joking! But running into a kidnapping right after we got transported here, I got a bad feeling about all this. Oi, Leader, why are you keeping quiet...Leader?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero and Frey raised their eyebrows and looked curiously at each other because I, who was always nagging, was silent the whole time, and probably staring hard at the game with my mouth half-open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, where did you guys come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s light question was answered by Frey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Luna Ruschia students. And you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from the royal palace. I was feeling suffocated, so I slipped out of the palace and went for a walk on the streets of Miladriede, when I was suddenly kidnapped by villains in black masks. But it can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;m...the &lsquo;protagonist&rsquo; after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then with an &ldquo;Ah&rdquo;, as though she just remembered, she gave her name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Airi. I came from another world. Earth&rsquo;s Japan, it&rsquo;s called, but...I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl giggled, but...I knew it. I knew what kind of place Earth&rsquo;s Japan was.</p>

<p>And I knew this girl and her real name very well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka Airi.</p>

<p>My friend from my past life, and the girl who came to like the same person I did.</p>

<p></p>
