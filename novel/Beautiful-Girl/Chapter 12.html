<p><h2>Chapter 12: Unfolding Destiny </h2></p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4></p>

<p>Once upon a time.</p>

<p> In the &ldquo;Salt Forest&rdquo; of a southern country, a witch was born.</p>

<p>She was a beautiful girl with rose-colored hair and sea blue eyes, and she possessed immense magical power.</p>

<p>Rumors of her spread throughout the country, and people frequently came to rely on her power.</p>

<p>The witch listened to the people&rsquo;s requests, sometimes bringing rain to the fields, sometimes curing diseases, sometimes granting names of fate, sometimes driving enemy soldiers away with rains of fire&#8230;</p>

<p>However, too much power can give people fear.</p>

<p>The witch thought she helped a lot of people, but she was soon persecuted by the people and even ordered to be executed by the king, so she had no choice but to flee deep into the forest.</p>

<p>Thus the witch, now alone, continued to live while cursing the people.</p>

<p>She had spent some time holed up deep in the words, but one day, she heard rumors from migratory birds and mice that there was a male magician who possessed great power similar to herself.</p>

<p>The witch took an interest in that magician, so she baked her prized apple cake with salt apples, mounted her flying broom, and went to meet him.</p>

<p>If he was an equally strong magician, he might accept her&#8230;</p>

<p>The witch wanted friends.</p>

<p>It was lonely being by herself.</p>

<p>She had a faint hope that there was even just one person, somewhere in this world, who would live with her.</p>

<p>Now, the one she met in the northern country was a black-haired demon king.</p>

<p>The demon king, with his army of demons and beasts that people feared, had created a country in the snowy mountains where no one could enter, using a special spatial magic.</p>

<p>Then, when the demon king saw the witch who had come to meet him, he said this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate witches. You must be a crafty, wicked woman who has come to steal my country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, he thought that the apple cake brought by the witch was poisoned, so he threw the basket into the bottom of a valley.</p>

<p>The witch was greatly shocked, and she cried alone as she descended the mountain.</p>

<p>She was by nature prone to tears, a weakling, and had a glass heart. Her tears were so hot that they melted the snow of the snowy mountain, but she didn&rsquo;t care and continued to cry as she went down the mountain.</p>

<p>And so, she made up her mind.</p>

<p>Just being a witch made her hated. Therefore, she would become the wicked witch that everyone misunderstood her to be.</p>

<p>Because if that really was true, and not a misunderstanding, then maybe she would be a little less sad.</p>

<p>After that, the witch did go there many times to play, under the pretense of coming to steal the demon king&rsquo;s country.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t lose, don&rsquo;t be shocked, don&rsquo;t get bored.</p>

<p>Rampage, rampage, sometimes setting up tea time to chat, and then rampaging again&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the big quarrel between the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Black Demon King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12295;</p>

<p>I woke up with a start.</p>

<p>I felt like I had been dreaming, but I could barely remember it.</p>

<p>The only thing I felt was a strange sensation, like I was winding red thread by hand and bringing it close to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh...that&rsquo;s right, at the ball, I...&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the spur of the moment, I chanted the incantation hidden in that recipe book and used a strange magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s up, dechi...it&rsquo;s alright now, dechi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, po...Milady&rsquo;s fever is going down, poyo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huh. ...My two ham-chans were talking next to me.</p>

<p>I got up slowly, and the white Popotarou slipped off my forehead.</p>

<p>It seemed that Popotarou, who was a&#12304;Water&#12305;attribute spirit, was lying on my forehead and admirably acting as a wet towel.</p>

<p>Also, there were a lot of wildflowers and clovers laid near my pillow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you two do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two ham-chans looked up at me with pure eyes. &ldquo;Dechi.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poyo.&rdquo; They said and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can talk, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Popotaro and Donchuke talked from the start, Milady would have fainted from the shock, poyo. Popotaro and Donchuke were the Lady Scarlet Witch&rsquo;s spirits, after all, poyo. Good at being attentive, poyo. Talented, po~.&rdquo; Crinkle crinkle.</p>

<p>The white and fluffy Popotarou said as he groomed himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Donchuke sensed something very bad from that old man, so Donchuke started a mission to follow him, dechi. Sorry for disappearing without permission, dechi. Donchuke is giving Milady a four-leaf clover as an apology, dechi.&rdquo; Lick lick.</p>

<p>The smaller and yellow Donsuke said while licking his teeny little hands.</p>

<p>...Hamster dialect?</p>

<p>They had very cute and relaxing voices, but they both spoke in different and distinctive ways. However, it was just that their mouths didn&rsquo;t move, and it was creepy how I couldn&rsquo;t tell where their voices were coming from, but cute things were cute.</p>

<p>I got up and scooped the two dwarf hamsters into my palm.</p>

<p>Now I knew.</p>

<p>The owner of the diary hidden in that recipe book was my great ancestor, the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And these two were, without a doubt, the excellent spirits who served that witch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Because of you two, we were able to punish the villains. Thank you, Donsuke, for your hard work. Thank you for coming back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that, the two looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Popotaro and Donchuke are the ones who should be thanking Milady, poyo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady summoned Donsuke and Popotaro to her side, dechi&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For some reason, tears welled up in their eyes, and they both ended up crying profusely.</p>

<p>I wondered why they were crying. I didn&rsquo;t know why, but they were so lovable that I started crying too. I stroked the two as much as I could. And patted them. They were springy and rubbed up against me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Popotaro and Donchuke worked hard for the sake of Milady, poyo~&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, dechi! By the way, Donchuke found things like these in the enemy camp, dechi.&rdquo; Slap, slap.</p>

<p>The yellow Donsuke clapped his cheek pouches with his tiny hand and spat out something.</p>

<p>It was a round silver button...what was this thing?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia&#8230;, you&rsquo;re awake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment, Lapis entered the bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I perhaps get into quite a lot of trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might have been because you used such large-scale magic, but you had been suffering from a high fever for some time afterwards. It has been three days since the ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three days!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ever since I was born in Maydare, I have never experienced getting nightmares with a high fever. I was blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;, so my body temperature was always high, and that was normal for me.</p>

<p>I wonder if it was because of the magic I used at the ball&#8230;</p>

<p>The secret technique of the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch&rdquo; hidden in the recipe for salt apple juice.</p>

<p>If that recipe book was a diary that hid the Scarlet Witch&rsquo;s secret arts, then I need to try the other recipes to check the secret arts&#8230;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, it&rsquo;s better for you to eat something. Also, you&rsquo;ve been told to go see Professor Ulysses once you are feeling better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Ulysses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The matter of you at the ball was left entirely in the hands of Professor Ulysses, who is a Lune Ruschia Magic School teacher. It seems that the professor, who is also a prince, defended you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>By &ldquo;defended,&rdquo; did that mean I was being treated as a problem by the palace?</p>

<p>It might be inevitable. I did use magic that no one else knew about.</p>

<p>Also, I wanted to know what happened with that affair afterwards.</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses might know something about the magic I used. He should have witnessed it there, after all.</p>

<p>I ate a bowl of barley gruel, took a shower and cleaned myself up, then went to go see Professor Ulysses.</p>

<p>The professor was looking out the large window in his atelier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello and welcome, Miss Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor always had a gentle and soft air around him, but today there was a tense atmosphere about him.</p>

<p>Today was cloudy. The wind was blowing a bit strongly. From this large window, I could see the students chattering and moving around the school grounds as usual.</p>

<p>At the professor&rsquo;s urging, we sat down on the sofas in the room and faced each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, I&rsquo;m sorry, sir. I caused you trouble the other day because of my willfulness. ...Is Thor alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked about Thor. I was more concerned about him than anything else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used healing magic on Mr. Thor, so his injuries healed quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness...Thank you, professor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the supervisor of the Savior and Guardians, and I am also their advising magician, so it is only natural that I would do so. Rather, Mr. Thor asked about your condition many times. Your foot injury healed quickly, but I had much trouble with your high fever, as neither healing magic nor potions would work on it, so...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be a reaction to the use of special magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor finished his sentence. I recalled the sight of the magic I used the other day once again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I heard that you defended me. So does that mean the palace considers me a danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said as I gripped my skirt above my knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true that the palace is being cautious. However...the only person who could have done something about the situation at that time was you, Miss Makia. The margrave had a foreign transference magic device implanted in his body. It is a small-sized, cutting edge object, something unable to be sensed by Ruschia&rsquo;s antiquated magic. The restraint magic that enclosed Mr. Thor and Airi is a magical technique developed in a foreign country and used for warfare, and it is difficult for modern Ruschian magic to respond to it immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses told me in a matter-of-fact but thorough manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the margrave intended, the Savior&rsquo;s life was in danger, but you used exceptional magic and defused the situation. ...Where did you learn that spell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a spell hidden in our family recipe book my grandmother gave me. It seems to be the diary of my ancestor, the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Scarlet Witch&rsquo;s...diary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color of Professor Ulysses&rsquo; eyes changed slightly, and he put his hand to his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason the palace is cautious is that the magic you wielded was reminiscent of the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo; There is no doubt that is because you are the descendant of that witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had no choice but to hang my head and listen to him. After all, the Scarlet Witch is a symbol of evil, nothing more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some who claim that the magic of the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch&rsquo; is harmful to the Savior. The reason is that five hundred years ago, that witch killed the Savior along with herself. ...However, Miss Makia, you used the supposedly lost &lsquo;Command Magic&rsquo; the other day, a magic that in some ways threatens even modern magic. You, who are able to use it, have the makings of an extraordinary magician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Command Magic&#8230;? An extraordinary magician&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked up suddenly. I couldn&rsquo;t understand it at all.</p>

<p>However, Professor Ulysses began to speak, looking off somewhere in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know about the &lsquo;Black Demon King,&rsquo; the &lsquo;White Sage,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch&rsquo; from five hundred years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those three great magicians are especially famous, and there are other extraordinary magicians who have left their mark on history. For example, three hundred years ago, there was the &lsquo;Wisteria Princess,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Archbishop of Holy Ash,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Blue Jester&rsquo;...the representatives of eight hundred years ago are the &lsquo;Yellow Dragon Commander&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Azure Consort&rsquo;...going back to a thousand years ago, there are the &lsquo;Gold King&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Silver King&rsquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew them all. Every single one of them were magicians of legend and anecdotes.</p>

<p>These magicians might seem like characters from an old fairy tale, but they certainly did exist in this world, and they had influenced history, for better or for worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People act as though only the &lsquo;Savior&rsquo; who appeared from another world is special, but the ones who influence Maydare are, first and foremost, magicians. The &lsquo;Savior&rsquo; merely bears the role of correcting the course of the magicians&rsquo; curiosity and judgment, which sometimes lead them in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was only listening, but&#8230;</p>

<p>What Professor Ulysses said just now seemed to be very important somehow.</p>

<p>The professor&rsquo;s light citrus yellow eyes were tinged with a calm and subdued magic. However, I felt like his words were filled with an indescribable passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Makia. You may become a great magician whose name will be engraved in history. It is probably best to use that magic rarely, but...when you feel that you truly need to, listen to your heart. If you indeed have the makings of a great magician, a switch will quietly turn on within you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A switch? Sir, did you also have that kind of experience?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I asked that, the professor&rsquo;s countenance changed all of a sudden, but he quickly kept his composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I suppose so. Yes, let us say that I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He chuckled and only left meaningful words.</p>

<p>A switch will turn on, he said. I had felt something like that at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything else you will like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, I&rsquo;ve been sleeping for a long time, and I don&rsquo;t know what happened after the ball. The enemy...Margrave Greigs, what exactly was his goal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The margrave had learned of the Savior&rsquo;s existence early on and has been secretly uniting those who claim to be against the Savior. But the true mastermind behind all of this seems to be someone else. That person contacted the margrave, inflamed their emotions, and tried to have the Savior killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do they disavow the Savior? Isn&rsquo;t the Savior the one who will guide the world to peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That...is because there is a considerable number of people who will be inconvenienced with the Savior&rsquo;s intrusion. Those who do not want her to stop the conflict ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered what kind of people they are.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Savior is summoned into this world to &lsquo;defeat&rsquo; something. That something will be determined when the Savior and Guardians go to the Holy Land and receive the prophecy from Vabel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Green Priestess&rsquo;, but if there is anyone who is already aware of what that will be, they may consider making the first move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first move...that reminds me, Dontanates had something like this in his cheek pouch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took the silver button Donsuke had spit out from my pocket and placed it in front of the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...This is&#8230;&rdquo; the professor took it in his hand and raised it up. &ldquo;This is a remarkable accomplishment, Miss Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The true form of our enemy may be revealed very soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor hurriedly stood up, as though he had seen the button before. And then he looked down at me, who had no idea what was going on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think? Those two are excellent spirits, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, and smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>The professor had always known how excellent my little spirits were.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4></p>

<p>The next day, after discussing with Professor Medite about how to supplement the lessons I missed while I was asleep, I headed for the usual glass bottle atelier. Nero and Frey were there, each doing their own thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Makia&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can walk around now, Leader?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero was, as ever, making something, and Frey was lying on the windowsill, idling around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you two were here, so I came. I&rsquo;m really sorry for all the trouble I caused you guys. I baked some salt apple caramel muffins to thank you, or rather, I had to bake them for a reason, so I brought the ones left over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we in charge of the leftovers or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t say that, Frey. It&rsquo;s a special magical recipe that helps to regulate the disorder of magical power. You should be grateful for them as a magician.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as prideful as ever, Leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Frey said that, he came over to get the muffins. I also passed one to Nero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Did you get your hair trimmed, Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero looked at me and narrowed his eyes as he took the muffin.</p>

<p>Indeed, my hair was much shorter than before. It used to be to my waist, but now it was just past my shoulders. Personally, I thought it was cute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big Sis Nagi trimmed it for me last night. I cut it off roughly at the ball, so it was pretty messy and unfinished. But it&rsquo;ll grow out quickly. My hair has always grew well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Senior Nagie...huh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey fell into melancholy at the window with a faraway look in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my, Frey. Didn&rsquo;t you say you asked her out on a date? You&rsquo;re an experienced veteran, but you&rsquo;re having a hard time with Big Sis Nagi?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah. After the ball, everyone in school found out that I was a prince. After that, the minute Senior Nagie saw me, she said, &lsquo;A prince is too much for me...&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah...my condolences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true that Big Sis Nagi would find a man in the position of prince as troublesome.</p>

<p>At any rate, this glass-bottle atelier had become a meeting place for the members of Team 9 before we knew it. We were willfully boiling water and making herb tea, as well as persisting in having tea time with the salt apple caramel muffins I bought.</p>

<p>These muffins were a classic treat my mother often made. The dough was moist, and the saltiness of the salt apples and the sweetness of the caramel mixed well together. How should I put it, the sour-sweet salty caramel flavor that was produced was quite addictive.</p>

<p>By the way, there was a diary entry hidden in this recipe as well. But there was no hidden spell.</p>

<p>I would have to try the other recipes again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, when exactly did you learn to use magic like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if on cue, Nero asked about that aforementioned magic. As I peeled off the muffin&rsquo;s paper cup, I said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you curious about it as the head of the class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew only the incantation from the beginning. I recalled it at that moment and thought I should use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I continued truthfully, &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those were my true, honest impressions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a shame that the palace didn&rsquo;t give you any reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fact, it was because you were able to use magic that they were able to arrest the margrave who was behind the attack, right? I just think that the palace should cough it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you, the fifth prince, make some kind of suggestion about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey waved his hand in front of his face at Nero&rsquo;s nonchalant jab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nope nope. I don&rsquo;t have that kind of authority. I really am just a pointless fifth prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, we ate the salt apple caramel muffins. We just devoured them, without saying whether they tasted particularly good or bad. As I ate, I asked them about their future plans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, what are you guys doing for summer vacation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m...going back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero said with his tendency to look away somewhere. When I asked him where his home was, he replied matter-of-factly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret.&rdquo; He was a secretive boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about you, Frey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of stuff going on, and they told me to go back home. I&rsquo;ll be at the palace for a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm. Lapis says she&rsquo;s going back to Frezier for summer vacation. She went to buy a ship ticket earlier. I&rsquo;ll have to book a train ticket too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to Deliafield?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Nero. But I have to take supplementary classes for the first three days of summer vacation, so it&rsquo;ll be after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The long summer vacation was about to begin. I have been able to meet my dependable team members, and I think that the first half of my freshman year has been quite good.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Several days later. My team members had gone back home and although I was lonely, at the glass-bottle atelier, I took in the drying net I had put outside during the day.</p>

<p>The drying net was dotted with round, red, and wrinkled things.</p>

<p>I was in the middle of making apricot umeboshi. I had just finished drying them in the sun.</p>

<p>Though it wasn&rsquo;t exactly Japanese umeboshi, I disinfected apricots with alcohol, pickled them in salt and lemon juice, added red shiso, and shook the accumulated plum vinegar. It all took about a month.</p>

<p>Although high school students in my previous life didn&rsquo;t know how to pickle umeboshi properly, I have pickled and dried various things as a magician in this world, so I relied on those skills and the memories of the taste from my previous life to try making umeboshi. I started to dry them in the sun a few days ago and finished today. I put them back in the plum vinegar again, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist and decided to taste one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The red shiso gives it a nice color...It really does look exactly like umeboshi, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to eat it. My mouth and eyes immediately narrowed. Mmm, it was so sour!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, it&rsquo;s more umeboshi than I thought. It does have a fruity apricot flavor, though. ...I wonder if I should use a bit more salt. But it&rsquo;s my first time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I was alone, I talked to myself a lot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, now let&rsquo;s cook some rice! Umeboshi needs rice. The cafeteria is closed, so it&rsquo;ll be umeboshi rice balls tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt sad that I couldn&rsquo;t share this excitement with anyone, but I was going to try cooking the rice I bought from the market in town in an earthenware pot in the atelier.</p>

<p>First, I washed the rice, steeped it in water and put it aside for a little bit, then drained the water with a sieve and moved it to the pot.</p>

<p>After smoothing out the rice in the pot,</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amount of water should be enough to cover the back of your hand with your palm on the surface of the rice...right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was where the rice cooking techniques I learned in outdoors school in my previous life came in handy.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s light the fire.</p>

<p>I have been waiting a long time for the day when I could eat rice and the umeboshi would be ready.</p>

<p>If it tastes good, I would bring these umeboshi as a present for Mother and Father.</p>

<p>I wanted to eat them with rice, so I&rsquo;ll have to go into town tomorrow to buy more&#8230;</p>

<p>With all that, the rice has finished cooking.</p>

<p>The rice was a bit longer and narrower than the kind in Japan, but when I broke it up with a wooden spatula and ate it, I felt that it tasted the same as the rice I knew. It was a little hard, maybe it needed more water, maybe it was the type of rice, but rice was rice.</p>

<p>I immediately made some umeboshi rice balls.</p>

<p>I broke the fruit into pieces, removed the seeds, mixed them with the plum vinegar to make a soft semi-paste, then wrapped them in rice and added a little salt.</p>

<p>It would have been nice to have some seaweed, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any, so I left it as it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haaaaa&#8230; The umeboshi rice balls I&rsquo;ve always yearned for are complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mere white triangular lump sparkled like treasure.</p>

<p>Now...let&rsquo;s try it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when I opened my mouth wide, I heard a strange noise above me, as though to interrupt my taste testing.</p>

<p>I wondered if someone came into the atelier, so I walked upstairs from the basement kitchen, looked outside, and was...at a loss for words. There was a black monster through the glass walls.</p>

<p>Giant wings. It was a &mdash;&mdash;dragon!?</p>

<p>&ldquo;G-Gyaaaaaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but shout again, but upon closer look, I saw Thor straddling the dragon&rsquo;s back. He suddenly put out his head and mouthed, &ldquo;Can you come out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, I rushed out. The dragon landed on the open beach in front of me, and, as though he was used to it, Thor alighted next to it with a flutter of his cloak.</p>

<p>The black dragon and its gallant knight against the backdrop of the ocean at dusk was picturesque, but I ran up to them and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor!? What are you doing here on magic school premises! You&rsquo;re going to get caught as a suspicious person&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s fine. When that time comes, I&rsquo;ll tuck my tail between my legs and run away immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What was he saying with that crisp and cool face?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because if I don&rsquo;t do this, I won&rsquo;t be able to see you, milady, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right at that moment, the dragon flapped its wings and silently took off. Every time it flapped its wings, snow crystals fluttered down. It was cool and refreshing in the summertime twilight&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my spirit, the ice dragon Griminde. His attribute is&#12304;Ice&#12305;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, Thor, you summoned a dragon!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was shocked. A dragon spirit was worthy of the highest rank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As expected of you! He&rsquo;s so amazing, so cool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I praised his spirit, Thor looked a little pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you feeling all right now? I heard you had a high fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &quot;It's because I used a strange spell. I must have scared you.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, Thor stared at me for a moment. He gently reached out and touched the tips of my shortened hair, which was swaying in the sea breeze. His face twisted with some sort of regret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this? Fufu, this isn&rsquo;t so bad, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But milady, you&rsquo;ve always prized your long hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was for a time like this. If it&rsquo;s for protecting someone I cared about, then I&rsquo;m glad that I took good care of my hair. Besides, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to try cutting it off at least once. I&rsquo;ll take good care of it again and grow it out like before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I smiled a smile filled with determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Milady is milady. Anytime, anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor murmured, and then cleared his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady, would you like to go on a date with me tonight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Date?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady, it&rsquo;s your sixteenth birthday today, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I widened my eyes. That&rsquo;s right. I had completely forgotten about it myself.</p>

<p>Did Thor come all the way to this school in order to celebrate my birthday?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might be interested in flying on the back of a dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re giving me a ride!? Of course! I absolutely want to ride!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor looked like he was about to laugh again as I pitched my body overly forward and appealed to him.</p>

<p>Oh, but I just made umeboshi rice balls&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Can I bring my magic basket with me? Actually...I have something I want you to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that, but what do you want me to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umeboshi rice balls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; Thor tilted his head. I hurried back to the glass-bottle atelier, stuffed the rice balls I had made earlier into the magic basket, and then went back out to the beach with them.</p>

<p>On the beach, the ice dragon Griminde was already waiting for us with his body lowered. What a good boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor gently held me up and placed me on the dragon&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>He mounted the dragon behind me and held me in front of him, then grabbed the reins and ordered the dragon to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-wooooow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weak summer breeze and the cold wind created by the ice dragon blew against my face together.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes, the night view of Miladriede was so dazzling and beautiful that I cried out from excitement many times.</p>

<p>The pale brilliant lights of Miladriede Castle. The holy Diemo Cathedral with its ten statues placed up high.</p>

<p>The brick bridges illuminated by stained glass spell-light street lamps, and the sparkling canals.</p>

<p>In the distance, at the edge of the sea, I could see the faint orange afterglow&#8230;</p>

<p>We landed on that bench on the roof of Diemo Cathedral.</p>

<p>Magical fireworks were launched in the direction of the port, welcoming the arrival of summer and foreign cruise ships.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fireworks were very beautiful at the moment they bloomed, but when I followed the lights that fell as they disappeared with my eyes, I wondered what lay ahead of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady, didn&rsquo;t you say you wanted me to eat something? Please give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a composed look on his face, Thor plainly prompted me with his hand. What a glutton!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like you to beg so boldly on your former lady&rsquo;s birthday. But, you know, I think you&rsquo;re going to like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I brought out two rice balls wrapped in paper from my basket and gave one to Thor. Thor quickly peeled off the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this rice? We sometimes eat paella at the palace. Lady Airi likes rice dishes. Oh, um...do I just eat it like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, exactly. Just take a big bite out of it. There&rsquo;s something amazing inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something amazing&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor looked at the rice ball curiously and observed it from various angles, but since there was no information other than it was a white triangular lump, he straightforwardly took a bite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered if he was surprised by the sourness of the umeboshi.</p>

<p>I gulped as he looked startled, or rather, paled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, what is this intense sour taste...Milady, you really do hate me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was his reaction!? So Thor didn&rsquo;t remember the taste of umeboshi&#8230;</p>

<p>However, Thor faced the umeboshi rice ball once more, gulped, then took a few more bites and chewed.</p>

<p>Soon, he seemed to have gotten used to eating it, and his expression settled down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first bite was so sour that I was surprised, but after the second bite, for some reason, O felt very nostalgic. ...Why is that? I don&rsquo;t know...I&rsquo;ve never eaten this before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor closed his eyes.</p>

<p>Along with the umeboshi rice ball, he was chewing on the homesickness that had welled up from somewhere else. That was the expression on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you ate it somewhere, sometime before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, might be true. I don&rsquo;t know where or when that was. I think I liked eating this. Yes, it&rsquo;s delicious&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor gave a rare, honest smile. I was speechless at that expression on his face.</p>

<p>Aah, I knew it&#8230;</p>

<p>You were the boy I loved in my past life.</p>

<p>In those forgotten days, every morning, you eagerly stuffed your cheeks with umeboshi rice balls.</p>

<p>Thor probably had no memory of those times. However, it wasn&rsquo;t that there was no trace of them, and this moment when I felt that they overlapped was important to me.</p>

<p>Combined with the nostalgic taste of the umeboshi rice balls, it made me want to cry&#8230;</p>

<p>For a while, we quietly talked to each other about magic school and Thor&rsquo;s work at the palace.</p>

<p>As soon as Thor was taken to the royal palace, he joined the Order of the Royal Palace and was trained hard under Sir Lionel, the vice commander, to prepare for the appearance of the Savior. It seemed that he met Miss Airi last summer, and now he was searching for the final Guardian while protecting her by her side.</p>

<p>My two years weren&rsquo;t as turbulent as Thor&rsquo;s, but I told him how I had successfully enrolled into magic school, just as Thor wished on that night the stars fell, and how I had struggled to gather team members.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell him everything about the past two years, but I was so happy to have the time to talk with Thor. That was all I needed to be happy.</p>

<p>The fireworks were over, and the lights of the city began to go out one by one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor took out something from his breast pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is for you, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the earrings he gave me on my birthday two years ago.</p>

<p>And the ones I had returned to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave these to you exactly two years ago on this date. Please accept these again. ...If you truly don&rsquo;t want them, please throw them into the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...But, Thor-&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them back. There&rsquo;s no one else I want to give them to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I accepted the earrings without hesitation.</p>

<p>And then, I held them up to the night sky where there were not many stars visible.</p>

<p>Only these sparkled like a first magnitude star, and they were very beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I truly did miss them. It&rsquo;s like a part of my body is missing without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was how much I had clung to these earrings and worked hard for these two years.</p>

<p>I cupped them in my hands, placed them against my cheek, exhaled a long breath, and then attached them to my ears.</p>

<p>Just like I did every morning as soon as I woke up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy sixteenth birthday, Lady Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. ...For me, today, the day when I met you, is the luckiest day in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, we giggled at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aiming to become an honor student at magic school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An honor student, you say? That&rsquo;s a fitting title for Milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I get good grades and get a job at the palace, I might be able to take part in something to help support you and everyone else, you know? I want to use the resources of the Salt Forest to develop something useful. I want to help you, Thor, even if it&rsquo;s behind the scenes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor was silent for a bit, and then said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s...very Milady-like, and encouraging to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll do something useful. I&rsquo;ll make sure you stay safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know when his role would end. I didn&rsquo;t know if there was even an end to it.</p>

<p>I became a little frightened when I saw Thor risk his life to protect Miss Airi in that incident.</p>

<p>I was afraid that Thor was going to be in a lot of danger from now on. But&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first met you, I knew. I knew that you weren&rsquo;t a normal boy, but a magician who would play a very important role in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore, this was inevitable.</p>

<p>I was lonely when he left the O&rsquo;Drielle family, but I was sure that the slave boy I found would become an important existence to this world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady. It isn&rsquo;t just me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A magician who plays an important role in this world...Milady, you are surely one as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor declared with conviction in his words. He then turned to me again with a serious look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to you, Mialdy, who found me. And for giving me a name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember when you gave me this name? I hated saying my real name. To tell the truth, ever since I can remember, I&rsquo;ve never felt comfortable with my name. I even thought that it was my name that caused me misfortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a feeling I felt as well.</p>

<p>In my previous world, I had also always felt that my name didn&rsquo;t fit me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, when Milady gave me the name &lsquo;Thor,&rsquo; it felt like I have finally found what I have been looking for...Yes, I felt like I have been reborn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I slowly widened my eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to say it, but that is why today is my birthday as well. When you call me by this name...for some reason, I feel like crying uncontrollably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled desolately with a heartrending face&#8230;</p>

<p>Then, Thor flipped his cloak and knelt before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please wait a little longer, Milady. I will fulfill my duty soon and return to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor, you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So please don&rsquo;t throw me away. If I don&rsquo;t have any place to return to, I&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor was afraid of being discarded, wanted a family, and yearned to live in peace.</p>

<p>Even though he has been toyed with by fate many times due to his unparalleled power.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know he treasured the name I had given him in such a way.</p>

<p>So I embraced Thor, wrapping him in my arms. So that he didn&rsquo;t feel alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, Thor. I won&rsquo;t abandon you. I won&rsquo;t forget you. I won&rsquo;t forget you, probably never. No matter...how many times I&rsquo;m reborn again&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s ask it one more time.</p>

<p>What is the truth of this feeling rising up in me?</p>

<p>This was not a lingering attachment from my past life, not a foolish feeling that became a dragged-out misunderstanding, but my own feelings of &ldquo;love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love you so much that it would be strange if it were otherwise.</p>

<p>It was true that I fell in love with Thor as Makia, while also inheriting the feelings of my &ldquo;mind neighbor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was so happy, so moved with emotion, to be able to be sure of that...</p>

<p>Now is the time to tell him. The words I had been unable to say for so long.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I...love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p> How good it would have been if I had been able to tell him properly at that time.</p>

<p>At almost the same time, there was a loud boom of thunder. It seemed to have struck very close to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Huh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so sudden that I was speechless. Thunder rumbled, and then rain began to pour down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining. There are sometimes thunderstorms at night lately. Milady, are you alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s return immediately. I&rsquo;ll take you to the school dormitory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor wrapped me in his cloak, put me on Griminde, and quickly took me to the balcony of the girls&rsquo; dorm.</p>

<p>The words probably didn&rsquo;t reach Thor. It was too drab and tasteless to repeat what I had told him earlier on parting, and Thor seemed to be in a hurry&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, see you, Milady. Please give my regards to the master and mistress at Deliafield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes. And Thor, do your duty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While scowling at the stormy night sky, Thor straddled his dragon and left, looking a bit reluctant to go. He must have gone back to Miss Airi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I...failed to confess again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought absentmindedly as I watched the silhouette fade into the distance in the rain.</p>

<p>The timing of it was like it had intentionally interfered with my confession.</p>

<p>If, as Miss Airi said, this world was the world of some story&#8230;</p>

<p>Then an existence like me wasn&rsquo;t necessary in the &ldquo;story of the Savior.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know anything about what was going on in this world.</p>

<p>But, I had a feeling.</p>

<p>Thor would be going further and further away&#8230;</p>

<p>Even if the scenario of the story didn&rsquo;t connect Thor and me together as one in the future.</p>

<p>I have to become a splendid magician and protect it. The place of safety Thor could return to.</p>

<p>So, please, even if it was just once.</p>

<p>May I be able to convey my sure feelings in these words.</p>

<p></p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah, I got wet. I have to take a shower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was soaked all over due to the thunderstorm. I rushed to the shower room and took off my clothes.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to confess, but I was filled with excitement from seeing Thor and being able to talk to him for a long time.</p>

<p>He said he will return to me.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t tell you how happy that made me.</p>

<p>I thought of the pain that was even tightening my chest as a sign that I was in love with Thor.</p>

<p>Aah, look at my face in the mirror. I was grinning so widely&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, my grin froze in an instant.</p>

<p></p>

<p> In the mirror, appearing brightly on my chest, was the&mdash;&mdash;Crest of the Four Lights.</p>
