<p><h2>Chapter 9: Potions Class Field Training 2<h2>
  
  <h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4>
  
  <p>I was speechless for a while, my face frozen in shock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, is there...something wrong? You don&rsquo;t look so good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl calling herself Airi called out to me. With that, I could finally breathe.</p>

<p>Even though she was tied up, the soft look of concern for me in her eyes was exactly the same as it was back then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re feeling sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no, I&rsquo;m...fine&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero and Frey tilted their heads with strange looks at my meek face.</p>

<p>...I mean, what? What&rsquo;s going on?</p>

<p>This was my classmate from my previous life, Tanaka-san?</p>

<p>Tanaka-san...weren&rsquo;t we killed together on the roof that day&#8230;?</p>

<p>However, this didn&rsquo;t seem like a rebirth like me, but rather, the Tanaka-san of that time herself.</p>

<p>Also, she doesn&rsquo;t realize that I was her former friend, &ldquo;Oda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wonder if I should reveal my previous life and say something like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>No, even though I had my past life memories, I was already a completely different person. It would only add chaos to an already chaotic situation. I&rsquo;d better not do that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyways, if you&rsquo;re kidnapped, you might as well run now. I&rsquo;ll untie you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having said something respectable, Frey took out a dagger from his inside jacket pocket and tried to cut the ropes that bound Tanaka-san, but it seemed that they couldn&rsquo;t be cut easily because a strong binding magic was cast on it.</p>

<p>But Tanaka-san was as laid-back as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be reckless. It&rsquo;s okay. My &lsquo;knights&rsquo; will be here soon to save me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knights?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Officially, they&rsquo;re called &lsquo;Guardians&rsquo;, but...it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m the &lsquo;Savior&rsquo; who was summoned into this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat at those words. Did this girl just call herself the Savior?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You guys should be the ones to get out of here quickly. When the villains come back, the side characters are the first to get killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Villains&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Side characters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many who want to take advantage of the Savior&rsquo;s special powers, and many enemies who fear those special powers. Well, stories always come with villains, and the hero is expected to get kidnapped, so there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it. My first maid was also an assassin...it&rsquo;s a common development. It&rsquo;s important for a story to have ups and downs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were taken aback by Tanaka-san&rsquo;s words. We couldn&rsquo;t make heads or tails of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, get out of here. If you&rsquo;re with me, you guys will be the ones they come after. And don&rsquo;t worry, protagonists like me don&rsquo;t die to begin with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san smiled, urging only us to escape.</p>

<p>It had been bothering me quite a lot since a while ago, but she seemed to think of this world as if it was some kind of &ldquo;story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, she seemed to be convinced that she was the &ldquo;protagonist&rdquo; of this so-called story.</p>

<p>It was true that Tanaka-san had always had this sort of tendency to daydream.</p>

<p>She loved books and manga, and was even writing her own novel. It was a story about an ordinary Japanese girl who was summoned to another world, where she found her place and fulfilled her special role.</p>

<p>She wanted to be someone&rsquo;s special existence. The real world was boring.</p>

<p>As she told me that she wanted to go somewhere far away, to the world of stories&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s going to happen next. It&rsquo;s a traditional development for a story. When the protagonist is in trouble, the knight will definitely come running. I&rsquo;m waiting for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-hold on a second&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I panicked. It was a little scary that she was convinced that she was the protagonist of a story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Tana...Miss Airi! This world, Maydare, is not a world of &lsquo;stories.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as &lsquo;it will definitely turn out this way.&rsquo; Your Guardians might not be able to find you here. That&rsquo;s why you have to escape right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I implored her, but her expression immediately turned cold.</p>

<p>It was an expression I had never seen before on Tanaka-san&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I don&rsquo;t think a Side Character C would say something like that...Could you be&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. No way, was my true identity exposed?</p>

<p>Tanaka-san&rsquo;s eyes were searching me. I felt like there was a sharpness in them that was quite different from how they used to be.</p>

<p>It was at that moment.</p>

<p>The door opened violently, and with the thumping of footsteps, men in black masks covering their eyes rushed in.</p>

<p>And then, the three of us were seized and pinned down to the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you brats! Did you break the lock spell and come in here!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, they&rsquo;re Lune Ruschia students.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were probably the bad men who kidnapped Tanaka-san...no, Miss Airi.</p>

<p>They were wearing black masks, but I could tell that they were in a great panic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take their weapons and tie them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the command of the man who seemed to be the leader of the group, our rings and tools were taken away from us, and we were tied up with ropes, just like Miss Airi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should we do with them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gag them and turn them over for now. They&rsquo;re first-years. If they can&rsquo;t chant incantations, they can&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a piece of cloth was wrapped around our mouths and we were roughly rolled around the place. The leader man took out a gun from his breast pocket and pointed it at Miss Airi, not caring about us at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a weapon from a foreign country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said with a sneer on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, my lovely Savior. If you accept our proposal, you will not be inconvenienced any further. However, if you don&rsquo;t accept it, then you&rsquo;re just a hindrance. Please consider your life forfeit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I told you over and over, I will not do what you terrorists say. Trying to make me abandon the duty of the Savior&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, brat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leader man was enraged and reflexively shot his gun. It grazed Miss Airi&rsquo;s sidelocks and pierced through the wall behind her.</p>

<p>But Miss Airi didn&rsquo;t move. Her strong-willed eyes irritated the man more and more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Savior! I don&rsquo;t believe in people from other worlds in the first place! We can&rsquo;t leave this country under the care of a king who clings to some suspicious legend&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man kicked an old chair, and it slid to us who were obediently in the corner. His gaze slowly moved towards us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Right...let&rsquo;s kill the students there one by one. That should change our kind Savior&rsquo;s opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh no. At this rate, we would be killed one by one like side characters, just as Miss Airi said. We had no rings, our mouths were sealed, and we couldn&rsquo;t use any magic worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The leader man first looked down at me, the weakest-looking girl in the group, his frame hanging over me. It was to strike fear into the other person.</p>

<p>But I pretended to be afraid of the man&rsquo;s gaze and looked away, making brief eye contact with Nero next to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful young lady, what is a student of Lune Ruschia doing in a place like this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how shall I kill you. I think it should be painful and brutal enough to break the heart of an impertinent girl from another world. Poor thing, because you came to this place&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While thrusting the gun into my chest, the man&rsquo;s other hand touched my cheek.</p>

<p>An ordinary girl would be terrified enough to cry, but I was actually waiting for this moment.</p>

<p>Because, my skin was&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyaaaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man suddenly screamed and immediately withdrew his hand, twisting his body in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hand, my hand&#8230;!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His fingertips were horribly burned, and there was dark smoke rising from them.</p>

<p>I was blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;. When I got excited, my skin became hot enough to burn.</p>

<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been able to control this power more and more, so I can also consciously burn anything that touched me.</p>

<p>The man was indignant as he looked at me again with his face twisted in pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell did you do? What is this&mdash;&mdash;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I was looking up at him too. Thanks to the high-quality Pon eye drops, my witch&rsquo;s eyes were tinged with a much more conspicuous magical power.</p>

<p>As though he was being glared at by a snake, the man stiffened.</p>

<p>Right after that, the ropes that bound us were removed. When the enemy was distracted and there was an opening, Nero broke the rope&rsquo;s binding spell. Frey kicked off against the wall next to him, retrieved our tools that were quickly taken by the enemy, and threw my ring to me.</p>

<p>I caught it, took off the cloth that bound my mouth, and bared my teeth into a grin.</p>

<p>And then I chanted a magic incantation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mel vis makia&mdash;&mdash;Ropes, rampage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I used the ropes that bound us, made them dance violently, and hit the enemy like whips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uwaaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The enemy men curled up their bodies at this attack, now unable to do anything except for protecting themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyaah, are you gonna whip us too!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said I was sorry, Frey. I just can&rsquo;t control it finely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since Nero cast a protective wall magic, our bodies were protected from the attack as we headed for Miss Airi who was alongside the wall. Nero had already untied her ropes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Miss Airi. We can&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to find this place unless we do something ourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Airi looked like she wanted to say something, but she sighed and followed us, perhaps thinking that her knights won&rsquo;t be able to rescue her splendidly in such a chaotic situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry! The protective wall magic is going to wear off soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Nero&rsquo;s call, we hurriedly left the hut.</p>

<p>And then we ran and ran and ran, and escaped. While still having no idea where we were, or who were those guys.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4></p>

<p> &ldquo;Haa, haa, haa...If we run this far, they definitely won&rsquo;t come after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. This place seems to be an island, and if we don&rsquo;t have a way to get back to the herb garden island, then it&rsquo;ll be like we&rsquo;re still in their hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had escaped to the edge of the coast, but this was a smaller island than I expected.</p>

<p>Unless we continued to run and find a place to hide, we would be found in time.</p>

<p>But at that moment, Nero pointed to the sky.</p>

<p>I thought there was a dot in the blue sky, but it slowly grew bigger, and by the time I saw that it was a person riding a pegasus flying in the sky, they had gallantly descended.</p>

<p>It was a dignified knight with ultramarine hair, his burly body dressed in the uniform of the royal palace knights.</p>

<p>That knight ran to Airi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you unharmed, Lady Airi?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was checking her condition, looking panicked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Miss Airi slapped the knight&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>It was a loud sound, so we were startled as we watched from the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re late, Lionel! You&rsquo;re my knight, so why didn&rsquo;t you find me sooner!? I was so scared! I was chanting &lsquo;Save me, save me,&rsquo; over and over again in my mind&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight with ultramarine hair suddenly knelt down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am truly sorry! This is my fault as the leader of the Guardians. After losing sight of you in the capital, the entire order has been searching for you everywhere, but the enemy has sent you through countless transference devices to get you to this place&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about Thor!? Why isn&rsquo;t Thor here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Airi interrupted the knight called Lionel as he was talking.</p>

<p>Thor. When Miss Airi said that name, I looked up without thinking.</p>

<p>The knight still had his head down as he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor is currently searching another area.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps there was something different from what she had imagined, as Miss Airi breathed a long sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;m...tired. I haven&rsquo;t eaten anything since yesterday. I can&rsquo;t wait to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes, let us return, Lady Airi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I understand...it&rsquo;s because I sneaked out of the palace without permission. I&rsquo;m sorry, Lionel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight called Lionel gently hugged the crying Miss Airi. They stayed like that for a while before finally noticing us standing stock still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Lune Ruschia students?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one was willing to explain, so I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. We got caught up in a transference spell on the school&rsquo;s herb garden island, and we got sent to this island. Where exactly is this place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an uninhabited island to the southwest, far away from Miladriede. I see. So the enemy installed a transfer device on the herb garden island to travel to and from here&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight called Lionel got a dour look on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell are those guys? They&rsquo;re still on the island, those black mask guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight suddenly looked up and seemed shocked to see Frey, but his face immediately tightened and he said, &ldquo;There is no need to worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Order has almost arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before we knew it, there were knights on pegasi in the sky above us.</p>

<p>They, bearing the coat of arms of the Order of the Royal Palace, rushed onto the island. We were taken aback by that dynamic sight, but the dark-haired* knight turned towards us again, put his hand to his chest and greeted us.</p>

<p> (TN: For some reason the text says he has brown hair here?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Lionel Fabray. I am the vice commander of the Order of the Royal Palace, and one of the Guardians protecting Lady Airi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had a feeling from the way Miss Airi was acting that he was Thor&rsquo;s colleague. No, if he was the vice commander then he could be called his superior. And yet, a Guardian&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were able to discover this island because of that &lsquo;emergency signal&rsquo; light while searching the area. It flew to Lune Ruschia, but in times of emergency, the signal would also be transmitted to us, the Order of the Royal Palace. We hastened here because...we thought it might have something to do with Lady Airi, who had been missing since yesterday and left no trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Lionel asked us several questions, which we answered precisely. He grasped the situation with just that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Students. Although you were unintentionally involved in this, you rescued Lady Airi successfully. I cannot thank you enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bowed again. The vice commander of the Order of the Royal Palace seemed to be a polite and humble person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to learn your names, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Frey Levi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nero Pachelbel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Makia O&rsquo;Drielle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since he might be Thor&rsquo;s superior, I bent my knees lightly and greeted him politely.</p>

<p>Hearing the name O&rsquo;Drielle, Miss Airi&rsquo;s and Sir Lionel&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly. &ldquo;I see. ...So it was you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Airi muttered with somewhat empty eyes. But soon she was all smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Lionel. These kids were amazing! They fought bravely and rescued me. We&rsquo;ll have to repay them somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, precisely, Lady Airi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think magic school students rescuing the Savior is something wonderful that deserves a medal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes. I shall propose it to His Highness another time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so Lionel put Miss Airi on his pegasus and left us to the care of the pegasi of another order, and we were taken to the royal capital Miladriede.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the order repeatedly asked us several questions and checked to make sure that we weren&rsquo;t hypnotized.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t explain in detail how they searched the island we were transported to or how much of the enemy they captured, but at the very least, the ringleader escaped.</p>

<p>It seemed that this uninhabited island had several of those foreign transfer devices set up on it, and the ringleader must have been able to escape quickly. Who exactly were those black masked villains in the first place&#8230;?</p>

<p>Since we were students, we could not be informed or involved in this matter any further. Eventually, the professors came to pick us up at the palace, and we were able to return to Lune Ruschia the next day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone, are you all okay!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lapis!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis, who we were separated from in the cave, was safely at school.</p>

<p>When we found each other, we hugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness you&rsquo;re okay as well! You&rsquo;re not hurt or anything, are you!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not at all. I&rsquo;m rather sorry that I couldn&rsquo;t do anything, even though I know transference magic well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis didn&rsquo;t look very good.</p>

<p>She must have been so scared for so long after we disappeared from that place. She might not have been able to eat or sleep much. We caused her to worry greatly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over...we weren&rsquo;t able to hand in the potion, and our ranking is dead last. I&rsquo;m captured by Team 1 now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time, Nero&rsquo;s face is filled with grim resolve. So much that Frey even wrapped his arm around his shoulders and comforted him with, &ldquo;Well, whatever happens, happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;s the end of the world, Nero! This time we were caught up in a strange incident, so it must not count.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also desperately comforted him. As the team leader, I couldn&rsquo;t let go of a valuable team member.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you talking about that? I submitted the Pon eye drops we made right on time. Not all the team members could make it back in time, but Professor Medite said he would rate us based on those eye drops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few seconds later,</p>

<p>&ldquo;L-Lapis~~!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We hugged Lapis with gratitude and respect. Nero was relieved from the bottom of his heart, and Frey was grinning.</p>

<p>The first field training session for us Team 9 was successfully completed, and we had completed our task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even so, we&rsquo;ve had a rough time of it. ...That captive princess was cute, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frey, aren&rsquo;t you an older lady killer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my judgment, that girl&rsquo;s older. Her clothes are weird and she was saying some things that made no sense, but daydreaming, helpless, and selfish older ladies are pretty great too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t care about Frey&rsquo;s preferences, but it was true that she was older. She was originally a high school third-year.</p>

<p>Frey&rsquo;s instincts were sharp for this kind of thing.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4></p>

<p>The next day, the results for this time&rsquo;s off-campus field training were posted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To our astonishment, Team 9 was in second place. First place was Team 1 led by Beatrice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-how...We made such excellent eye drops. Excellent enough to give us eyesight that paralyzed the enemy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were so shocked that we froze for a while. Then, Frey hurriedly pulled on the robe of Nero, who was quietly trying to throw himself out the window.</p>

<p>Apparently, our potion was perfectly executed, but the problem was our actions. We were given minus points for carelessly advancing towards the back of the cave behind the waterfall.</p>

<p>This field training wasn&rsquo;t just for Potions, but also Magical Athletics. Professor Lila marked that strictly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard about what happened this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the distinct sound of clacking footsteps, she came up to us with a triumphant look on her face. With her team members in tow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...B-Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We tensed up.</p>

<p>Beatrice smiled self-importantly, but looked around at us who were injured everywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been troublesome to be caught in the transference magic the villain had set up. As a result, we are in first place. I&rsquo;m sure you must be very disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grr&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While thinking about how when I&rsquo;m frustrated, I really say &ldquo;Grr&rdquo; out loud,</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, it is true that you have been through a lot. It&rsquo;s a miracle that you were able to come back alive at all, and according to rumors, you rescued the girl the villains kidnapped. To show my respect, I shall leave Mr. Nero to your team for now. Well, if I don&rsquo;t do at least that, then there would be no rivalry worth having either, right? Ohohohohohoho!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>With even more self-important laughter than usual, she left.</p>

<p>The way she said it was irritating, and she was interminably prideful, but her judgment of things was very much like a magician&rsquo;s, and as a result, Nero would be staying with our team. ...The person in question was looking up to the heavens.</p>

<p> It was after I returned to my room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis finally asked as I was prowling around everywhere in our room, turning over pillows and looking under desks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Donsuke isn&rsquo;t here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the...yellow dwarf hamster spirit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were spirits, and they were free-spirited ham-chans who willfully returned to their cage, went into my hood, and crawled into my basket, but I let them do what they wanted, and before I knew it, the yellow Donsuke was missing.</p>

<p>Only the white Popotarou was in the cage, and I couldn&rsquo;t find the yellow Donsuke no matter where I searched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible that I left him on that uninhabited island. I left him in my robe pocket, and maybe the transference magic sent him somewhere else. What should I do, I have to go back and look for him&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm down, Makia. You can summon contracted spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We learned it in Spirit Magic Studies, but once a spirit was contracted, it can be summoned back to your side with a simple re-summoning spell. I made a summoning circle at my feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myr vis makia&mdash;&mdash;Return to me, Dontanates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All I had to do was to order him with his official name.</p>

<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t Donsuke who jumped out of the magic circle. A blackboard fringed with flowers came to a standstill in front of me, and chalk letters appeared on the surface.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rsquo;On a mission&rsquo;...?&rdquo;*</p>

<p> (TN: This is written in hiragana)</p>

<p>Lapis and I stared at it and checked it over and over again.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on? Did I order Donsuke to do something?</p>

<p>In any case, I was worried, and I went to ask Professor Ulysses of Spirit Magic Studies.</p>

<p></p>

<p> Professor Ulysses was sitting on the edge of an artificial pond in a glass-enclosed greenhouse located on the school grounds called the Crystal Palace, looking into the water surface with white water lilies floating on top of it.</p>

<p>The sunset could be seen through the glass, and the water was beautiful as it reflected that crimson. The professor was also enveloped by some mysterious magic.</p>

<p>His expression was tinged with sorrow, and he seemed to be murmuring something. Was there something in the water?</p>

<p>Beautiful richly colored airfish were swimming around him, returning to the pond and flying out of it to swim in the air.</p>

<p>I gulped at this fantastical and relaxed time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noticing me, the professor took on a teacher&rsquo;s expression, the one he had when he was teaching a class.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Miss Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Professor Ulysses. ...Is this a good time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think he was talking to someone in the water, but&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, fufu. I was talking to Headmaster Pan just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, the headmaster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Headmaster Pan&rsquo;s goat face appeared out of the water. I couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a &ldquo;Gyah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Makia O&rsquo;Drielle. This is our first time speaking face to face with each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Y-Yes. How do you do, Headmaster Pan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bit nervous, I plucked up my robe and greeted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you. You have run into quite a bit of trouble the other day. It is due to our oversight that a transfer device was set up on an herb garden island managed by the school. In order to prevent such an incident from happening again, the school is determined to investigate the cause and take all possible precautions. Please be at ease and study hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all Headmaster Pan said before hurriedly going back into the water.</p>

<p>It was a mirror at the entrance ceremony, but...where exactly was Headmaster Pan&rsquo;s main body?</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, you wished to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses moved the sleeves of his loose-fitting white robe, asked me to sit down next to him, and asked me again. I sat down next to him and began talking about the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one of my spirits has gone off somewhere. I tried re-summoning him, but a message came out saying that he&rsquo;s &lsquo;in the middle of a mission.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I talked about how the two spirits were in my basket until halfway through the field training. I talked about how after I returned to school, the yellow dwarf hamster Dontanates had disappeared. I talked about how even when I tried asking the white Popoloactus, he just looked at me blankly and didn&rsquo;t give me an answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Professor Ulysses put his hand on his chin and thought for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirits have the ability to make their own judgments. Perhaps he sensed that there is something you think you need and is in the middle of accomplishing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something I need? I had no idea what that was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are spirits who leave their master and carry out long tasks. For instance, Headmaster Pan, whose face was floating like a drowned body earlier, was ordered by the &lsquo;White Sage&rsquo; five hundred years ago to protect this magic school. He believes that that magician will return here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drowned body?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirits can&rsquo;t forget a master they once served and are faithful to their orders. Even if they don&rsquo;t have orders, if they feel that it is needed, they will try to fulfill their role. To a tragic degree&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses was looking up at the sparkly ceiling of the Crystal Palace, but then knitted his brows together and smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, will Donsuke...Dontanates return to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. After he finishes his duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses smiled kindly at me, who was out of my mind with worry and admonished me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dontanates and Popoloactus are twins, always together. Wherever one is, they are drawn to the other like magnets. Therefore, once you find Dontanates, think carefully about why he is &lsquo;there.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure it will be very important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those two are excellent, your supporters. I know that very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I mean is that you can be rest assured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses&rsquo; words were meaningful, but also strangely comforting.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what Donsuke is doing and where, but I hoped he would come back to me soon.</p>

<p></p>

<p> Afterwards, I completed difficult classes every day, several field training sessions and experiments with my team members, and had just finished our end-of-term tests.</p>

<p>Donsuke still hadn&rsquo;t returned yet, but a person who seemed like a messenger from the palace came to us. They said that all of us in Team 9 were invited to the upcoming summer ball at the palace.</p>

<p>I had thought I couldn&rsquo;t enter the royal palace unless I became an honor student, but it never occurred to me that I would be invited to a ball for rescuing the Savior.</p>
