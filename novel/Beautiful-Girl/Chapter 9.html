<h2>Chapter 29: The Young Lady's Guard</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>&quot;She doesn't need a guard, right? I mean, she could finish everything off in one punch. Just a flick to my forehead would blow my head off.&quot;</p>

<p>An S-Rank is a being beyond human understanding.</p>

<p>It's a monster that could potentially destroy a nation all by itself.</p>

<p>It can deflect bullets with its eyes and scoffs at modern weaponry.</p>

<p>I wish they wouldn't say such foolish things like guarding such a monster, of which there are only a few in Japan.</p>

<p>Does an elephant that is attacked by a mouse need a guard?</p>

<p>It doesn't, right? Because the opponent is no match at all.</p>

<p>&quot;But the thing is... she can't fight. Or rather, she doesn't have the power.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>I frowned at Tanaka-san's statement.</p>

<p>What does it mean that she has S-Rank magical power but can't fight?</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know exactly. It's true that she has that much magic power according to the measurement. But her physical strength isn't much different from an ordinary person. The cause is unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, I want you to take a look at her. You might be able to figure out the cause with those eyes of yours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, so that's the real motive, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, I like smart kids, as long as they're on my side.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to accept the request. I'm simply interested.</p>

<p>It doesn't make sense to be weak with that much magical power.</p>

<p>An S-Rank, a godlike existence, being no different from an ordinary person, what kind of joke is that?</p>

<p>Then I found out the plan, that I will be diving into the dungeon with the chairman's granddaughter this coming Saturday. Until then, I decided to continue using Mirage to clear D-Rank dungeons without getting caught. That said, there are various preparations needed, like Tanaka-san making arrangements so that no other clearers would enter.</p>

<p>&#9671; And then, the day of the promise arrived. Saturday, noon.</p>

<p>I was preparing to go to the cube that connects to the C-Rank dungeon in Tokyo, the meeting place.</p>

<p>It was hot, but since I was technically a guard, I decided to wear black pants and a button-down shirt.</p>

<p>It didn't really feel like exploring, but that's okay, being easy to move in doesn't matter much.</p>

<p>&quot;...But still...&quot;</p>

<p>I struck a pose in front of the mirror.</p>

<p>My abs were defined, or should I say, didn't I get into pretty good shape?</p>

<p>My physique had changed like that of a sports athlete.</p>

<p>This was magic power... it was mysterious.</p>

<p>Was the magic optimizing my body to make it easier to move?</p>

<p>And also, maybe it was because I was doing quite intense workouts every day and eating a lot. Come to think of it, there are no fat dungeon clearers...</p>

<p>&quot;I have a few hours until the meeting time, maybe I should get a haircut. I've been getting the 1000 yen cuts, but maybe I should do it properly for once.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to change my clothes and go out.</p>

<p>My hair had grown out and was getting bushy, so I thought about going short and headed to a slightly stylish salon in front of the station.</p>

<p>I had a lot of extra money, thanks to the rewards from clearing the D-Rank dungeon and the magic stones that Tanaka-san had cashed for me.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm pretty well off right now.</p>

<p>I can eat as much beef bowl as I want, and my electricity and gas doesn&rsquo;t get cut off.</p>

<p>That's normal? You don't know real poverty yet.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome!&quot;</p>

<p>I went to a stylish salon near the station.</p>

<p>I felt out of place and needed courage to enter, but I had no choice.</p>

<p>I wasn't familiar with being stylish.</p>

<p>The shop attendant, a lady, smiled brightly at me with a high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>She was a fashionable and beautiful lady, she also smelled really good. Maybe she was wearing perfume?</p>

<p>&quot;It's my first time here, is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course! Please, come in!!&quot;</p>

<p>I was guided to a seat.</p>

<p>I had never done anything fashionable, so I just said I'll leave everything up to you, and then just zoned out.</p>

<p>Why do the attendants in these kinds of places always try so hard to make conversation?</p>

<p>&quot;You have an amazing body; do you work out?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not really. Well, I am a dungeon clearer, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? That's amazing!! I'm an E-Rank, so please protect me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, I'll do my best.&quot;</p>

<p>I just sat there and let her cut my hair, I wonder if it's a trendy hairstyle.</p>

<p>She cut it quite short, but I could see around me much more clearly, this should make fighting easier.</p>

<p>Then, the lady stared at me through the mirror with a blank expression.</p>

<p>&quot;You look amazing! It's like I'm seeing a different person! You're so handsome! No, really, would you consider becoming a haircut model in the future?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>The lady was very complimentary, using polite phrases to praise me a lot, but I didn't mind. I politely declined the offer to become a haircut model, but I promised her that I would come back to get my hair cut here again.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you very much!! I look forward to seeing you again, Amachi-san!!&quot;</p>

<p>The lady kept waving at me with a smile. I almost misunderstood her intentions, but quickly shook my head and forgot about it.</p>

<p>I've seen a lot of painful experiences due to misunderstandings in my life so far, so I decided not to read too much into it. Me, popular with women? No way.</p>

<p>I remembered the memories from my student days that I wanted to seal away.</p>

<p>The times when I was bullied, laughed at, and becoming hated by girls just for having feeling for them.</p>

<p>&#12302;Ugh! I've been touched by Amachi, the Unranked! ~&#12303;</p>

<p>I had received such harsh words.</p>

<p>I got a little gloomy when I remembered, so I decided to forget it right away.</p>

<p>&quot;It's 10 minutes until the meeting time. Is that it? C-Rank... commonly known as the Sakura Cube. It's pink and pretty...&quot;</p>

<p>The dungeon we're heading to today is located among a cluster of busy buildings.</p>

<p>A barricade is set up, and a person in a black suit, probably a staff member of the dungeon association, is guarding it.</p>

<p>I want to say &quot;good work in this damn heat&quot;, but that's the formal attire of the Dungeon Association, so it can't be helped. They're public servants who fight.</p>

<p>Maybe they came here today specifically for the protection of Aya Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>I head to the meeting place where the clearers are gathered.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? You must be the rumored Kai-kun! Nice to meet you! I'm Masuda, I'll be leading today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>I shake hands with Masuda, who greets me with a smile so white and refreshing it seems like he whitens his teeth.</p>

<p>He is a B-Rank clearer affiliated with Avalon, and today's leader.</p>

<p>He carries a large sword and has a big body. He looks very strong and seems like a good person. Maybe he's in his late 20s? His hair is dyed, giving off a slightly dashing, older-brother vibe.</p>

<p>I greet the other C-Rank clearers as well.</p>

<p>I've seen many of them at the headquarters, but this is the first time I've talked to them.</p>

<p>However, all of them have good personalities, as expected of Avalon, they even care about the inner character of their employees.</p>

<p>&quot;But we got a strange request this time. Never thought we'd be guarding the Chairman's granddaughter. Basically, Mizuguchi and I will take the lead. Other members, please stay alert and surround Ryuenji-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood.&quot;</p>

<p>The strategy was simple: Masuda-san, a B-Rank, and Mizuguchi-san, a top C-Rank, would clear the dungeon, and the remaining three of us just had to protect Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>As for me, I wanted to fight monsters too, but if I could understand what was going on inside by looking at the status, I would bear with it.</p>

<p>We held a strategy meeting while looking at the map of the inside.</p>

<p>About 30 minutes after the strategy meeting ended, it arrived.</p>

<p>A gigantic limousine, as if to say the longer, the more important.</p>

<p>I was surprised that such a long vehicle could navigate the narrow streets of this country, but the driver's skill must be considerable, he could probably attempt the public road fastest theory mode.[1]</p>

<p>The driver, with his plump lips [2], opened the door, and a woman appeared from inside.</p>

<p>Her black hair, which reached down to her waist, was well taken care of and silky smooth.</p>

<p>A beautiful and expensive-looking red earring swayed ominously in her ear.</p>

<p>Her makeup was minimal, just natural.</p>

<p>Despite this, her features were so good, her eyes so intense, that I instinctively averted my gaze.</p>

<p>Her clothes seemed easy to move in, but they were all black.</p>

<p>Perhaps she likes black, but those clothes are probably equipment woven with high-level magic. Moreover, despite her all-black attire, the bright red gemstone necklace hanging around her neck was very impressive. That must be a magic stone.</p>

<p>&quot;She looks even more beautiful up close...&quot;</p>

<p>I was captivated.</p>

<p>This is what they mean when they say someone carries themselves well. Just walking, she exuded grace, like a model.</p>

<p>Still, she gave off the air of an aristocratic lady.</p>

<p>She crossed her arms, struck a condescending pose, and assessed us with sharp eyes.</p>

<p>Rather than aristocratic lady, it might be more accurate to say she's like a queen. There&rsquo;s no awkwardness in her demeanor, one that was instilled due to being made to stand above people since birth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the slight thrill I feel might be because, while she has the qualities of a queen, I have a servile nature ingrained in me.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nice to meet you, I'm Aya Ryuenji. Thank you for agreeing to participate today despite the inconvenience. Let's get going then. We don't want to waste time.&quot;</p>

<p>With just a glance, the girl transformed into our leader and began walking briskly towards the Cube.</p>

<p>I looked at Aya Ryuenji-san&rsquo;s status from behind.</p>

<p>Then I realized why, despite having godlike magical power, she only has the strength of an ordinary person.</p>

<p>&quot;...I see, that's your status.&quot;</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I understood as I looked at her status.</p>

<p>Name: Aya Ryuenji</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: Artifacter&#12304;Awakened&#12305;</p>

<p>Skill(s): Artifact Creation Lv1</p>

<p>Magic Power: 325,040</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;0%=0</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;0%=0</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;0%=0</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;200%=650,080</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Black Dragons&rsquo;s Feather Robe: Defense +2000</p>

<p>&#12539;Crimson Eye Dragon&rsquo;s Magic Stone (Incomplete)</p>

<p>She seemed to have a special profession. There was not even one Artifacter among the clearers of Avalon.</p>

<p>But, guessing from the name, it would be something that creates, like the profession of a weaponsmith, which exists in a certain number, and there was also one in Tanaka-san&rsquo;s guild.</p>

<p>People with professions that can create equipment imbued with magic power.</p>

<p>So, what does the term &ldquo;artifact&rdquo; refer to?</p>

<p>Moreover, the profession is &ldquo;awakened&rdquo;? Is that something above advanced?</p>

<p>All these words that I don&rsquo;t know at all are coming out.</p>

<p>I further stared at the profession of Artifacter.</p>

<p>I might understand something if I look at the details.</p>

<p>Type: Job</p>

<p>Title: Artifacter</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: S</p>

<p>Effect: A job with the ability to create equipment which effects magic power reflection rate</p>

<p>Creation Method: Cannot be displayed due to an insufficient Access Right level.</p>

<p>Type: Skill</p>

<p>Title: Artifact Creation Lv1</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: S</p>

<p>Effect: Ability to create equipment which effects magic power reflection rate. Quality is influenced by level and intelligence. Level is raised in response to the amount of items created.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I don&rsquo;t really get it. And an intelligence of 640,000 is too monstrous, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even after reading the skill description, I still didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>But if I read it as it is, it might mean that she can make equipment that changes the percentage of converting magic power to attack power.</p>

<p>As I was zoning out and considering this, looking at Aya-san, I was called by the young lady who had briskly moved ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amachi-san, was it? Could you hurry up, please? I don&rsquo;t want to waste time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, s-sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bow my head and jog up to her. (She&rsquo;s a scary kid&#8230; Is she really the same age as me? Really?)</p>

<p>The young lady, who seemed completely uninterested, immediately moved her gaze from me to the Cube.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ryuenji-san, this is today&rsquo;s map of the Cube.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Masuda-san, the leader, tried to hand over a printed paper map to the young lady.</p>

<p>However, with her arms crossed, Ryuenji-san refused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ve remembered it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of it is quite complicated though&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Please don&rsquo;t make me say it twice. I&rsquo;ve remembered it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san glared back at Masuda-san, who had spoken back to her, with eyes so sharp they seemed like they could shoot beams.</p>

<p>Again, I thought, she&rsquo;s scary.</p>

<p>Her cold eyes, like those of a queen, made me forget that she&rsquo;s the same age as me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ex, excuse me. Well then, let&rsquo;s go! I will guide you, Ryuenji-sama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Masuda-san bowed and groveled.</p>

<p>He had already started calling her &ldquo;Ryuzenji-sama,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s already been tamed huh. Amen.</p>

<p>Even so, it&rsquo;s not that her attitude is bad, but her words are strong and scary.</p>

<p>Yet, there&rsquo;s no awkwardness in that; she indeed has a natural queen-like demeanor.</p>

<p>Seeing Masuda-san looking pleased, I wonder if this is the joy of submission.</p>

<p>Indeed, it feels a bit naughty to be dominated by a younger beauty.</p>

<p>In other words, she was a high school student until last year, and it might be a crime, isn&rsquo;t it, Masuda-san?</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san walks towards the Cube.</p>

<p>A pink Cube extending a C-Rank dungeon.</p>

<p>The so-called Sakura Cube is as beautiful as a pink diamond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a dungeon&#8230; It&rsquo;s beautiful&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing in front of the Cube, Ryuenji-san sighed.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Cube is beautiful, glittering like a gem.</p>

<p>Especially the cherry blossom color gives off an air of femininity, but the inside isn&rsquo;t as sweet as it seems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eek!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment Ryuenji-san touched the Cube, it rippled like a wave spreading across the water surface with a cool sound.</p>

<p>A cute voice that shouldn&rsquo;t have been heard came from somewhere, and everyone looked at Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>Then Ryuenji-san blushed and coughed a little louder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm!! Let&rsquo;s go then. Masuda-san, give the instructions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood! Ryuenji-sama!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then we headed for the dungeon. Enclosing Ryuenji-san in the center, we entered the Cube.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, and inside was a cave-type dungeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, this is the inside of a dungeon&#8230; It&rsquo;s strange. I can&rsquo;t understand it at all, the teleportation&#8230; magic too, even if I can use it, I don&rsquo;t understand the principle at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san started walking around as if surveying the surroundings.</p>

<p>Touching the walls, touching the floor, it was as if she was doing research.</p>

<p>That reminded me, I heard Tanaka-san is a researcher who has published papers abroad.</p>

<p>A multilingual master, flying around the world while still a high school student.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a demon emerged from the shadows.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a higher species of goblin, dressed in tribal-like clothes and had a physique like a professional wrestler.</p>

<p>But it was killed in one shot by Masuda-san.</p>

<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a C-Rank, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a match for a B-Rank.</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san then touched the fallen demon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, this is a monster. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve touched one in a dungeon&#8230; It has the correct internal organs&#8230; and an instinct to violate women. Why? Why does it attack people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ryuenji-san rolled up her sleeves and stuck her hand into the corpse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magic stones, they&rsquo;re in the same place as described in the literature&#8230; Masuda-san, I got dirty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! With my clothes&mdash;ahem. Excuse me. Hey, Kai-kun! Take out a towel from the luggage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took a towel out of the luggage I was holding and tried to hand it to Ryuenji-san along with some water.</p>

<p>However, Ryuenji-san held out her white, pristine, beautiful and supple arm to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tilted my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please pour it. I can&rsquo;t let go of my hand right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san, who said so, was looking at the magic stone from various angles with interested eyes. Her concentration was so intense that she didn&rsquo;t even notice me.</p>

<p>She took out her phone, took photos, and was desperately taking notes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, okay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I splashed cold water and wiped the blood off with a towel.</p>

<p>Despite being thin, there was a softness that was unmistakably a woman&rsquo;s body. The thought made my heart flutter a bit.</p>

<p>Next to me, Masuda-san looked envious, but I told her, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been on the verge of committing a crime for a while now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dungeon exploration continued smoothly.</p>

<p>Although it didn&rsquo;t progress as quickly as we wanted because Ryuenji-san was interested in investigating anything that came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems like nothing will happen at this rate, good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dungeon exploration went on without a hitch.</p>

<p>After all, it&rsquo;s just a C-Rank dungeon, and we let our guard down thinking nothing would happen.</p>

<p>I was the same, thinking everything would end without incident.</p>

<p>But we didn&rsquo;t yet understand the meaning of our escort mission.</p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t understand the real reason why Aya Ryuenji needed protection, and the fact that there are things in this world scarier than monsters.</p>

<p>&#9671; At the same time, outside</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah&#8230; I&rsquo;m sleepy. This is boring&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are at the Cube of the C-Rank dungeon that we&rsquo;re clearing.</p>

<p>The dungeon association staff on guard duty here are all D-Rank or lower. They generally handle dungeon-related tasks, but don&rsquo;t do the clearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped since the young lady is clearing. It&rsquo;s the chairman&rsquo;s order&#8230; Although the chairman is in New York now, meeting with representatives from all over the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hearing, &rsquo;I&rsquo;m going as well!&rsquo; got annoying. He&rsquo;s way too energetic for his age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haha, he could still be in his prime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. The name &lsquo;Fist God&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two guards were yawning while laughing and chatting.</p>

<p>Still, they were vigilant to make sure no one touched the Cube.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when it happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vision of one of the guards darkened, and the light in the world disappeared momentarily.</p>

<p>He looked around thinking something was wrong, but in an instant, the world returned to normal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh, what? A plane? It got dark for a moment&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought it got really dark all of a sudden&#8230; Huh? Was it just my imagination?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haha, are you tired? The sky&rsquo;s been clear all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is, is that so&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rubbing his eyes and tilting his head, wondering if he was mistaken, he returned to his guard duty.</p>

<p>&#9671; Inside the dungeon</p>

<p>Something wrapped in a black robe entered the dungeon.</p>

<p>Cloaked in jet black, enshrouded in darkness, unnoticed by anyone.</p>

<p>The man began to run as soon as he entered.</p>

<p>Unnoticed by all the monsters.</p>

<p>His figure was like.</p>

<p>The &#12302;darkness&#12303; itself.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The boss room is getting close, what do you think, Ryuenji-sama?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230; I&rsquo;m reluctant to leave, but let&rsquo;s proceed with the clear. I have seen enough of what I wanted to see. Thank you for today. I had a very meaningful time thanks to everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, Ryuenji-san bowed her head to everyone.</p>

<p>In the short time we&rsquo;ve been clearing together, I realized that she speaks strongly and can even seem arrogant, but she is fundamentally very polite and a good person.</p>

<p>Well, I did think it was a bit strange that she let an unfamiliar man wipe her arm, but she was probably raised over-protected.</p>

<p>She might be a bit out of sync with the general public, but I quite liked her.</p>

<p>If I thought of her as a cool, aloof lady, she seemed cute.</p>

<p>What do you call this? Tsundere? Kuudere? I haven&rsquo;t seen the &lsquo;dere&rsquo; part yet though.</p>

<p>We shared a little laugh, Masuda-san shyly smiling and bobbing her head in embarrassment.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when we were laughing in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>

<p>(Huh? What was that just now&#8230;?)</p>

<p>That was the moment I felt a sense of discomfort.</p>

<p>It was more of a chill than discomfort.</p>

<p>As if a knife was touching the nape of my neck.</p>

<p>As if my heart was being squeezed.</p>

<p>The fear of death that I&rsquo;ve felt many times.</p>

<p>Being weaker than anyone else, I&rsquo;ve felt it more than anyone else.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a sense that you have because you weren&rsquo;t born strong, like the instinct of a small animal.</p>

<p>That must be why.</p>

<p>The chill as if a sword&rsquo;s tip was pointed at me&#8230; Suddenly my heart started to stir and&mdash;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not at all. I&rsquo;m honored to be with Ryuenji-sama and&#8230;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;I screamed to grab my weapon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cough!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Masuda-san!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the chest of Masuda-san, who was laughing in front of us, a black blade protruded.</p>

<p>Struck from behind, her heart was pierced, and the light vanished from Masuda-san&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Masuda-san, who had already turned into a lump of flesh, fell heavily in front of us, dumbstruck.</p>

<p>And what appeared from behind her was&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enemy!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frantically trying to clear my confused head, I shouted.</p>

<p>Indeed, the clearers affiliated with Avalon were well-trained and immediately readied their weapons, forming a circle to protect Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>Masuda-san&#8230; with that wound, she&rsquo;s probably dead on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Wh, what!? What the hell is happening!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mizuguchi-san shouted, and we looked at the enemy.</p>

<p>But at that moment.</p>

<p>The hand raised towards us, and the words muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly the world lost its light and plunged into darkness.</p>

<p>My vision blacked out, and the already dim cave became completely dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha!? Wh, what is this!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed our vision had been stolen.</p>

<p>In the pitch black, only the frantic voices of Mizuguchi-san and the other clearers could be heard.</p>

<p>Zashu.</p>

<p>It was a split second.</p>

<p>There was the sound of something being cut.</p>

<p>In the darkness, there were the sounds of a death cry and flesh being severed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an enemy!! They&rsquo;re running around us at an incredible speed!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one who shouted was Ryuenji-san, it seemed she could see.</p>

<p>However, including me, everyone&rsquo;s vision had blacked out, and all we could see was darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uwaaaah!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>What on earth was happening, why had our vision disappeared?</p>

<p>In a dark room, almost like an assassin.</p>

<p>Then, I remembered.</p>

<p>For enemies I can&rsquo;t see, maybe with this power&#8230;</p>

<p>So, I activated the Eye of God and focused my consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s these eyes, they should see through this.</p>

<p>My eyes shine with a golden glow, illuminating the darkness.</p>

<p>Within the darkness, two mirages flicker. One is the girl, shrinking beside me.</p>

<p>And the other&#8230; A black magic power is rapidly approaching me.</p>

<p>Then there&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guuh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230; You stopped it well. Is it intuition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an enemy.</p>

<p>The moment I recognized it, its form was visible to me. I barely deflect the blade aimed at my throat. The darkness breaks, and the enemy reveals itself to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you, who are you?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the man is stopped, he takes a step back from us and starts talking. He&rsquo;s dressed all in black, even when he removes his black robe. A foreigner, perhaps, with blond curly hair, and blue eyes looking at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230; darkness should be effective. Is it really intuition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stabs his black sword into the ground with one hand, tilts his head while resting his hand on his chin. I point my sword at the man in black and ask him again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer my question first. Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, you&rsquo;re right. I was rude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, the man bows to us as if he was offering a polite greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you, my name is Phu Yen. I came to kill the young lady there&#8230; you are just an afterthought. Goodbye&#8230; Darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man who introduced himself as Phu Yen whispers while bowing to me.</p>

<p>Light disappears from my world, and I&rsquo;m plunged into a pitch-black world.</p>

<p>But with these eyes of mine&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!? &#8230; It wasn&rsquo;t just a fluke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can see the magic-imbued entity.</p>

<p>I stop the descending sword again.</p>

<p>But to be honest, it was a close call. I can see it, but there&rsquo;s a significant difference in magic power.</p>

<p>However, the man, who was cautious because he didn&rsquo;t understand the reason, backed away from us for a moment, and light returned to the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you? This place should only have C-Ranks or B-Ranks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Tell me your objective, and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm, I thought I told you; my goal is to kill that young lady over there. To kill the daughter of the detestable Dungeon Association&rsquo;s Japanese chairman. On top of that, in terms of magic powers only, she&rsquo;s S-Rank. That&rsquo;s the mission given to me by him. This is for the sake of our great founder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ryuenji, who was in my arms, spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are probably the God-Destruction cult. They consider the Dungeon Association an enemy and are a mad cult that believes entities with superior magic power should rule the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God-Destruction cult? &#8230;Isn&rsquo;t that an extremely evil criminal organization?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I vocalize the name I had only heard on the news.</p>

<p>Whenever there&rsquo;s a major terror attack overseas, this cult is usually involved.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s considered the world&rsquo;s largest criminal organization, advocating that the powerful should dominate the weak, and they bear a grudge against the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&#8230; what did you just say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the man who introduced himself as Phu Yen changed his demeanor, which had been light until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you call us a criminal organization? Don&rsquo;t joke around!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly a surge of magic power, his anger seemed to shake the very dungeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are trying to liberate the world!! From the control of God! From the world stolen by that detestable God!! Why can&rsquo;t you understand this great cause!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Phu Yen, in a fit of rage, charges at me and swings his sword with pure force.</p>

<p>I push Ryuenji away to escape and raise my sword with both hands to block Phu Yen&rsquo;s attack.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gwaaa!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was sent flying.</p>

<p>Carried by momentum, I crash into the wall behind me. I slid down the wall and sat on the ground.</p>

<p>The impact forced all the air out of my lungs, and I almost lost consciousness.</p>

<p>Still, I lifted my face and looked at the status of the man named Phu Yen through the Eye of God.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been going through D-Rank dungeons for the past few weeks, nearly 50 times in total.</p>

<p>I can confidently say I&rsquo;ve completely conquered all the D-Rank Cubes in Kanto with the help of Tanaka, gaining 100 to 200 magic power each time.</p>

<p>As a result, my magic power has increased to nearly 6000.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the power treated as upper B-Rank.</p>

<p>But this opponent in front of me&#8230;&#12288;</p>

<p>Name: Phu Yen</p>

<p>State: Fanatic</p>

<p>Job: Magic Swordsman (Darkness) &#12304;Advanced&#12305;</p>

<p>&#12539;The Black Wolf&rsquo;s Pelt = Agility + 1,000</p>

<p>I checked the man&rsquo;s status with eyes about to lose consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-Rank&#8230; State is fanatic&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His state was written as fanatic.</p>

<p>But what&rsquo;s more important now is that his status is far above mine, which should have been trained up.</p>

<p>This man is one of the few high-ranking awakened.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s an enemy with A-Rank magic power, equivalent to Tanaka-san.</p>

<p>Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p>State: Good</p>

<p>&#12539;High Wolf&rsquo;s fang sword = Attack Power +120</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Phew&#8230; I got a bit excited there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen pushes Kai away with all his strength and then looks at the empty ceiling while hiding his face with his hand to calm himself.</p>

<p>He then started walking slowly towards Aya Ryuenji, twirling his black sword as if he couldn&rsquo;t wait to cut something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noble girl, intimidated by his smile that carried a hint of madness, sat on her backside.</p>

<p>A direct dose of real madness and murderous intent.</p>

<p>It was enough to break a person&rsquo;s spirit, even if that person possessed high magical power like Aya.</p>

<p>Watching her, Phu Yen kicked the head of Masuda, who was lying nearby, and it rolled towards the girl.</p>

<p>The severed head flew like a ball and hit Aya squarely in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ow!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blood flowed from her mouth where she bit her lip, and a bruise formed as if she had been punched in the cheek.</p>

<p>Seeing the rolling head in front of her and feeling that pain, Aya sensed it.</p>

<p>That death was close at hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that expression. The faces of God&rsquo;s puppets in fear are the best. I wish I could show this to your grandfather. I wonder what kind of face he would make, that annoying old soldier who refuses to die,&rdquo; Phu Yen said, looking at Aya&rsquo;s twisted face with a gleeful expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&#8230; why are you going to kill me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To spread our message to the world. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who it is, the more famous the better. By killing a lovely girl like you in a brutal way, the world will remember us. So, I&rsquo;ll make you into just a head and expose you to the world. I hope you&rsquo;ll be made into a laughingstock by the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen smiled at Aya with a full-faced smile.</p>

<p>His expression was the epitome of madness, not at all the kind of smile a person would have when they&rsquo;re happy.</p>

<p>His face, that of a fanatic, was enough to instill fear in Aya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My&#8230; my head&#8230; no&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to be beheaded? Well then, how about this. We&rsquo;ll cut off your limbs and keep you as a pet in our church. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful to broadcast that image to the world? Yes, that&rsquo;s a good idea. It sounds more fun than killing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen made a devilish proposal.</p>

<p>Aya felt nauseous just thinking about it.</p>

<p>It seemed more terrifying than death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, you seem to be quite attractive. Our church is mostly male, so I&rsquo;m sure everyone will be pleased. &#8230; Hehe. Well then, we don&rsquo;t have much time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, Phu Yen raised his sword and approached Aya.</p>

<p>Aya was already paralyzed with fear.</p>

<p>The noble figure was gone, and all that was left was a girl trembling with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aya shook her limbs, tears welling up in her eyes.</p>

<p>The emotion of fear dominated Aya&rsquo;s brain, making it impossible for her to think about anything else.</p>

<p>Aya, who had been raised over-protectively and didn&rsquo;t have much resistance to fear, found the terror she was experiencing for the first time so intense that she could barely breathe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as he was about to drop the raised sword straight down onto Aya.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, those long legs&#9472;gah!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl, who was simply watching Phu Yen with tearful eyes, saw him spin and fly sideways immediately after.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it&#8230; couldn&rsquo;t finish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out of nowhere, one of the guards appeared.</p>

<p>He appeared out of nowhere, as if he had been invisible.</p>

<p>On the sword he swung, there was a thick coat of red blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one who appeared was Kai Amachi, who had been lying in wait using Mirage.</p>

<p>Even though he had aimed for the perfect timing to aim for the neck with his sword, he was barely guarded, and by spinning while flying back, Phu Yen managed to reduce the damage.</p>

<p>Kai crouched in front of Aya and told her,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please listen calmly, Aya Ryuenji-san. You have a special power. The power to create equipment imbued with magical power. The power to create Artifacts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai removes the red necklace hanging from Aya&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>He makes Aya hold a large ruby-like object that looks like a big jewel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need your power. Believe in yourself! I don&rsquo;t know how, but you can surely do it if it&rsquo;s you! This magic stone is the medium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t have such power!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can! Believe in yourself!! If not&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai deflects a swung sword from the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will die here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repels a strike from Phu Yen, clad in black magic power like darkness.</p>

<p>Thus, the battle for life between Phu Yen and Kai began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haha, what a coincidence. You also have a power similar to mine, don&rsquo;t you? I almost got my neck cut off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kuh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen, dripping red blood from his cheek, clashes with Kai.</p>

<p>But Phu Yen is the one pushing forward.</p>

<p>As expected, the difference in magic power is absolute; Kai can&rsquo;t win against Phu Yen from the front.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, you seem weaker than me. As you know, the more difference there is in magic power, the weaker the effect of the skill! Even if it&rsquo;s a bit hard to see, unless it&rsquo;s a surprise attack, it won&rsquo;t be fatal!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai and Phu Yen clash.</p>

<p>There is indeed a difference in magic power.</p>

<p>Kai uses Mirage. Phu Yen uses Darkness.</p>

<p>Phu Yen&rsquo;s Darkness can be almost neutralized by the Eye of God.</p>

<p>Kai&rsquo;s Mirage is almost neutralized by the difference in magical power, to the extent that it obstructs recognition a bit.</p>

<p>That difference barely holds back against the absolute gap called magic power.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Phu Yen lowers his sword, takes a little distance, and asks me a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s strange. Why can you recognize me in the darkness? My power has almost no effect on higher-ranked opponents, but it has absolute power against lower-ranked ones, so I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen is puzzled. He is definitely more powerful.</p>

<p>During the battle he became convinced of this.</p>

<p>Despite this, his opponent is fighting while firmly recognizing his position.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t understand the reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a secret&#8230; I&rsquo;ll reveal it after I&rsquo;ve defeated you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see&#8230; But your power is gradually weakening. It seems that the recognition obstruction skill is also losing its effectiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that much; I&rsquo;ll defeat you by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hehe&#8230; okay. I thought it was an easy task, but I didn&rsquo;t expect to struggle so much. You&rsquo;re not just an assassination target, it seems you&rsquo;re an enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Saying that, Phu Yen sticks his sword into the ground.</p>

<p>And he bows with a beautiful gesture.</p>

<p>As if introducing himself, he does so politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I apologize for the hasty introduction earlier, assuming this would be over quickly. My name is Phu Yen. I have been appointed as a bishop of the God-Destruction Sect. My main job is to go around the world killing things that are disadvantageous to our sect. So? What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that terrible self-introduction. I am Kai Amachi, a clearer of this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai brandishes his sword and declares his name.</p>

<p>Perhaps he reflexively reciprocated because he was introduced to so courteously, but there should be no problem because it will either kill or be killed anyway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kai Amachi&#8230; I feel like I&rsquo;ve heard it somewhere&#8230; somewhere&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Phu Yen rests his chin on his hand and closes his eyes in thought.</p>

<p>Kai has no choice but to wait for Aya&rsquo;s artifact creation to succeed&#65293;he didn&rsquo;t even wish for a conversation.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what kind of effects an artifact has.</p>

<p>Even so, in this situation, there&rsquo;s no choice but to bet everything on that.</p>

<p>Moment by moment, the countdown to defeat ticks away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!! I remember now!! You&rsquo;re one of the participants of the golden Cube that fell in this country, right? You were supposed to be dead, but it was later said to be a paperwork error&#8230; could it be, you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!? You know about it? That Cube. What do you know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230; You were unranked, weren&rsquo;t you? Why? I&rsquo;m even more puzzled&#8230; perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen, who until a moment ago had a light-hearted atmosphere, now glares at me with more murderous intent than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you chosen? By God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, I have no idea what you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Hehehe, Hahaha!! I see, I see!! What a thing! It was you, wasn&rsquo;t it? Not Issei Tanaka!! Then!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately afterward, Phu Yen comes at Kai with full power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must kill you and take you back!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without even using Darkness, it&rsquo;s a sheer force.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the most effective for Kai, the difference in magic power is an absolute difference that can&rsquo;t be overcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it! Mirage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai also uses Mirage in an attempt to gain any advantage he could.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s barely effective anymore!! Knight of God!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Easily seen through by Phu Yen.</p>

<p>The only reason he&rsquo;s able to cross swords is because of his experience of life-or-death situations.</p>

<p>Experience of turning the tide in a disadvantageous battle, but still, defeat is slowly approaching.</p>

<p>The difference in magic power is absolute, and Kai&rsquo;s experience is still too immature to cover that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the last hope is.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Artifact? What are you talking about? What kind of power do you say I have!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aya desperately clutches the crimson gem in her hand.</p>

<p>A beautiful crimson magic stone extracted from a monster called a &ldquo;crimson dragon,&rdquo; a top-class A-Rank dragon species.</p>

<p>It was a gift from her grandfather, the chairman of the Japanese Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have such a power; I don&rsquo;t have any special power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The personality of Aya, who lives nobly, was created by effort.</p>

<p>She was raised with expectations from her birth, circumstances, and magic power.</p>

<p>However, she had no power.</p>

<p>She should have a lot of magic power, but she can&rsquo;t do anything, she can&rsquo;t accomplish anything. For this reason, she was sometimes despised as an incompetent S-Rank, but she silenced them with her strenuous efforts.</p>

<p>She studied more than anyone else, she learned more than anyone else.</p>

<p>Yet, she didn&rsquo;t understand what magic power was, and even though she knew she had a vast amount of magic power, she didn&rsquo;t know how to use it.</p>

<p>If she dove into the dungeon, this dark world might change.</p>

<p>She had such faint hope and asked to dive into the dungeon now that she had turned 18.</p>

<p>Aya&rsquo;s life was just ahead of her.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where it seemed to be coming to an end.</p>

<p>At the end, in words she couldn&rsquo;t understand, she was told to do her best because she had special powers.</p>

<p>There was no way she could believe it.</p>

<p>It was a word she had always wanted to believe but had been constantly denied.</p>

<p>The short 18 years, which to her had been a lifetime.</p>

<p>She was not special; Her mundane self-had no value in this world.</p>

<p>The days of being made to think so had taught her to build walls between herself and others, making her seem like a noble young girl at first glance.</p>

<p>That was what lay at the core of her being.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use&#8230; I can&rsquo;t do it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The more she tried, the more powerless she felt, and tears spilled out.</p>

<p>Just as she was about to give up and release her gripped hand in defeat&#8213;</p>

<p>Kai was blown onto the wall beside her.</p>

<p>Blood flowed from his head, but his eyes were still unyielding, straight and shining golden.</p>

<p>Even in tatters, those eyes never lost their light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haha, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve been desperately trying to do, but that girl can&rsquo;t do anything, can she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen laughed and scorned Aya.</p>

<p>His eyes looked down on Aya with a sleazy, base gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she have any value other than her pedigree? Do you need to save such a worthless girl? There&rsquo;s a slight chance you could escape if it&rsquo;s just you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aya looked down, tears falling.</p>

<p>She had heard it many times before; these looks had always been praised.</p>

<p>Only these looks, only this exterior, had always been praised by everyone with superficial words.</p>

<p>It was unbearably frustrating.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy could see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about her possibilities when you can&rsquo;t see anything. Don&rsquo;t deny her possibilities when you can only see the outside. She&rsquo;s strong. She has a truly strong heart that doesn&rsquo;t give up and believes in herself. You can&rsquo;t understand that. You can&rsquo;t understand the feelings of someone who has been called incompetent all their lives. The strength of a heart that never gives up!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai had heard from Tanaka.</p>

<p>That Aya had been called, within half baseless rumors, &ldquo;The Incompetent S-Rank&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And that she had continued to pile up efforts to resist.</p>

<p>That pain, that frustration, and that amazingness.</p>

<p>Kai knew it all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still standing, are you? I don&rsquo;t understand. Is it not you who can&rsquo;t see the situation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai stood up, battered and bruised.</p>

<p>He stood up again and again with his unbreakable spirit, which he was confident in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can see. Everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Kai pointed at Phu Yen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hahaha! What are you saying in this situation? Ah&#8230; I&rsquo;m tired. Let&rsquo;s end this. I&rsquo;ll prove you wrong with this!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately after, Phu Yen ran with all his might and stood in front of Aya, not Kai.</p>

<p>He swung his sword down and aimed it at Aya&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>An undeniable blade of death, its murderous edge attacked Aya.</p>

<p>Aya involuntarily closed her eyes.</p>

<p>Just then, Aya&rsquo;s face was drenched in fresh blood.</p>

<p>The red, iron-tasting blood stained Aya&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that blood was not her own; she opened her eyes and looked up.</p>

<p>It was his back.</p>

<p>Raising his sword, he somehow managed to stop the blow.</p>

<p>However, the blade bit into his left hand and blood spurted out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amachi-san&#8230; why&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look away, Ryuenji-san. Keep believing in yourself, in your power! Not giving up is all people like us have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those words were once said to his past self.</p>

<p>Kai, who had always scorned himself, had changed his world ultimately by his own mindset.</p>

<p>Kai, enduring the pain, turned back and smiled broadly.</p>

<p>He then endured the pain and counterattacked, but Phu Yen kept his distance.</p>

<p>Kai, who had severely damaged his left arm, could no longer grip the sword with both hands, and knelt down.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Aya&#8230;</p>

<p>Nodded slowly.</p>

<p>Once again, without averting her eyes from the heart, she entrusted her wishes straight to the gem in her palm.</p>

<p>She didn&rsquo;t know what she could do.</p>

<p>But for the people who have been desperately protecting her until now, for the people who have believed in her until now&#8230;</p>

<p>She wanted to answer with all her might.</p>

<p>She bit her lip and as if praying put power into her hand.</p>

<p>This time she won&rsquo;t doubt, this time she won&rsquo;t give up.</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s not a loss until death ends everything.</p>

<p>Then, a drop of blood seeped from Aya&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>The fresh blood flowed into the gem she held in her hand,</p>

<p>And the moment a drop of blood touched the crimson magic stone&#8230;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the magic stone shone brightly like the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What is this&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai laughed at the sight, while Phu Yen was surprised but shielded his face from the brightness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believed in you&#8230; I&rsquo;ll borrow this for bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai took the red gem in Aya&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>He gripped the gem tightly and stood up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened, but is this your last struggle? A distraction at this point?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. This is her true power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsense, that woman is incompetent! That&rsquo;s an unchangeable fact!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You just can&rsquo;t see&#8230; about her. And then&#8230; &ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;can&rsquo;t see? What are you talking about&#9472;&#9472;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen widened his eyes.</p>

<p>He frantically looked around.</p>

<p>Because Kai, who should have been visible until a moment ago, had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai suddenly disappeared from his view.</p>

<p>It was Kai&rsquo;s skill that distorted light and showed illusions.</p>

<p>But it was a power that was supposed to have no effect on superior opponents.</p>

<p>That skill distorted Phu Yen&rsquo;s vision, as if.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>In a dark cave, there&rsquo;s a room with a single girl and a fanatic.</p>

<p>However, hidden in the darkness, bathed in light, there&rsquo;s also a boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh-where did he go!? What&rsquo;s happening!? Come out!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen frantically scans the surroundings.</p>

<p>However, he can&rsquo;t discern the figure of Kai, whom he was fighting just a moment ago.</p>

<p>He was visible, was visible until that moment, but then he suddenly vanished from his sight as if he had melted away.</p>

<p>It was an uncannily similar situation to when he himself entraps his targets.</p>

<p>Indeed, Kai has the power to obstruct recognition.</p>

<p>But that power should be ineffective against opponents weaker than himself.</p>

<p>Even though it should be impossible&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible&#8230; It can&rsquo;t be!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen&rsquo;s shouts echo off the cold walls.</p>

<p>Something glowing, created by that supposedly incompetent girl.</p>

<p>Did she perhaps create a special piece of equipment?</p>

<p>Something even surpassing his own magic power?</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-stop it!! Stop it!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen swings his sword blindly.</p>

<p>He had never realized that not being able to see could inspire such terror.</p>

<p>His entire body, his eyes, his back, his legs, all tremble in the fear of not knowing when he will be struck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out! Where are you!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The composed Phu Yen from just a moment ago is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>In his terror of not knowing when he will be struck, he swings his sword.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s no way he can hit anything with just that.</p>

<p>And then&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai isn&rsquo;t lenient enough to overlook that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gahh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right after that, Kai appears beneath the flank of Phu Yen, who had swung his sword recklessly. In front of Phu Yen&rsquo;s eyes, he thrusts a pure white sword into his chest.</p>

<p>Piercing through his heart, breaking through the flesh without any chance for defense, Phu Yen collapses weakly, blood spilling from his mouth.</p>

<p>Kai doesn&rsquo;t hesitate at all.</p>

<p>It was Kai&rsquo;s first time killing, but if he hadn&rsquo;t killed, he would&rsquo;ve been killed.</p>

<p>It was a life-or-death struggle, and a single misstep could have meant his own death.</p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, he can&rsquo;t afford to hesitate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you; you&rsquo;ll lose&#8230; Well, thanks to her power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&#8230; Why is this&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai pulls out his sword, wiping off the blood.</p>

<p>Phu Yen weakly kneels, then collapses to the ground from his back, dropping his sword.</p>

<p>Blood spews from his mouth, and his eyes stare blankly at the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai merely looks down at him from above.</p>

<p>He watches the dying figure desperately trying to draw in oxygen.</p>

<p>He listens to the sound of struggling breaths.</p>

<p>By now, Phu Yen&rsquo;s life is merely a candle in the wind, Kai holds the solid sensation of having killed.</p>

<p>Slowly but surely, the sensation of having killed someone for the first time circulates through Kai&rsquo;s body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&#8230; What is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen, on the verge of death, opens his mouth.</p>

<p>Coughing up blood, he desperately strings together words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her power. Creating an artifact. I surpassed you with that power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(To be precise, only with intelligence)</p>

<p>The reason for Kai&rsquo;s victory is the artifact created by Aya.</p>

<p>That power only amplified the reflection rate of Kai&rsquo;s intelligence and enhanced the effect of the mirage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Creating an artifact&#8230; how did you know that woman had such power?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you; I can see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen looks into Kai&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>And then he realizes, the golden glow in the depths of those eyes, blazing like fire.</p>

<p>With an expression of surprise, his eyes widen, and he looks at Kai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, so that&rsquo;s what it is. Divine favor&#8230; that&rsquo;s what kind of power it is. I wanted to report this to him&#8230; what a dangerous power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, I gained this power. Tell me too, what is that God? Why do you hate God? What is your purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why hate&#8230; We must annihilate God. That is his lifelong wish. A method to destroy the existing world. And I&#8230; I must eliminate the Cubes created by the God who whimsically took away the one I loved. That&rsquo;s my reason to live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai grimaces at his words and the expression on Phu Yen&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>He thought he was just evil, but it seemed Phu Yen had his own justice.</p>

<p>And then Kai realizes.</p>

<p>The face of Phu Yen, who had a demonic expression just a moment ago, now looked gentle and devout, like a priest.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a mistake or an illusion, his face was truly at peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh, you&rsquo;re still naive, showing such a face to a dying enemy&#8230; it&rsquo;s fine, I&rsquo;ve been released from the control of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kai lifts the collapsing Phu Yen, for some reason feeling like he&rsquo;s about to shed tears.</p>

<p>Just a while ago, he couldn&rsquo;t comprehend Phu Yen&rsquo;s words, but now, Phu Yen&rsquo;s expression was incredibly peaceful.</p>

<p>Checking the status, what was once a state of fanaticism has disappeared and is now replaced by the word &lsquo;dead&rsquo;.</p>

<p>It seemed that Phu Yen was being controlled somehow.</p>

<p>Yet, from the words that followed, Kai realized that even though Phu Yen was controlled, his sense of justice remained the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only that person can save the world. I hope that one day, you, a Knight of God, will realize&#8230; Amachi-san. It&rsquo;s informal, but I hope your future belongs only to you, and also&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phu Yen clutches the cross necklace hanging from his neck upside down.</p>

<p>He makes the sign of the cross towards Kai.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I wish for a future where mankind alone owns its destiny&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a gesture associated with devil worship known as the inverted cross.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this gesture was as devout as a priests&rsquo;, and the face that had been so twisted until now was extremely peaceful.</p>

<p>And then, Phu Yen slowly closed his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, there are still things I want to ask you! Hey! Hey&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no response, and Phu Yen drew his final breath just like that.</p>

<p>&#9671;Kai&rsquo;s perspective</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was all that&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mutter weakly.</p>

<p>This sense of victory is too bitter, too unpleasant.</p>

<p>The guilt of having killed a person and the peaceful face of the man who should&rsquo;ve been the worst are seared into my mind.</p>

<p>Maybe he was actually a good person.</p>

<p>After he killed so many, nearly getting killed by him, and yet, that dead man&rsquo;s face was kind enough to make me think that.</p>

<p>I shake my head, trying to forget.</p>

<p>Until the end, I didn&rsquo;t fully understand what this being who called himself Phu Yen was saying.</p>

<p>But for now, I have to deal with this situation.</p>

<p>I stare at the crimson jewel in my hand.</p>

<p>Type: Item (Artifact)</p>

<p>Title: The Crimson Dragon&rsquo;s Intellect</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: S</p>

<p>Effect&#65306;+25% Intelligence Reflection Rate</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>An item using a crimson dragon&rsquo;s magic stone and transformed into an artifact.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, due to being an unfinished item, it is unstable.</p>

<p>Time Until Breakdown: 00:00:03</p>

<p>Three seconds later, the jewel cracks with a click.</p>

<p>Apparently, there&rsquo;s a time limit.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to speculate, but there&rsquo;s no time for that now, because I&rsquo;m about to lose consciousness.</p>

<p>I put the item in my pocket and headed towards Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s a lot we need to discuss, but let&rsquo;s get outside first. I&rsquo;m about to lose consciousness. I&rsquo;ll take down the boss in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m clutching my left arm. The gash on my shoulder is slowly changing color as it bleeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My&#8230; my leg&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I look at Ryuenji-san&rsquo;s leg.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s on her knees, her trembling legs unable to support her enough to stand up.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have the energy to wait until she can stand.</p>

<p>I kneel down in front of Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please hold on to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My left arm won&rsquo;t move because of the wound Phu Yen inflicted. Can you hold on to me, Ryuenji-san? I think I can carry you with just my right hand. Can your arm move?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh!? Well, it can move, but&#8230; Eh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san&rsquo;s face is turning red as she panics.</p>

<p>However, we can&rsquo;t afford to be talking about that now.</p>

<p>If I lose consciousness, she alone won&rsquo;t be able to conquer the dungeon.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I urge Ryuenji-san to press against me.</p>

<p>I unintentionally become stern due to the lack of time.</p>

<p>Because losing consciousness here would be equivalent to causing Ryuenji-san&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>This is a C-Rank dungeon, not a place where ordinary people can survive.</p>

<p>So,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san, groaning, seemed to give up and clung to me.</p>

<p>Then, I lift her up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Hold on tighter. You&rsquo;re about to fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Umm&#8230; okay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I feel a bit guilty, but I can&rsquo;t afford to think about that now.</p>

<p>I put away my sword, lift Ryuenji-san up with my right hand and hold her butt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eek!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please bear with it. Anyway&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!!??&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Also, her silky hair smells good&#8230;)</p>

<p>As a healthy man, it can&rsquo;t be helped that I would take a sniff.</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san, her face and ears turning red, curls up on my chest.</p>

<p>Although she&rsquo;s groaning, I stand up without paying any mind.</p>

<p>I ran towards the boss room with her in my arms, open the door, and put her down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;BUUUMOOOOO!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have time for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;BUUUMOOO!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I kill the boss in five seconds.</p>

<p>In front of my magic power and Mirage, the C-Rank boss couldn&rsquo;t even recognize what was happening before it died.</p>

<p>I kneel down on the spot, then lie down and close my eyes.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was at my limit, losing too much blood.</p>

<p>I somehow endured by sheer willpower, but I was so anemic I felt like throwing up, and my shoulder was already numb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haha, why does this always happen to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amachi-san!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hear Miss Ryuuzenji calling out to me, but we&rsquo;re wrapped in particles of light and transported outside.</p>

<p>I lose consciousness as if falling asleep.</p>

<p>The victor of the fierce battle was Kai.</p>

<p>The one defeated was Phu Yen Wen, the bishop of the God-Destruction cult, an enemy of the world.</p>

<p>But this victory was merely the beginning of a great disaster that would soon strike Japan.</p>

<p>But for now, all Kai does is sleep.</p>

<p>As always, after surviving a deadly battle.</p>

<p>Afterword</p>

<p>With that said, for now, we&rsquo;ll stop here. I&rsquo;m thinking of catching up to the most recent episodes by publishing two per day. I apologize for the wait.</p>

<p>As of now, I&rsquo;ve finished revising about 70 chapters, which seems like a good pace.</p>

<p>First, I apologize for the many revisions.</p>

<p>Although this is a free web novel, I have reflected on my greatly insincere attitude towards the readers. As the author, I chose to revise with the intention of finishing it somehow for the people who have been supporting me, rather than ending the web version and only going for publication.</p>

<p>Even so, it can&rsquo;t be helped if some readers drift away.</p>

<p>Unless I fall ill, I intend to continue publishing until the conclusion, so I hope for your continued support.</p>

<p>See you again in the Temple of Eternity arc!</p>

<p>&#8251;Basically, the battle scenes have changed significantly.</p>

<p>Apart from the battle scenes, the basic flow hasn&rsquo;t changed, so please feel free to skip or re-read anything you notice has changed and enjoy.</p>
