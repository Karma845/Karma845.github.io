<h3>Chapter 9</h3>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s why they won’t be bothering Rika anymore” (Susami)</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day at lunchtime, Kyoya took me to the courtyard where Susami and Chitose were sitting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she saw me, she gave me an annoyed grin and said: “Thank you”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I tilted my head wondering what was that for, Susami begins to tell me about what happened after the incident with Tachibana and the girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re awfully good at what you do, huh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, it’s for the sake of cute Rika”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to what she said, as soon as she was told what happened by Tachibana, she identified the girls and went to talk to them directly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from that, she nailed them and told them to stop without any ingenuity and trickery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all it took them to stop troubling Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on top of all that, she also went and contacted Ichinose and had a chat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I was only trying to protect her, the one who healed her wounds is you, Kusuba-kun” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?” (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is so” (Susami)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Susami gave a sly chuckle.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not sure if that’s the right word to use but I can’t think of anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL- That’s the MC commenting…. not me….)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhhh, Ren. Isn’t it finally going to the point where you can’t hide It anymore? (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hide what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoya, who was now very excited, put his arm around my shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was getting a bit tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t play dumb, you’re in love with Tachibana-san, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s not…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, what was that weird pause?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…shut up”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoya suddenly brings up romance like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be natural for high school student, but it was still too much for me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL-Aint ya a high school student too?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, don’t say stuff like that in front of susami…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohhhh…why not?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t. I’m not Hinata.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The laugh, which is unique to Susami as if she can see right through me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m afraid of this laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s as if she knows everything about me, what I’m hiding and what I’m not aware of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the contrary actually, I think that Rika and Kisusba-kun are a good match” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me too! They both have their own slow pace, but their pace is the same!” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think there’s enough reason for us to be in a relationship. We can still be friends.” (Kusuba)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL- Well…shit. And imma stop commenting mid-chap, or I’ll vent. Lmao)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s getting up to me good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you don’t know what Rika thinks about it do you? (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">He is not stopping.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Usually, I can just talk him out of it. But today I’m dealing with more than just him.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">And that being Susami? It was just way more troublesome.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can change it, or you can’t. You can choose what to do based on what happens. (Susami)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL- I am so lost…)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I want Rika and you to go out” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their teamwork is quite vicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, It was surprising that Susami was so positive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she would want to protect Tachibana like Hinata.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to protect her too, of course”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She just laughed when I told her about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you see? I want to protect her, so I want her to be with you. She’s a little more vulnerable than you think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we go out, we’ll go on a double date, that’s a promise!” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I an outcast?” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A triple date is fine as well, but Susami, do you have a boyfriend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we’ll see”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Susami smiles her usual smile as if it’s completely normal for her to be his way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not? We’re are saying if you two go out” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, It’s an “if”” (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…Enough with that” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my back to them and decided to quickly leave the courtyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Susami said “See you later” and left easily but Kyoya, as expected, followed me and put his arms around my shoulders again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But well, I guess there’s not much point denying it now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are changing, bit by bit. It’s also for the better. So don’t go lying to yourself about your feelings, alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t talk normally to Kyoya who suddenly changed to such a formal tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been secretly closing the distance to the line I didn’t want him to cross over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was seen easily and he came to the shortest distance possible</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess this is one of his good points but a weakness of mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you know what’s going on, then it’s alright. If you don’t like Tachibana, you can continue things as they are. But if you do, then you can always rely on me alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…even if you tell me that, you’re the only one I have, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, That’s right”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, deny it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t lie to my best friend, I’m too honest”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah well, he is a good guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…well, I’m sure he doesn’t lie.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was raining heavily that day</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the umbrella was so useless that I was soaking wet on my way home to school, thus I took a shower as soon as I reached my apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterwards, I ate dinner and relaxed a bit, as usual, listening to the sound of the rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As night came by, the thunder began to rumble loudly and the view of my city from my window was now dark and gloomy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On a night like this, the only thing to do is buy a manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time I finished reading the first volume of the manga I had bought on my phone, I was completely hooked on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I’m an ebook type of person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">BOOM!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was pondering about this, the violent thunder boomed as the ground rumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was 100% sure that the lightning reached the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed to be considerably close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being able to stay at home in such a downpour makes me feel like I’m getting something out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I thought to myself as I flipped the pages of the manga on my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she hasn’t come means she’s alright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tachibana is a very diligent person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, she wouldn’t be here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had a bad feeling, that’s why…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I didn’t have Tachibana’s number</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have Susami’s contacts though, which I was somehow forced to give her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought it would come in handy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The weather had shown a 90% chance for precipitation so it was unlikely that Tachibana would be alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is there any chance that she is with Hinata?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I don’t think so, Tachibana went straight home. And it doesn’t sound like Hinata is here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was too quiet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is thunder, but no screaming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you in front of her room”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes, I’m here on business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing that came to my mind was an excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll explain to her what happened and apologize with you later. So please, Kusuba-kun”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tachibana! What’s wrong?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s just my hypothesis but it’s no time to be worrying about that right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her breathing was rough even though she was unconscious and her expression was tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slowly walked into a room and put Tachibana on a bed and avoided looking into the room as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though her body was quite hot, I should probably put a cover on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alright now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…Thank you very much…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tachibana slowly opened her eyes a bit and looked up at me. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes looked vacant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, it’s ok. Just tell me beforehand if you’re not feeling well. I could’ve done something more to help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tachibana was silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably asleep now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you should ask. You have a friend nearby. I don’t care how crappy he is; he is still better than nothing. I know how you feel so don’t worry about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I’m glad you were able to sleep through my boring story.</span></p

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I was also doing something I wasn’t used to.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goodnight Tachibana”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I said that to her, I closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I surrendered myself to the incoming wave to slumber.</span></p>

<p>¬Tachibana’s health had gotten much better the next day.</p>
<p>It was still hard for her to get up but she seemed more conscious than yesterday.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>“…38.6 degrees”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s better than before”</p>
<p>I took the thermometer from Tachibana and put it in the case.</p>
<p>It’s almost noon, I should go to the store.</p>

<p>“Ah, also, I’m going shopping right now. Is there anything you want?</p>
<p>“…Water and something to eat. Along with some medicine”</p>
<p>“All right, I’ll get it. You don’t mind if I leave you alone for a while, do you?”</p>
<p>Tachibana nodded slowly.</p>
<p>I got ready and headed for the door.</p>
<p>Just before I could leave, Tachibana called out to me in a small voice.</p>
<p>“Kusuba-san”</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>
<p>“Thanks…a lot…”</p>
<p>“No problem, see you in a while”</p>
<p>When I came back from shopping, Susami had already arrived and was in Tachibana’s room”</p>
<p>“Welcome back Kusuba-kun. Thanks for your hard work.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry for bothering you”</p>
<p>“It’s for Rika’s sake and besides, I don’t have any club activities today.”</p>
<p>Susami was smartly dressed in a dark green top and jeans.</p>
<p>She looked even more mature than she did in her school uniform, looking calm and composed which was unlike her age.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Where’s Tachibana?” (Kusuba)</p>
<p>“She’s sleeping right now. She doesn’t look so bad so she should already be getting better.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s good. Did you talk to Tachibana?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a bit”</p>
<p>While taking to Susami, I put the drinks, jelly and fruits I brought into the refrigerator.</p>
<p>I gave the cold medicine to Susami.</p>
<p>“I’ll give the medicine to you, take care of the rest. With you here, Tachibana will be at ease.”</p>
<p>“Yes, leave it to me”</p>
<p>“My apartment is just on the other side. Call me if you need something”</p>
<p>After saying that, I took my stuff and headed out.</p>
<p>Susami is a very reliable person, I’m sure everything will be fine.</p>
<p>“Kusuba-kun”</p>
<p>I turned around as I put on my shoes.</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Since we are already here, let’s have a little talk.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“Talk about what?”</p>
<p>“Just some small talk, I’ll get bored if I’m alone. Unless you’re busy of course.”</p>
<p>I thought about it and gave a small nod.</p>
<p>I owe Susami a debt of gratitude for coming.</p>
<p>And it’s not like I have anything else to do.</p>
<p>Thank you. Rika is sleeping, so we’ll speak in whispers, ok?”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>Susami smiled at me.</p>
<p>I can’t find any flaws in her.</p>
<p>The fact that I can’t find any flaws in her is one of the scariest things about her.</p>
<p>Beside the bed where Tachibana was sleeping, Susami and I sat across each other at the table.</p>
<p>It was not that we were facing each other, but rather of keeping an appropriate distance as a man and woman.</p>
<p>“Thank you for helping Rika yesterday.”</p>
<p>“I was trespassing though…”<br />
(TL- Don’t just admit it…)</p>
<p>“I did give you permission. I won’t allow anyone to complain.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“You scared me really bad that time. She was literally just lying there, you know?”</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t been there, it could have gotten way worse.”</p>
<p>“You scaring me”</p>
<p>“But it’s true”<br />
Susami chuckled.</p>
<p>“By the way…”</p>
<p>Susami stood up quickly and looked at Tachibana.</p>
<p>“Have you ever been in love?”</p>
<p><em>She was probably checking if Tachibana was awake.</em></p>
<p>That line which I was pondering came out of Susami’s mouth.</p>
<p>As usual, she has a way of picking out topics people don’t like.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.5</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“…That too sudden.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that you didn’t have many friends, so I was curious about that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are curious about that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu, have you ever?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have any experience with it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve never fallen in love?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No…well…maybe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you are experienced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not like I’ve ever confessed to someone, gotten confessed, or gone out with someone. I have never done anything like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, It’s not like that.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Susami laid her face on the table and bought her face closer to me</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: Actually- </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Put her face on the table</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. I have a picture under the chapter for reference)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at me with a gaze that seemed to glue a person at the spot, but without any hostility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Merely knowing what it’s like to love someone is a lot different than not knowing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is. Especially for you right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as she said that, I knew what this was going to be about now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that topic was even more unpleasant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And especially for me right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure you were there when Ichinose confessed to Rika.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a question for you Kusuba-kun, why do you think Rika rejected him?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I don’t like you”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s what Tachibana had said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a simple reason. Nothing more, nothing less.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the fact that it was simple, shows that various implications could be assumed in this line.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s also why I wondered why Ichinose backed down at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may seem like saying ‘you don’t like the other person&#8217; is the correct way to refuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But actually, that’s not a reason to refuse a relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if she didn’t like Ichinose, it’s not a good enough reason </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">to go out with him. The idea that you won’t go out with someone you don’t like doesn’t exist in the first place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Susami is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People are often happy when they are asked to be in a relationship, even if they don’t like the other person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if you don’t know the person well, it just gets more exciting that way. And if the other person is good-looking, you will expect to like him or her even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Reminds me of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Making lovers</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, lmao.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are times that the confession </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> the trigger for falling in love with someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Ichinose is a good person as far as I can see. Which girl wouldn’t be happy to receive a confession from him?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know why Tachibana rejected Ichinose, who is handsome and has a good reputation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I must have been so concerned that I stopped suddenly</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to close the door, I saw that Susami had a mysteriously calm smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a financial hit from buying the manga in bulk yesterday, I was reading a novel I bought at a second-hand bookstore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, the fact I was able to kill 8 hours with three 300-yen books is quite an accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second-handed books may be a better way to pass time using less money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I wonder what happened to Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> I was just pretending not to know anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> I just pretended not to notice anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> No, that was all I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> That was the limit of me, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">a fool.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t digest such complex thoughts by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah..shit…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sent a message on my smartphone without realizing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m really annoyed because it seems like she was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> The message was immediately marked as read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> And I don’t know why but that pissed me off too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Leave it to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Leave what to you??</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ask me first, you idiot.</span></p>
