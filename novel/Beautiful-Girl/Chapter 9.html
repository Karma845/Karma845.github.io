<h2>Chapter 9: Lunch Box</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p> <br />After a two-day break, school had resumed.<br /> <br />However, since Monday and Tuesday were days off, Saito only had to go to school for three days in a week.<br /> <br />He felt a strange discomfort carrying a backpack stuffed with gym clothes, something he wouldn’t usually have after a break.<br /> <br />Actually, there was something else, and today his childhood friend, Lily, had one more thing with her.<br /> <br />One might think it’s natural since she brought a gym uniform, but it’s not.<br /> <br />In addition to the bag containing the gym uniform, she was holding another small mysterious tote.<br /> <br />Considering that there were no special classes today after the school trip, and there shouldn’t be a need to bring anything extra, it was strange.<br /> <br />He thought maybe he had forgotten something, but that wasn’t the case.<br /> <br />Earlier, he asked his friends Kai and Haruki if there was anything special to bring today, and they both said there wasn’t.<br /> <br />In other words, why Lily brought the tote bag was a complete mystery.<br /> <br />It was intriguing.<br /> <br />Unable to resist the urge to find out, Saito walked over to Lily’s side.<br /> <br />“Hey, what’s in that tote?”<br /> <br />He quietly whispered to Lily.<br /> <br />“Uh!”<br /> <br />She let out a strange sound and covered her ears, creating some distance.<br /> <br />(Is it really that surprising?)<br /> <br />Saito was amazed at her hypersensitive reaction, considering that whispering on a train should be normal.<br /> <br />“So, what’s in that bag?”<br /> <br />“Bento.”<br /> <br />This time, she answered succinctly with three words when he asked directly, attempting not to surprise her.<br /> <br />(Oh, it’s a lunchbox. Is it a lunchbox cooler bag?)<br /> <br />With this revelation, Saito’s doubts disappeared.<br /> <br />It seemed that the bag she was carrying was indeed a cooler bag to protect the lunchbox from the heat.<br /> <br />Certainly, the weather had been getting warmer lately compared to the time of the entrance ceremony.<br /> <br />Some food items might spoil faster because of it.<br /> <br />It seemed like a precautionary measure.<br /> <br />Satisfied with the simple explanation, Saito, being the simple person he was, casually agreed to bring a cooler bag along with his lunchbox starting from tomorrow.<br /> <br />Even though Lily’s bag could fit inside a regular school bag, she chose to carry it in her hand. The reason for this became clear upon closer consideration.<br /> <br />Unaware of the meaning behind it, Saito continued his usual routine, swaying in the train, waiting to reach the station.<br /> </p>



<p> </p>





<p><br />“Hey, I heard there’s a commotion going on over there.”<br /> <br />“Moreover, the two top angels of our school are causing a scene, fighting over a mediocre-looking guy.”<br /> <br />“For real!? Sounds damn interesting. Let’s go check it out.”<br /> <br />“What’s with all the noise?”<br /> <br />“Wonder what it is?”<br /> <br />Upon arriving at school, both Lily and I tilted our heads in unison, curious about what was happening.<br /> <br />After putting our shoes in the locker and changing into indoor shoes, we headed towards our classroom. As we approached, the number of people increased.<br /> <br />By the time we reached the classroom, the front was overflowing with people, and something significant was obviously happening.<br /> <br />“What’s going on, Saito?” surprised, while Saito is expressing confusion, Lily, in her second go at life, grimaces as she finally understands the cause.<br /> <br />Pushing through the crowd and finally reaching the classroom door, Saito realizes what the spectators were focusing on.<br /> <br />“Haruki had a promise to have lunch with Mizuki today! He’s going home!”<br /> <br />“Bu-but we confirmed yesterday when I invited him. That’s why you’re the one who should back off!”<br /> <br />“Ouch, it hurts! You two, if you keep fighting, my arms will come off!”<br /> <br />In the midst of the crowd, two beautiful girls, similar to Lily’s level, were sparking and creating fireworks, fighting over a somewhat plain-looking guy.<br /> <br />It was a scene straight out of a chaotic battlefield.<br /> <br />It made sense that gossip-loving high school students would gather to witness this spectacle.<br /> <br />“Ah, Saito-kun! Help me, please!”<br /> <br />Analyzing the situation calmly, I made eye contact with my friend in the middle of the turmoil. He pleaded for my help.<br /> <br />“Sorry, looks like I can’t do much. Good luck, Mr. Popular.”<br /> <br />If a friend asks for help, I wouldn’t usually hesitate, but when threatened by the two intense gazes, I couldn’t interfere.<br /> <br />“You heartless guy!”<br /> <br />Feeling apologetic, I looked away, entering the classroom. From behind, I could still hear my friend’s desperate cries being ignored.<br /> <br />It was the fate of someone liked by beautiful girls – a situation I had no control over.<br /> <br />“NAMU “<br /> <br />Nemu.”<br /> <br />Saying a brief prayer for him, I entered the classroom and joined my friend Kai, who seemed to be observing the chaos.<br /> <br />“So, what the hell happened there?”<br /> <br />Putting jokes aside, I asked Kai, hoping to get reliable information since the gossipers outside weren’t trustworthy.<br /> <br />“Let me explain. It dates back thousands of years—”<br /> <br />“Too far back. Give me a short version.”<br /> <br />“—Haruki made a promise to have lunch with his childhood friend, whom he always eats with. But today, he made another promise to have lunch with another girl. That’s it.”<br /> <br />I see. It’s Haruki’s fault for not contacting first.<br /> <br />” Guilty.”<br /> <br />It felt like kai were about to delve into the origins of humanity, so Saito fast-forwarded through the conversation by tapping the head of Kai.<br /> <br />When he released it at an appropriate point, he succinctly explained what had happened.<br /> <br />Upon hearing that, Saito’s verdict was guilty.<br /> <br />Since Haruki’s mistake led to a double booking, it was Haruki’s fault for not communicating.<br /> <br />It was only natural for chaos to ensue.<br /> <br />(But, there really are guys like harem protagonists in real life.)<br /> <br />Saito thought about it while putting his belongings in his bag.<br /> <br />Honestly, until he witnessed that scene, he didn’t believe there were typical harem protagonists in real life.<br /> <br />Being surrounded by multiple girls seemed reserved for flashy types or handsome actors on TV.<br /> <br />That was Saito’s perception, but watching his friend Haruki changed his perspective.<br /> <br />Haruki had a baby face with a cute appearance, but compared to actors on TV, he was two or three steps below in terms of looks. He didn’t have a flashy appearance, except for slightly long bangs, and he dressed in a conventional way.<br /> <br />Saito learned that even with average looks, one could be praised by beautiful girls.<br /> <br />Of course, it wasn’t applicable to everyone, and the caveat was having a caring personality like Haruki, who couldn’t ignore someone in trouble in any situation.<br /> <br />(I can’t do that.)<br /> <br />Saito had the desire to be popular like everyone else.<br /> <br />However, when it came to dealing with multiple people, he knew it was a definite NO.<br /> <br />Juggling the moods of several people was something Saito couldn’t handle.<br /> <br />Even with just one girl, he occasionally stepped on a landmine and triggered a lightning strike.<br /> <br />If he dealt with multiple people, lightning would strike all over him, leaving him completely burnt to a crisp.<br /> <br />Imagining himself disappearing into ashes, Saito shivered, and just then, the chime rang.<br /> <br />“Alright, everyone, it’s time for the SHR break! Please return to the classroom!”<br /> <br />Though onlookers seemed reluctant to leave, still fascinated by the chaotic scene, a stern command from the unexpectedly wise teacher scattered them, and they returned to their own classroom like scattering spiderlings.<br /> <br />(Impressive.)<br /> <br />Saito looked at the wise teacher with respect, and just as he did, Haruki and Mizuki, the protagonists of the commotion, returned to the classroom.<br /> <br />(Impressive, he still has all his limbs.)<br /> <br />Saito directed a gaze of admiration not only at the homeroom teacher but also at his friend, who had returned safely with all his limbs intact.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After that, during each break, a senior named Shirayuri Koyuki, who belonged to the student council, would come and, apart from the battle over Haruki, everything progressed calmly. Finally, the anticipated lunch break arrived.<br /> <br />Why was it a problem, you ask? Because Haruki hadn’t yet decided whether to have lunch with Mizuki or Koyuki, despite discussing it every break.<br /> <br />Despite their ongoing discussions, their stubbornness had prevented them from finding a satisfactory compromise.<br /> <br />At first, it was amusing to see his friend flustered.<br /> <br />However, if it was repeated many times, the frustration towards his friend for not making a decision sooner surpassed the amusement.<br /> <br />“It’s Mizuki!”<br /> <br />“It’s me!”<br /> <br />“Ugh, I’m fed up with this. Let’s decide with rock-paper-scissors!”<br /> <br />Unable to speak due to the pressure from both sides, Saito, reaching his limit, intervened between the two.<br /> <br />“don’t get in the way, Saito.”<br /> <br />“That’s right. Outsiders should back off.”<br /> <br />“I’m not an outsider! I’m tired of your noisy commotion here. Seriously, make a decision, you two!”<br /> <br />“…Senior won’t back down.”<br /> <br />“…Mizuki-san won’t back down either.”<br /> <br />Even though he was glared at fiercely by the two beautiful girls, Saito, at his wit’s end, stood his ground.<br /> <br />When Saito lectured them, the two seemed to feel guilty for prolonging the situation and awkwardly averted their eyes, still claiming the other was at fault.<br /> <br />“If I win, Haruki will have lunch with me. Rock-paper-scissors, pon!”<br /> <br />Thinking it might take too long, Saito forcefully initiated the rock-paper-scissors game.<br /> <br />Mizuki and Koyuki hurriedly reacted and made their moves.<br /> <br />Saito chose paper.<br /> <br />Mizuki chose scissors.<br /> <br />Koyuki chose rock. The result was Mizuki’s victory.<br /> <br />“I did it!”<br /> <br />“Aww…”<br /> <br />Mizuki raised her scissors high in the air, celebrating her victory, while Koyuki broke down in tears, looking at her tightly clenched fist.<br /> <br />“Alright, so today Mizuki will have lunch with Haruki. I don’t know about tomorrow. Haruki, sort it out yourself.”<br /> <br />“Ah, yeah. Thanks, Saito-kun.”<br /> <br />“See you. Now I can finally eat lunch—Wait, where’s my bento?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>With the winners and losers determined, Saito smoothly wrapped up the situation and returned to his seat. However, he couldn’t find the lunchbox he had brought.<br /> <br />“Let’s eat together today, Saito.”<br /> <br />“Sure, but wait a moment. My lunch is…”<br /> <br />As he looked around, searching for it, Lily approached, inviting him to eat lunch together.<br /> <br />It was unusual, considering that Lily had been eating with Shuri and Minaka recently.<br /> <br />It’s a rare opportunity.<br /> <br />“As much as I’d love to eat together, I can’t seem to find my bento.”<br /> <br />“Well, I have it with me, so no worries. Let’s go to the rooftop already?”<br /> <br />“Oh, really? Don’t surprise me like that. I thought I’d skipped lunch today.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, I wanted to see you in a hurry. Were you anxious?”<br /> <br />“I was freaking out, you idiot.”<br /> <br />Panicking about not having a bento, Saito breathed a sigh of relief when Lily mentioned having one.<br /> <br />It seemed she deliberately hid it to tease him.<br /> <br />While complaining about her mischievous antics, the two headed to the rooftop.<br /> <br />Despite being a popular space for students during lunch, it was surprisingly empty today.<br /> <br />Probably because everyone was gathered in the classrooms, curious about the showdown between Mizuki and Koyuki.<br /> <br />Saito and Lily sat in a shaded area that is usually not available.<br /> <br />“Here, this is for you, Saito.”<br /> <br />“Huh, this? Isn’t this not my bento? What’s going on?”<br /> <br />Today, with the lunch break being noisy, Saito’s stomach, fueled by strange calories, was growling.<br /> <br />As he opened the bento he received from Lily, he froze.<br /> <br />The contents were different from what he expected.<br /> <br />It was supposed to be leftover vegetable stir-fry and imitation crab meat from yesterday morning.<br /> <br />However, the bento in his hands contained rolled omelet and hamburg steak. There were also coleslaw, octopus-shaped sausages, and apples, making it vividly colorful.<br /> <br />This wasn’t Saito’s bento.<br /> <br />“Haha, Saito, you really react well. It’s worth surprising you.”<br /> <br />Confused, Saito looked at Lily, who couldn’t help but burst into laughter.<br /> <br />After a good laugh, she began explaining the story behind preparing the bento.<br /> <br />“Yesterday, we started talking about cooking with Shuri-chan and Minaka-chan. When they heard I was good at cooking, they insisted on trying my food. But, I haven’t cooked much lately, so I wasn’t confident. That’s when I remembered. I remembered that there’s a convenient guinea pig… person who can taste my cooking.”<br /> <br />“Hey, Lily. You can rephrase that, it sounds terrible either way.”<br /> <br />In summary, Lily wanted Saito, her childhood friend, to taste her cooking because she was worried about serving it to her friends.<br /> <br />Despite the ominous mention of a guinea pig, Saito knew there probably wouldn’t be anything weird in it if she intended to share it with friends.<br /> <br />Even though he understood that, dealing with this childhood friend of his, he couldn’t be sure what she might have done.<br /> <br />Gulp.<br /> <br />Unconsciously, Saito made a swallowing sound, and with determination, he took a bite of his favorite hamburg steak.<br /> <br />“…Delicious.”<br /> <br />The hamburg steak was, by all accounts, delicious.<br /> <br />The feedback after trying it was simple – it was just delicious. There were no extravagant or bizarre ingredients, just a well-prepared hamburg steak with a hint of the meat’s sweetness.<br /> <br />If he had to rate it, it would be a perfect five out of five.<br /> <br />The best of the best, Excellent execution.<br /> <br />Expressing his genuine thoughts, Saito made Lily’s face light up with joy.<br /> <br />(What? Why is she smiling like that?)<br /> <br />However, to Saito at that moment, she seemed happy but also somewhat ambiguous.<br /> <br />Despite knowing she was genuinely pleased, there was something more to it.<br /> <br />Feeling uneasy about what might be hidden, Saito cautiously continued eating the bento.<br /> <br />The coleslaw had a pleasant acidity, and the rolled omelet, prepared in the style Saito liked, felt like eating homemade tamagoyaki. The octopus-shaped sausages and apples were cut into bite-sized pieces, showing Lily’s thoughtfulness in different areas.<br /> <br />“…Thanks for the meal. It was really delicious. You can even share this with Yakumo and the others.”<br /> <br />“Yes, you’re welcome. I was a bit worried you might say it doesn’t taste good.”<br /> <br />As an overall review, it was extremely delicious – a perfect ten out of ten.<br /> <br />Satisfied with the meal, Saito assured Lily that it could be shared with their friends. Lily breathed a sigh of relief and happily smiled.<br /> </p>






<p><br />(Hmm?)<br /> <br />At that moment, Saito felt a sudden discomfort behind him.<br /> <br />He instinctively turned around, but there was no one there.<br /> <br />Saito shook his head, thinking it might be his imagination.<br /> <br />“Why did you suddenly turn around like that?”<br /> <br />“Oh, I felt like someone was watching us. Well, maybe it was just my imagination.”<br /> <br />“Could it be Akashi-kun?”<br /> <br />Perhaps it seemed unnatural to Lily when Saito suddenly turned around without any warning and she asked him what’s wrong.<br /> <br />Without any intention to deceive, Saito honestly admitted that he felt like someone was watching him. Without hesitation, he immediately mentioned the name of his friend, who had recently messed up.<br /> <br />“No, that guy should be in the photography club room today, called by the club president.”<br /> <br />However, he quickly denied that.<br /> <br />While Kai can be unpredictable and occasionally lose track of where he is, today his whereabouts are clear.<br /> <br />It seems today is the day for developing photos, and Kai was complaining about being summoned by the club president, so there’s no doubt about it.<br /> <br />“Well, then, a ghost?”<br /> <br />“Maybe.”<br /> <br />“Well, if that’s the case, it would become a mysterious existence like ghosts, but in reality, there’s no way such things exist.<br /> <br />Saito and Lily exchanged glances and smiled.<br /> <br />“Hey, by the way, what happened to the bento I brought? “<br /> <br />“I have it right here. I was planning to bring it out once Saito finished eating.”<br /> <br />“I see. Alright, hand it over. Honestly, eating just one bento is never enough for me. If I eat that, today might actually be satisfying for once.”<br /> <br />“I made quite a bit, considering Saito’s usual portion. Here you go. Well, it’s true that a single bento might be a bit insufficient for someone like Saito.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, yeah, I asked to make it bigger. I don’t have a large bento box at home, so I reluctantly buy bread or nikuman from the convenience store on the way back to fill my stomach.”<br /> <br />The conversation shifted from the topic of someone watching them to the discussion of bentos.<br /> <br />When Saito asked Lily to return the bento hidden by her, he was delighted to finally have a satisfying meal after a long time, while Lily was a bit hesitant, wondering if there was still room in his stomach.<br /> <br />However, recalling the amount of rice Saito used to eat on weekends, Lily quickly understood.<br /> <br />In reality, Saito confessed that he had been eating out to satisfy his hunger.<br /> <br />“……”<br /> <br />Upon hearing this, Lily slightly opened her mouth, as if about to say something, but the words didn’t come out, dissipating in the wind.<br /> <br />(What was she trying to say?)<br /> <br />Saito felt puzzled by his childhood friend’s mysterious behavior, but it was impossible to know what she was trying to say with just that.<br /> <br />Abandoning the thought, Saito started eating the second bento.<br /> <br />“Your bento is tastier. Let me eat again, even if I’m a guinea pig.”<br /> <br />“~!?”<br /> <br />And then, Saito realized that Lily’s homemade bento suited his taste better than the ones prepared by his mother, Yabana, over the years.<br /> <br />It was a mystery why Lily’s cooking was closer to his preference than what Yabana, who had been cooking for him for years, would make.<br /> <br />So, after trying it, Saito genuinely thought so.<br /> <br />Therefore, when Saito conveyed that to her, this childhood friend covered her face with both hands.<br /> <br />Seeing a bit of her skin turning red through the gaps in her fingers, it was clear she was embarrassed.<br /> <br />While thinking it’s a bit exaggerated to be praised for a lunch box, Saito took a bite of the vegetable stir-fry.<br /> <br />Without knowing that his words had hit Lily’s heart cleanly, Saito expressed his feelings.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The next day.<br /> <br />“Here, another bento.”<br /> <br />“Huh, really!? You’re giving me one again today!? Thanks!”<br /> <br />On the way to school, as usual, Saito met Lily on the station platform and received a handbag with a bento from her.<br /> <br />“I have more requests than I thought I would have,. Until I make all of them, be the guinea pig for us.”<br /> <br />“If I can eat your food, anything’s fine. What’s on the menu today?”<br /> <br />“Fried chicken and sweet and sour pork. The rest is almost the same as yesterday.”<br /> <br />“What are these dishes that understand a man’s heart? Are either Yakumo or Minaka definitely a guy from a past life?”<br /> <br />Although he was declared a guinea pig naturally, Saito didn’t mind at all, as long as he could eat the bento.<br /> <br />After hearing the contents of today’s bento from Lily and expressing how delicious it looked, Saito was overjoyed like a child.<br /> <br />Thus, Saito and Lily’s relationship began, where he would receive a bento from her every day for taste testing.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Saito-kun, can we play rock-paper-scissors today too?”<br /> <br />However, as with good things, there are also bad things.<br /> <br />Upon arriving at school, Saito found Mizuki and Koyuki again in a fierce battle over lunch with Haruki.<br /> <br />Thinking about what they were doing, Saito ignored them and welcomed the next break.<br /> <br />When Haruki asked Saito to play rock-paper-scissors today too, Saito was taken aback.<br /> <br />“Huh? Didn’t I tell you to decide properly yesterday?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, but the pressure from those two is incredible. I don’t know what they’ll do if I refuse. So please, Saito-kun, can you be the referee for rock-paper-scissors to decide who I’ll have lunch with?”<br /> <br />Despite having firmly instructed him to decide yesterday, Saito asked why he didn’t choose a partner, and Haruki explained the overwhelming pressure he received from the two.<br /> <br />“I don’t want to. You should play rock-paper-scissors yourself.”<br /> <br />“Well, it seems insincere to decide it randomly. Come on, please.”<br /> <br />“You’re serious in a weird way, dude.”<br /> <br />“Saito-kun, you’re my only hope!”<br /> <br />“Ugh, just for today.”<br /> <br />“Thank you!”<br /> <br />Even though Saito thought he should decide properly even if he was being threatened,<br /> <br />Haruki didn’t give up.<br /> <br />He hugged Saito’s leg and pleaded with a serious face.<br />Feeling sorry for Haruki, Saito reluctantly agreed to be the referee for today’s lunchtime rock-paper-scissors, and from then on, he became the one in charge of Haruki’s harem rock-paper-scissors.</p>
