<h2>Chapter 4: The Trial of God</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>&quot;What is this place?&quot;</p>

<p>My field of vision went dark, and when I opened my eyes again, I seemed to be in a fifty-meter square space surrounded by stone tiles.</p>

<p>It was like being inside a giant cube.</p>

<p>There seemed to be torches burning with a pale blue flame set up around me, and while it was dim, the room was bright enough.</p>

<p>Looking around, it seems that all the clearers participating are present.</p>

<p>However, the Cube to return to reality isn&rsquo;t here; a one-way ticket huh.</p>

<p>&quot;So there&rsquo;s no Cube to return, huh... Alright, let's start by checking the number of people! Please respond when your name is called!&quot;</p>

<p> Tanaka-san called out names one after another from the participant roster.</p>

<p>I also responded, and after all the names were called, the American soldier next to me also took attendance.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, it seems like everyone is here. First, everyone standby! There's no cube to return, but don't panic!&quot;</p>

<p>We were given the standby order, and several people including Tanaka-san began investigating this room.</p>

<p>A giant box surrounded by stone on all sides.</p>

<p>And in front of me were three huge paintings drawn on the stone wall.</p>

<p>The three paintings were lined up in order. As I started looking at them from the left-</p>

<p>&quot;Is this a battle? Between a demon... and a human? No, a knight?&quot;</p>

<p>On the first painting, there was a depiction of a battle between a human and a grotesque creature resembling a monster.</p>

<p>The human held a sword and wore armor, giving the appearance of a knight.</p>

<p>That knight was fighting something that looked like a demon, although it was unclear what exactly it was.</p>

<p>&quot;Next... a knight and an angel?</p>

<p>So, the first one is also a knight after all...&quot;</p>

<p>On the second painting, there seemed to be a knight and an angel.</p>

<p>A person knelt down with both hands clasped and prostrated towards what seemed to be an angel.</p>

<p>I felt like I had seen it somewhere before... oh, that thing, a Knighting Ceremony. I saw it in an anime; I&rsquo;m pretty sure I remember that it&rsquo;s the pose a knight makes when pledging loyalty to their lord.</p>

<p>&quot;And finally... I can't tell anything from this one, it's all torn up and I can't make sense of it...&quot;</p>

<p>Only the last painting was in tatters, and although it was clear that it was a painting, it was impossible to tell what was depicted on it.</p>

<p>Still, one thing could be vaguely discerned. At the top of the torn painting, there was a triangle-shaped mark.</p>

<p>It was like a pyramid-shaped triangle with an eye in the center.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this painting before.</p>

<p>I think its name was the Omnipotent Eye or something like that right?</p>

<p>Somehow or another, I&rsquo;ve seen it on the web before.</p>

<p>As I stared at the mural lost in thought, Tanaka-san came over to me and looked up at the painting. He murmured as he looked at the eye symbol in the center of the triangle.</p>

<p>&quot;That is... the Eye of Providence... God's all-seeing eye. Where on earth are we?&quot;</p>

<p>I seem to have seen this painting somewhere before. Wasn't it called that? I think I saw it on the internet or something.</p>

<p>As he slowly touched the painting...</p>

<p>It happened.</p>

<p>&#12302;The Trial of Strength will begin. 60 participants... Time until start, 10, 9, ...... &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha-?!&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately, an artificial voice resounded in our heads.</p>

<p>We looked at each other, realizing that it was not just our imagination, but something that everyone could hear.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, get ready for battle!! We don't know what's going to happen!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san quickly unsheathed his sword and took a stance back-to-back with his comrades. I, too, didn't know what was happening, but I unsheathed my long sword and prepared.</p>

<p>&#12302;6, 5... &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell is going on!! What's happening?!&quot;</p>

<p>Satou showed signs of panic and agitation, along with his comrades.</p>

<p>&quot;Issei, what on earth is happening...&quot;</p>

<p>The woman next to Tanaka also drew her sword and stared at the door with sharp eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. &lsquo;The Trial of Strength... For now, don't die, Midori.&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;&#65296;&#9472;&#9472;&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I&rsquo;m! I'm ready to die! For the sake of Nagi!&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;&#9472;&#9472;It's time. The Trial of Strength will now begin.&#12303;</p>

<p>And then my vision went black.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;...Where am I?&quot;</p>

<p>When I noticed, I was alone, holding my sword in a room similar to the first one.</p>

<p>The other challengers had disappeared, but it&rsquo;s probable that I arrived at a different room alone.</p>

<p>It was a 50-meter square room, but the only difference from the first room was that the huge door was missing.</p>

<p>And there was one more difference.</p>

<p>&quot;...The Trial of Strength... It&rsquo;s telling me, &lsquo;Fight.&rsquo; huh...&quot;</p>

<p>In front of me, about ten meters away, stood a hobgoblin.</p>

<p>Holding a wooden club, a green, ugly demon.</p>

<p>It had long ears and a long nose, but it was clearly bigger than the normal goblins and about the same size as me.</p>

<p>&quot;GYAAAHHH!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblin is the gateway boss for beginner clearers.</p>

<p>It appears as the boss in many E-class dungeons.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is generally not a difficult enemy.</p>

<p>However, in my case as an unranked adventurer, even the E-rank Hobgoblin can pose a challenge.</p>

<p>If I have this magic powered imbued sword with me, I might have a chance in this fight...</p>

<p>&quot;Huu... so this is the trial, to defeat this guy. The weakest boss... still, it's a high hurdle for me.&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblins are always massacred by Sato and his friends.</p>

<p>However, that&rsquo;s because as D-Ranks and since there&rsquo;s three of them, they are able to do that.</p>

<p>For me, it's my first encounter with a monster, let alone a one-on-one battle.</p>

<p>I wouldn't survive a single hit from that club.</p>

<p>&quot;Guu!&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblin runs towards me, attempting to kill me, and swings his club downwards.</p>

<p>I dodged to the side, avoiding the strike.</p>

<p>I broke out in a cold sweat, but I successfully managed to avoid it.</p>

<p>I seem to be faster than this goblin, but I'm probably weaker in terms of strength.</p>

<p>I look at the stone tile floor that the goblin hit with its club. It&rsquo;s cracked.</p>

<p>Even if I had that club, I have no chance of being able to crack that.</p>

<p>&quot;While dodging, slowly whittle it down... carefully carry out both.&quot;</p>

<p>My strategy is to gradually whittle it down with my sword without taking a hit.</p>

<p>As someone who has the advantage of speed, I thought this strategy would be the most effective.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gaahhh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The intense battle had begun. Despite the fear, I was able to keep my composure because I had prepared myself for this moment. Even if I died, my little sister would continue to receive treatment from the country as the surviving family member of a clearer.</p>

<p>For that reason, I challenged this over-the-top dungeon.</p>

<p>Still, I don't want to die. I have resolved that it's okay to die, but there&rsquo;s no harm in being able to clear it.</p>

<p>I cut carefully, finely, without making any mistakes. If I get hit once, with that power, I'll lose consciousness and it&rsquo;ll all be over.</p>

<p>That's why I won&rsquo;t let my guard down even for a moment.</p>

<p>The only things I, who has nothing, can do is not to give up and...</p>

<p>Risk my life.</p>

<p>&quot;Gi...&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblin was breathing raggedly. Perhaps it had shed too much blood? It was covered in light wounds and purple blood was dripping down its green skin.</p>

<p>&quot;Haa haa haa...&quot;</p>

<p>However, I was the same. In order to safely avoid its attacks, I had been dodging with all my might and was consuming a lot of energy.</p>

<p>It will be decided by the next blow.</p>

<p>I thought so, and maybe the Hobgoblin thought so too. I grip my heavy sword tightly, and the Hobgoblin grips his club tightly.</p>

<p>We both start running at the same time.</p>

<p>The Hobgoblin swings his club from above, just like before. I've seen it many times, so I dodged to the side in the same way.</p>

<p>At that moment,</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh!?&quot;</p>

<p>I was hit in the stomach by the Hobgoblin's swipe.</p>

<p>I was na&iuml;ve, I hadn&rsquo;t intentionally let my guard down.</p>

<p>Even so, I had underestimated this life and death situation.</p>

<p>Just like in the previous attacks and defenses that we repeated over and over, it was again an overhead swing, I thought.</p>

<p>After all, it's just a monster with no thinking ability, I thought.</p>

<p>The hobgoblin probably anticipated that I would dodge to the side, using the overhead swing as a feint.</p>

<p>They understood that their side was the one truly putting their life on the line. They understood what it meant to fight.</p>

<p>I roll to the side with the same momentum.</p>

<p>&quot;pant, pant...this hurts....&quot;</p>

<p>Blood flows from my mouth. And I glare at the hobgoblin.</p>

<p>Its ugly face grins at me, confident of its victory.</p>

<p>As my consciousness began to fade, I thought to myself:</p>

<p>I don't want to die.</p>

<p>As soon as I thought that fear took over my body.</p>

<p>The moment I felt the reality of death, my body and mind were hit with a sense of dissociation. I couldn't muster any strength.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m scared.</p>

<p>If I don't do anything here, if I just stand here, certain death will come in a few seconds.</p>

<p>Death is right there.</p>

<p>An indescribable feeling of my 18-year-long life ending so easily overwhelms me and my body stiffens.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't come near me!!&quot;</p>

<p>Grinning, the hobgoblin walks toward me while dragging its club.</p>

<p>I took a step back for the first time, probably out of fear.</p>

<p>Although I thought I was prepared to die, I really wasn't prepared at all.</p>

<p>I didn't understand what it meant to fight, what it meant to risk your life and kill each other.</p>

<p>When I felt scared, it was only for a moment; my then body froze with the realization of death.</p>

<p>&quot;Giyyyy!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblin raises its club and runs towards me.</p>

<p>&quot;NO, nO, DON&rsquo;T COME!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I closed my eyes in the middle of the fight. I turned my gaze away.</p>

<p>(Nagi...I'm sorry...)</p>

<p>The last thing that came to mind was the words of my little sister.</p>

<p>And then...</p>

<p>&#65290;</p>

<p>&#12302;Nagi, I'll definitely save you. I promise.&#12303;</p>

<p>&#65290;</p>

<p>The last words I conveyed to Nagi.</p>

<p>Immediately after, I opened my eyes wide.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I screamed from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>Angered by my own foolishness, I forced my trembling body to move with a loud voice.</p>

<p>I had certainly prepared myself for death.</p>

<p>But to think that I could just accept dying, am I an idiot?</p>

<p>I decided to do my best, and Nagi is also doing her best. I, who can move freely, can't give up easily!</p>

<p>I lifted my face up.</p>

<p>I caught the hobgoblin's club that it swung down with one hand using my left arm.</p>

<p>With a crunching sound, my left arm was shattered, but I deflected the club back behind me. A pain that made me want to scream shook my whole body.</p>

<p>Even so, I gritted my teeth and grabbed the heavy sword with both hands. Bones were broken, and blood spurted out when I exerted my strength.</p>

<p>But even then, I still held on tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Waaaaa!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I gripped the sword tightly with both my broken left hand and right hand.</p>

<p>I stabbed the sword into the hobgoblin's exposed belly in a frenzy.</p>

<p>The hobgoblin didn't seem to expect to be countered and reacted slowly.</p>

<p>It tried to stop the sword with its own arm, grabbing onto it.</p>

<p>&quot;Gyaaa!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Raaa!!!&quot;</p>

<p> From then on, it was a battle of strength. Would I be able to pierce it? Or would the hobgoblin stop me and kill me?</p>

<p>I must shout from the bottom of my stomach.</p>

<p>This is where I need to pour everything I have out.</p>

<p>&quot;Aaaaahhhhhh!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gyaaaaa!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I kept screaming.</p>

<p>I screamed and screamed, and even while my left hand was spouting blood and my bones were visible, I never let up.</p>

<p>I won't die like this.</p>

<p>I won't die here like this.</p>

<p>I haven't done anything yet; I haven't achieved anything yet.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to save Nagi!</p>

<p>&quot;AAAAAAHHHHH!!!&quot;</p>

<p> I kept pushing with all my might, in a frenzy.</p>

<p>I didn't know how much time had passed, I just kept screaming.</p>

<p>It wasn't until my grip, contrary to my willpower, reached its limit and the sword slipped from my bloodied hand that I realized my voice was the only one echoing in the room.</p>

<p>I fell forward onto the goblin with momentum.</p>

<p>Immediately, I lifted my face and tried to grab my sword.</p>

<p>However, in the process, I realized that the goblin had completely stopped moving.</p>

<p>&quot;Haa haa... I... defeated it?&quot;</p>

<p>I look at the hobgoblin's condition.</p>

<p>My sword had pierced its stomach and the hobgoblin had died with its tongue hanging out.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I win?&quot;</p>

<p>I won the battle.</p>

<p>It was a narrow victory, hardly deserving to be called a triumph.</p>

<p>But still, it was my first victory. For the first time in my life, I had defeated an opponent I wasn't sure I could beat.</p>

<p>I fell back and looked up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>Suddenly aware of the intense pain in my left arm, I writhed in agony, unable to savor the sweet taste of victory. Then I heard that voice.</p>

<p>&#12302;Challenger: Kai Amachi. You have cleared the Trial of Strength. Teleporting now.&#12303;</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>&quot;Wait, where am I? Gu!? O-Ow...&quot;</p>

<p>Just as I heard that inorganic voice, I collapsed back into the original room. I must have been transferred; after a moment of floating feeling, I realized I was here. My sword had also been transferred next to me.</p>

<p>More importantly, my left arm was in extreme pain. Tears streamed down my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and another woman ran towards me as I lay on the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a bad injury. Midori, I'm counting on you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure. It hurts a bit, hold on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;AHHHGH!!!&quot;</p>

<p>The tough-looking, beautiful older woman with short black hair, named Midori, forcibly pulled my broken left hand and reattached it into the correct shape.</p>

<p>I screamed in agony.</p>

<p>&quot;Endure it! You're a man, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh, Ugh. Yes, thank you...&quot;</p>

<p>Then Midori placed both hands on my left hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a gentle green light enveloped me. This was healing magic. Rarely, some people can use magic to heal injuries, so it was probably that.</p>

<p>But to attach bones at this speed...she&rsquo;s probably a fairly high-level magic healer, isn&rsquo;t she?</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, it's attached. If you make it back alive, be sure to go to the hospital. It's been forced into place so the positioning is bad. Also, I fixed your other injuries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's amazing...uh, thank you so much!&quot;</p>

<p>I made a fist with my left hand.</p>

<p>It still hurt, but it was enough to move.</p>

<p>So, this is healing magic...truly a power of fantasy.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, it's a freebie today, but in the outside world, I could get a million yen for this.&quot;</p>

<p>Midori-san giggles and winks.</p>

<p>Healing magic is very valuable, and therefore expensive.</p>

<p>So it's not a joke, in reality, this much treatment would probably cost that much.</p>

<p>&quot;Th-thank you so much.&quot;</p>

<p>I stand up and express my gratitude as much as possible. Tanaka-san then bends down in front of me, seeking a handshake.</p>

<p>&quot;You survived well. I'm Issei Tanaka, and this is Midori Tendo, the healing magician of our guild.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm Kai Amachi, an unranked adventurer...but...somehow I managed to survive.&quot;</p>

<p>I shake his hand.</p>

<p>Looking closely, Tanaka-san seems to have been injured as well; his clothes are covered in blood.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Unranked...Kai-kun. You did well. You're the fifth person to return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I look around and see that there are only five adventurers in the room, including Tanaka-san and me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hai-kun, what did you fight?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I fought a hobgoblin. It's weak, but for me, it was a formidable opponent.&quot;</p>

<p>I say with a little embarrassment.</p>

<p>It's a little embarrassing that I struggled against an opponent like a hobgoblin, whom Tanaka-san could easily kill with one hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Hobgoblin...no, there's no need to be ashamed. Soloing it was a truly difficult opponent for you. Well done. So then...&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san looks at Midori-san, who nods.</p>

<p>&quot;Hai-kun, I fought a high ogre, an upper B-rank monster. It's a step away from A-rank, and I could have died if I made one mistake. I managed to win in a close battle. Midori here fought a similar battle. It was a truly difficult fight, and you were in the same situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? So, then...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, probably, there's a formidable opponent for everyone that's barely possible to beat. I thought it was impossible, but this dungeon is clearly too different from previous ones. And... that mechanical voice as well as the meaning of the words &lsquo;Knight of God Selection&rsquo; and 'Trial of Strength.' Heh, I'm an atheist, but I'm starting to believe in a God. But it's quite a mean God.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san then looks a little gloomy.</p>

<p>I can't take Tanaka-san's words at face value, but at least I affirm the existence of a higher being.</p>

<p>Maybe not an Omniscient and omnipotent one but at least a God with power beyond human knowledge.</p>

<p>&quot;Hm? Sorry, Hai-kun. See you later.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and Midori-san head to the next clearers who appear.</p>

<p>I stare at the door for a while.</p>

<p>A pyramid with a triangular shape and an eyeball pattern.</p>

<p>If this is God's trial, then how long will it continue?</p>

<p>As I stare at the door vaguely, that inorganic voice is heard.</p>

<p>&#12302;Challengers of the Trial of Strength. Everything has ended. 15 out of 60 have cleared. Seconds until the next trial. 1000, 999, 998... &#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't believe what the voice had just said.</p>

<p>Dead? 45 out of 60, including military personnel, have died?</p>

<p>I looked around, but there were only a few survivors among the many clearers.</p>

<p>And all of them were badly injured.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, gather here!&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after the announcement, Tanaka-san instructed us to gather in the center.</p>

<p>&quot;As you can all hear, the next trial is about to begin. We don't know if we'll be separated again or what will happen, so we can't prepare for it but-&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?! Are you kidding me?! You're the one in charge!&quot;</p>

<p>Then I heard a familiar voice.</p>

<p>It was Sato. He must have survived the battle, judging from his torn clothes.</p>

<p>Whether it was due to luck or skill, he seemed to have some combat sense.</p>

<p>&quot;This is impossible! We were told it was safe!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let us go home!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take responsibility! How many people do you think died?!&quot;</p>

<p>The complaints kept coming left and right.</p>

<p>Even I, who had braced myself for death, felt like complaining.</p>

<p>But it was pointless to say it to Tanaka-san.</p>

<p>As the angry voices continued, I started to become frustrated.</p>

<p>The surrounding began to become noisy, but then...</p>

<p>&quot;Quiet!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san's loud voice silenced everyone.</p>

<p>&quot;You can complain all you want after you survive. With as much guarantee as possible, I'll do my best to negotiate with the government and the association. But that's only if you survive. What we need to do now is not to fight amongst ourselves, but to do our best to survive. If you understand, Listen to me quietly!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san's calm demeanor and forceful words silenced everyone, including Sato.</p>

<p>&quot;Ok. Fortunately, we have about 10 minutes left. We don't know what kind of trial we'll face next, but hurry up and get some food and water. You can use whatever is available here. Some of you have lost a lot of blood. Come on, hurry up! We don't have much time! The most severely injured come here first, and we'll do our best to treat you!&quot;</p>

<p>Following Tanaka-san's instructions, we quickly grabbed some food and water.</p>

<p>I needed a lot of fluids because I had lost a lot of blood.</p>

<p>I felt dizzy, but the water helped.</p>

<p>&#12302;Can I talk to you for a moment, Mr. Tanaka?&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Oh, Alfred Lieutenant.&#12303;</p>

<p>I saw Tanaka-san and an American military person having a conversation while I drank water. I only understand English vaguely, but it seems Tanaka-san can speak it fluently.</p>

<p>I heard the military person call a name but, could it be that strong looking Alfred?</p>

<p> With a hat pulled over his eyes, his gaze is very sharp.</p>

<p>His strong physique looks as if he could take on a 100 of me at once.</p>

<p>&#12302;I want you to entrust command of the Japanese to me. I'm Class S, you know that? Five out of nine of my subordinates died, and they were all Class A. We can expect an even tougher situation to come. You're clever enough to understand that we need someone to be a sacrifice when the time comes.&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;I'll be in charge of the Japanese. That was supposed to be agreed by both countries. And I won't use sacrificial pawns.&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;...Hmm, that&rsquo;s right, you aren&rsquo;t a soldier, you&rsquo;re just a civilian. It&rsquo;s okay to talk about ideals but reality is something you need to look at. If it becomes a tight situation, I won&rsquo;t hesitate.&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;...We can only pray that it doesn&rsquo;t become that.&#12303;</p>

<p>The man called Colonel Alfred then returned to the military group.</p>

<p>There were ten soldiers, but now only five were left.</p>

<p>All of them were battered and exhausted.</p>

<p>They had risked their lives, surpassed the trial, and were now exhausted.</p>

<p>It was not exhaustion that could be cured in ten minutes. However, the countdown continued even if they did nothing.</p>

<p>There were those who were scared and trembling, those who shed tears for losing their friends, and those who just expressed their anger.</p>

<p>Everyone was focused on the countdown.</p>

<p>&#12302;It's time. The Trial of Knowledge, worship God, will begin. There are fifteen participants... Ten, nine...&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Eight, seven...&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;USA! USA!&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;OORAH! OORAH!&#12303;</p>

<p>The US military formed a circle and raised their voices to boost morale.</p>

<p>&#12302;Six, five...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;What exactly is the Trial of Knowledge?&quot;</p>

<p>Midori-san muttered as if pondering.</p>

<p>&#12302;Four, three...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it, damn it! I'll survive. I won't die! I'm not a loser!&quot;</p>

<p>Sato shouted loudly to encourage himself.</p>

<p>&#12302;Two, one...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... okay. I'm ready. I can fight now. I won't give up until the end.&quot;</p>

<p>I reminded myself out loud not to repeat my previous mistake.</p>

<p>&#12302;Zero&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, I pray for your success!&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;It is time. Transferring now.&#12303;</p>

<p>And then, our view faded to black.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>&quot;This place... is the room the same? No, there's no ceiling? And everyone is here?&quot;</p>

<p>We were transferred and gathered in the same room instead of separate ones this time. All 15 of us were in the same square room, which was about 50 meters long on each side.</p>

<p>The difference from before was that there was no ceiling, and a pitch-black darkness spread out into the sky.</p>

<p>And there was one more thing.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san muttered as he looked at the drawing on the floor at his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this an eye? And over there, hands, feet... body... no, is that a torso?&quot;</p>

<p>The floor of the square room was further divided into four more square areas, each with a drawing of eyes, feet, hands, and torso.</p>

<p>We were all in the area with the drawing of hands right now.</p>

<p>To the immediate left was the area with feet, the upper left corner was the area with the torso, and the upper right corner was the area with the eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;What on earth... is this... huh?&quot;</p>

<p>As Tanaka-san seemed lost in thought, he suddenly looked up and noticed something. All of us were drawn to look in the same direction.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that?&quot;</p>

<p>I gazed at that shining something.</p>

<p>It was descending slowly and gradually; Really, what is that?</p>

<p>It radiated a golden light, had pure white wings, and was holding a sword in its hand.</p>

<p>Its face was like that of a mannequin, a fabricated face.</p>

<p>&quot;An angel?&quot;</p>

<p>The first thing I thought when I saw that descending object was that it was an angel.</p>

<p>It looked a bit creepy to be called an angel.</p>

<p>Still, it shone in golden radiance, and the divine white wings were those of an angel.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, be on guard!&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;All members, prepare to intercept!&#12303;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and Colonel Alfred almost simultaneously shouted upon seeing the angel. At the same time, everyone prepared their weapons.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<p>*Gashaaan!*</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I dropped my sword.</p>

<p>Not just me, everyone dropped their swords, shields, and axes they had been holding.</p>

<p>It was as if our hands had suddenly become immovable.</p>

<p>&quot;My arm...&quot;</p>

<p>I had lost the sensation in my arm.</p>

<p>There was no pain, and my arm was still attached, but there was no sign of it moving, as if my brain and arm had been completely separated.</p>

<p>&quot;What the... what's happening!&quot;</p>

<p>Sato was panicking.</p>

<p>&#12302;Colonel!! What is this?!&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Don't panic, hold your formation!&#12303;</p>

<p>It was the same for everyone, struggling but unable to move, their hands unable to rise against gravity, hanging limply downward.</p>

<p>And then the angel landed before one of the explorers.</p>

<p>The clearer had a large body and looked like a seasoned warrior.</p>

<p>However, his thick arms were now completely useless, rather a hindrance.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, ah...&quot;</p>

<p>The angel was smaller than the clearer.</p>

<p>Even so, the pressure emanating from that angel made it seem impossible to win against it.</p>

<p>We couldn't move.</p>

<p>The angel slowly lifted the sword and placed it on the shoulder of the clearer.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the angel's mannequin-like face tilted its head.</p>

<p>&quot;St...stop it...stop it!!&quot;</p>

<p>The clearer trembled, but the mannequin tilted its head even more.</p>

<p>*Zashu.*</p>

<p>The conqueror's head was decapitated.</p>

<p>The head flew in front of me and rolled on the ground.</p>

<p>As I gritted my teeth, my eyes met with those that were shedding tears of blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Waaaah!!!&quot;</p>

<p>With my scream, red blood scattered around.</p>

<p>At that moment, the clearers who seemed to have been paralyzed began to shout one after another.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, run away!&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;Evacuate! Keep your distance!&#12303;</p>

<p>Everyone moved away from the angel, following Tanaka-san's loud voice.</p>

<p>The clearers fled from the angel as if they were scattering spiderlings.</p>

<p>I also ran away with all my might.</p>

<p>I didn't know what was happening, but I didn't feel like I could beat that angel.</p>

<p>I couldn't even think of choosing to confront it from the beginning.</p>

<p>Everyone probably felt the same way, including Tanaka-san, an A-class who could basically be considered a monster.</p>

<p>Alfred, the lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army, who seemed to be the strongest here, was the same.</p>

<p>I ran in the opposite direction of the angel.</p>

<p>In other words, towards the area marked with a foot symbol on the ground.</p>

<p>And the next moment, I fell down hard.</p>

<p>&quot;Guh!&quot;</p>

<p>Did I trip over something? But there was nothing there.</p>

<p>No, that's not it. Because when I looked around, everyone else had fallen in the same way.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my feet!&quot;</p>

<p>I noticed something strange.</p>

<p>I couldn't move my feet.</p>

<p>On the other hand, my arms moved as usual.</p>

<p>That's probably why I fell so hard.</p>

<p>&quot;What...what's wrong with my feet?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the floor where I fell.</p>

<p>There was a wall painting depicting feet.</p>

<p>It was just a hunch but judging from this situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m in this area&rsquo;s painting, I won&rsquo;t be able to move that body part!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I lay there having realized the rule, I looked behind me and saw the angel slowly standing in front of the conqueror who couldn't move his legs and was simply flapping them.</p>

<p>Again, the angel placed the sword on his shoulder and tilted its head, then cut off the clearer&rsquo;s head as if it was a matter of course.</p>

<p>Then, one of the conquerors stood up and returned to the hand area.</p>

<p>With a trembling voice, he shouted at the angel.</p>

<p>&quot;Y-You bastard!! How dare you kill my brother!! I'm...I'm A-class!! Don't fuck with me!!&quot;</p>

<p>The clearer, without weapons and with his arm unable to lift, stood firm on the solid-looking floor and rushed toward the angel at an unimaginable speed.</p>

<p>As expected of an A-class, at that level he could be called a monster and a national power...</p>

<p>His full power knee kick flew like a missile.</p>

<p>I thought the knee hit the angel, but it passed as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>No, for a moment, I felt like the angel moved at an impossible speed.</p>

<p>But at my current level, I don't really understand what happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>However, as I watched, the clearer crashed into the wall with the same momentum.</p>

<p>And with a sound of squish hitting the wall, the clearer fell over.</p>

<p>&quot;No way... He was cut?&quot;</p>

<p>The strategist had no head.</p>

<p>The high-flying head fell while scattering red blood.</p>

<p>An existence at the strongest level of humanity, an A-rank, was killed by having their head cut off at an unfollowable speed without being able to resist.</p>

<p>Tanaka opened his mouth with an expression of disbelief at seeing it.</p>

<p>&quot;This is too unreasonable... What kind of trial is this?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and Midori-san while crawling on the ground, their faces turned blue.</p>

<p>Not even mentioning beating the angel in a normal situation, but we had to win with the handicap of not being able to move a part of our bodies.</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re a high-ranking clearer, you can&rsquo;t fight without being able to move your arms or legs.</p>

<p>&quot;Even S-rank Colonel Alfred couldn't handle something like this... Kai-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>With all my might I rushed toward Tanaka-san and Midori-san, who were at the forefront.</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san, Midori-san! Probably, if you are in the area where this design is present, that body part won't move!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!?... Oh, I see, there was a picture of an arm drawn here. You noticed it well in this situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's why I'm going to enter that torso area. If there's anything wrong with the heart not moving, it's almost certain death, but we have to try it now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun!? Th-that's too dangerous!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we'll just die like this. I... I won't give up!! Tanaka-san, if anything happens, please pull me back here!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Understood! Leave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san hesitated for a moment but immediately nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>It was truly impressive how decisive he was in times like this. His serious gaze met mine straight on.</p>

<p>&#12302;Hey! What are you doing!?&#12303;</p>

<p>Colonel Alfred, flustered, questioned me.</p>

<p>But I had no time to answer and understanding of English.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san, Midori-san, and I moved forward only with the strength of our arms, until we reached the design of the torso.</p>

<p>Behind us, with a scream, the angel, in the same way, slowly launched a clearer&rsquo;s head, and moved onto the next target.</p>

<p>&quot;...Then, here I go!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it to me! If anything strange happens, I'll pull you back immediately!&quot;</p>

<p>And then, I jumped into the torso as if rolling.</p>

<p>&quot;Gah!?&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after, I held my chest.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>&quot;Gah!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san tried to pull me with just his arm strength as I made a surprised face, but I stopped him with my hand. I quickly rolled back to the area with my feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Huff, huff, Tanaka-san. I understand now! The torso area makes it impossible to breathe!&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I entered that area, I realized that I couldn't take in oxygen. I don't know if the function of the lungs was stopped or if the act of breathing was forbidden.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. The torso is the lungs, which means breathing. Then, the rest...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san, Midori-san, and I rushed into the torso area with force and stood up. We aimed for the last area, the eye area. Even if we couldn't breathe, as clearers with magical power, we could run dozens of meters even when holding our breath for a few seconds.</p>

<p>The three of us stepped into the eye area.</p>

<p>If my intuition was correct, this area is...</p>

<p>&quot;As I thought! Tanaka-san, this is!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. I can't see anything. It's like my vision has been taken away. But other than that, I can move my limbs and breathe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we catch our breath here and look around while holding our breath in the torso area, we can last for a while. Then...&quot;</p>

<p>We regained our breath and went to the torso area. When we opened our eyes, there were still about five people in the leg area, the entire area was covered in blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Shit...&quot;</p>

<p>Of the fifteen adventurers, only eight were left. Tanaka-san, Midori-san, Sato, Alfred Colonel, and three soldiers.</p>

<p>As well as one more person who had a emotionless, doll-like face with a sword on their shoulder.</p>

<p>&#12302;Stop it, why... damn it! Damn it!!&#12303;</p>

<p>One of the soldiers desperately resisted and grabbed the angel's arm. He squeezed it with the force of a class A vise, but the angel launched his head as if nothing was there.</p>

<p>Now there were only seven left.</p>

<p>The angel chose its next target, Colonel Alfred.</p>

<p>&quot;Shit, shit!! What is this monster!! I have to return back to the U.S. and report this!&#12303;</p>

<p>Alfred is unable to do anything but flutter his feet around.</p>

<p>Afred then spots a boy in front of him.</p>

<p>It's just Sato, crying and screaming.</p>

<p>&#12302;Sorry, boy.&#12303;</p>

<p>Alfred grabs Sato with one hand and throws him towards the angel.</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaaah!&quot;</p>

<p>Sato collides with the angel, but the angel doesn't even flinch and just stares at Sato with its eyeless face.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether Sato either can't move from fear or is confused about why he can't move but he just flails his arms and legs.</p>

<p>For a moment, a dark emotion wells up inside me as I see Sato, who had said that people like me and Nagi should just die.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>&quot;...Shit!&quot;</p>

<p>I hit my own cheek hard.</p>

<p>It might have been wrong, but there was nothing I could do since I had already acted.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>I run towards Sato.</p>

<p>I can't breathe, but I can still run, and I can still yell since there's still air.</p>

<p>&quot;Sato! Come this way! Crawl if you have to!&quot;</p>

<p>I desperately call out to Sato.</p>

<p>I step into the leg area and while falling, catch my breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Sato responds to my voice while still crying. The other players react as well and run towards us with a desperate expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Over here, Sato! You can't move over there! We can breathe over here, but we need to move quickly!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Ahh!&quot;</p>

<p>Sato tries his best to come towards us as if he has found salvation.</p>

<p>The angel walks slowly from behind, but Sato seems to be faster. While in the chest area I stop my breath. stand up and pull Sato up.</p>

<p>&quot;Haa... I'm sorry...!?&quot;</p>

<p>Sato takes a breath and tries to calm down, but he suddenly holds his neck, looking like he's in pain. I thought I had told him that he couldn't breathe, but he didn't seem to understand because he was too panicked.</p>

<p>Sato panics and scratches his neck because he suddenly can't breathe.</p>

<p>&quot;Calm down!!&quot;</p>

<p>I try my best to calm Sato down, but I can't stop him from struggling. I'm just an unranked player, and Sato is C-ranked. He hits me, and I fall down.</p>

<p>And then, in that moment...</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>A sword is placed on my shoulder, and a cold sensation touches my cheek. I raise my head, and there is the angel, facing me with an emotionless, expressionless face.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, aah...&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;death&quot; pops into my head.</p>

<p>Just like the others, will I also have my head cut off?</p>

<p>Immediately, I felt the blood drain from my body.</p>

<p>The angel stares at me and tilts its head to the side.</p>

<p>This gesture again.</p>

<p>Why? Why are you tilting your head? What should I do?</p>

<p>Why does its stare feel like it&rsquo;s waiting on me?</p>

<p>At that moment, I remembered.</p>

<p>&#12302;The Trial of Knowledge----&#12303;</p>

<p>As well as the painted mural in the first room.</p>

<p>I get on one knee and then place my gripped fist to my heart.</p>

<p>And then I close my eyes and face downwards.</p>

<p>Like the mural on the wall, the knight assumes a pose of loyalty to his lord.</p>

<p>The angel and the knight, there lies false loyalty.</p>

<p>Even so, my actions unmistakably demonstrate my loyalty to this angel.</p>

<p>I can hear the sound of my heartbeat; it feels as though something is about to burst out of my mouth any moment.</p>

<p>I have no real evidence, but that huge mural was certainly a pose of loyalty to the angel.</p>

<p>Then, the feeling of the sword that was supposed to be on my shoulder disappeared.</p>

<p>I slowly lifted my head, and as I did, I saw that the angel was walking towards Sato.</p>

<p>In other words, I was saved.</p>

<p>&quot;Sato... that pose... from the mural!&quot;</p>

<p>While gasping for breath, I managed to instruct Sato.</p>

<p>Panicking, Sato understood the meaning of my words and the pose I was making, and he too clasped his hands together and knelt down.</p>

<p>The angel then gave us a satisfied expression.</p>

<p>(Thank goodness... this is the correct answer.)</p>

<p>I felt relieved, but...</p>

<p>(No! I can't breathe!)</p>

<p>Sato and I are making the same pose of loyalty, but we can't catch our breath.</p>

<p>The angel was just looking at us with a satisfied expression.</p>

<p>Only time passed, and we began heading towards death.</p>

<p>It must have been a minute or so, my face turned blue, and Sato's legs were shaking.</p>

<p>(This is it... I have to give it my all and run for it...)</p>

<p>It was the moment I felt that I had finally reached my limit and had no choice but to give it my all.</p>

<p>&quot;!?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, I was pushed aside.</p>

<p>It was Sato.</p>

<p>Sato shoved me to the side and showed me his usual mischievous smile.</p>

<p>And, just like always, told me.</p>

<p>&quot;I will survive! I will survive! I'm different from this trash!!&quot;</p>

<p>That one word must have come straight from Sato's heart.</p>

<p>I was surprised as I lost my balance, and Sato assumed the same pose again.</p>

<p>The angel's satisfied expression changed as it looked at me.</p>

<p>It turned into an expression full of anger, as if it was angry.</p>

<p>Sato was trying to lure me in as bait.</p>

<p>The angel began slowly approaching me.</p>

<p>I felt betrayed. I, who tried to help, am going to be killed by Sato.</p>

<p>I can no longer catch my breath, and I can&rsquo;t escape.</p>

<p>The area behind me is the leg area, I can&rsquo;t pledge loyalty there even if I can breathe.</p>

<p>Was I wrong?</p>

<p>Was it inappropriate for me to act to help someone?</p>

<p>Does self-sacrifice mean nothing in a battlefield?</p>

<p>Am I going to die here?</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun! Jump back!&quot;</p>

<p>That was when it happened.</p>

<p>I threw myself back as far as I could, following that voice.</p>

<p>Right after that, a huge wall of flames appeared between me and the angel.</p>

<p>I saw the exit.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun! Take the long way and come from the opposite side!!&quot;</p>

<p>It was Tanaka-san.</p>

<p>What he released was flame magic.</p>

<p>A huge wall of fire was created to separate the angel and I.</p>

<p>One of the skills of a mage with the ability to convert magic power into magic, specifically, a flame mage.</p>

<p>This scorching wall was probably created by Tanaka-san's magic power.</p>

<p>The intense wall of flames separated me and the angel, obscuring my view.</p>

<p>The angel, who had lost sight of me, turned its back to me through the wall of flames.</p>

<p>Sato seemed to be trying to escape once the angel had completely targeted me, but it stared at him, causing him to stumble and fall on his butt.</p>

<p>Then, a sword was placed on his shoulder, and he retook his posture of loyalty.</p>

<p>I rolled into the foot area and caught my breath.</p>

<p>I advanced with all my might, heading to the arm area.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sato's shoulder still had a sword placed on it, preventing him from moving.</p>

<p>I finally arrived at the arm area and, with my feet freed, ran straight to the eye area with all my might.</p>

<p>My field of vision disappeared, but since I was just running straight, I headed into the darkness towards the boundary between the eye and torso areas, where Tanaka-san and the others were.</p>

<p>&quot;Huff, huff, thank you, Tanaka-san. I appreciate it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad, Kai-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;...Having a hero complex on the battlefield... only something fools do.&#12303;</p>

<p>Colonel Alfred and two other military personnel were also there.</p>

<p>Colonel Alfred looked at me with disgust.</p>

<p>It must have been words meant for me, who was about to die trying to help someone, I was only able to understand the nuance.</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry. At least let me burn it into my memory.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san faced Sato and muttered apologetically.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry. It's my fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I judged that I had to kill him. You're more useful to me and necessary for the conquest. Besides, I was a little angry that he pushed you aside when you came to help.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Tanaka-san, you're not at fault. I decided to do that myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... but Kai-kun, don't go anymore. I can't save you next time.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeming to be about to dash off again, I was firmly grasped by Tanaka-san, showing he had no intention of letting me escape.</p>

<p>So, I closed my eyes and gave up.</p>

<p>I didn't want to involve Tanaka-san and the others in any more danger.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and I looked at Sato.</p>

<p>He couldn't breathe, and if he moved, his neck would be sliced off.</p>

<p>That angel smiled like a devil, with its sword resting on Sato's shoulder, just staring at him.</p>

<p>Sato was trembling.</p>

<p>He was probably crying, and when I looked at him from the side, he no longer looked strong, instead, just a frail student.</p>

<p>He, who always, while laughing would beat me down, was the strongest existence to me.</p>

<p>But now, was just too...</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-Hel...Tra...A..ma...chi...&rdquo;</p>

<p>That wilting voice forced out my name.</p>

<p>My name, which I hadn&rsquo;t heard from Sato&rsquo;s mouth in who knows how many years.</p>

<p>I understood that his breathing will no longer continue.</p>

<p>Sato is a bad guy, but I&rsquo;ve known him since high school.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that I wanted to punch him, who had given me the nickname &ldquo;trash&rdquo; and treated me like a sandbag.</p>

<p>Even then, this ending was...a bit pitiful.</p>

<p>Maybe Sato had finally reached his limit, he quickly stood up and reached his hand out toward us, seeking help.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-Help me. Amachi---&rdquo;</p>

<p>*Zashu*</p>

<p>At that moment, Sato&rsquo;s head was decapitated, and he died.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>Sato was beheaded and died.</p>

<p>The rolling head falls to the ground with a squishing sound.</p>

<p>I close my eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>I didn't feel too sad because I only had bad memories from him.</p>

<p>Still, the death of an acquaintance was a little heart-wrenching.</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san, I understand something. The only correct answer in this area is to take the posture of loyalty that we saw earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Yeah, with this just now I understood it too. We can only do that pose in the eye area; we can do it in the body area, but we can't hold our breath for long. Until we move, maybe we'll have to wait in front of the angel without breathing. That's quite sadistic.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san seemed to realize it too and moved to the eye area to share it with everyone.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone, to the eye area! Take the praying pose like before! You will be held with a sword on your shoulder, but do not move! Endure it!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san also informs Colonel Alfred.</p>

<p>&#12302;Colonel Alfred also understands, right?&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Yeah, thanks to that boy. A naive hero's desire... but sometimes God's favor occurs in the spirit of self-sacrifice. It's a stroke of good luck.&#12303;</p>

<p>Then we all enter the eye area and take the posture of loyalty.</p>

<p>There is a tapping sound.</p>

<p>The angel must be walking towards us slowly.</p>

<p>I sweat as the sword is placed on my shoulder.</p>

<p>Even though I knew it was okay, I felt like I might run away in fear.</p>

<p>The sword is placed on the right shoulder and then on the left shoulder.</p>

<p>Then the apparently satisfied angel's footsteps move to the side.</p>

<p>As I listen closely, I hear the sound of the angel flapping its wings, seemingly indicating that it has finished with everyone.</p>

<p>Immediately after that, our vision is restored, and I open my eyes.</p>

<p>The angel flaps its wings and disappears into the dark darkness that spreads to the ceiling and beyond.</p>

<p>Immediately after, I heard that lifeless voice.</p>

<p>&#12302;Challenger: Kai Amachi. The Trial of Knowledge has been cleared. Teleporting.&#12303;</p>

<p>At the same time I hear it, I and the others are teleported back to the first room.</p>

<p>I collapse on the floor in relief, and close my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I survived...&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;The Trial of Knowledge has ended. Six out of fifteen have cleared. The next trial will begin in 1000 seconds, 999, 998...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;There's more?&quot;</p>

<p>My bad feeling is confirmed.</p>

<p>Just how long will this continue? If there is power and knowledge, then what will be the next trial?</p>

<p>And I look at the painting. The left one must be the Trial of Strength, the middle one is the Trial of Knowledge.</p>

<p>And the next trial, which is the information I want to know the most, has a gap in the mural, and I can't see it clearly.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, thank you. I survived because of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While looking at the mural and contemplating, Tanaka-san and Midori-san walk up to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-No! I was just lucky.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. If you weren&rsquo;t there everyone would have died. No that I can calm down and think about it, I really was panicking and unable to think very well. Even though I&rsquo;m in the top guild, it&rsquo;s embarrassing. Wait, come over here. You have wounds, I&rsquo;ll heal you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;While I was still rolled over on the ground, Midori-san came over and tended to my wounds and healed me.</p>

<p>A kind, warm light wrapped around my body.</p>

<p>&#12302;Thanks for the help, lucky boy!&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Even though you're dumb, I like that. Hot blooded boy!&#12303;</p>

<p>While Midori-san was doing that, two soldiers came and ruffled my hair.</p>

<p>On those faces were the expressions of relief from surviving and feelings of thanks towards me.</p>

<p>From those large hands, I became a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#12302;Mr. Tanaka, at this point we should both share the information we have; don&rsquo;t you think? We&rsquo;re already past the point of chain of command talk at this point.&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Understood.&#12303;</p>

<p> We then sat down formed a circle, three Japanese and three US soldiers.</p>

<p>One after another, we began to introduce ourselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think many of you know but, I am a bottom A Rank mage. I am a fire-type. I can use a sword a bit, but I can&rsquo;t compare to someone with a warrior-type job.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Midori Tendo, I am a healing magician belonging to Avalon. I can fight to an extent but I am B-Class. By the way, I am planning to be Issei...Tanaka&rsquo;s wife. The ceremony will be in the future but...We will be married soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah- Is that so! Congratulations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;That&rsquo;s a happy thing. While being in a relationship, you really did something reckless that time... no maybe because you&rsquo;re in relationship huh? HAHAHA&#12303;</p>

<p>One after another, six people introduce themselves.</p>

<p>At first, I had a scary impression of the soldiers but with Tanaka-san&rsquo;s translations, my impression of them changed.</p>

<p>Everyone has a family, children they want to protect, and a country that they are fighting for.</p>

<p>While happily being shown those pictures of their family, I repeated to my self over and over again that I will survive no matter what.</p>

<p>That was the same for Colonel Alfred who tried to kill Sato by throwing him. I can&rsquo;t agree with that but to anyone, their own life is number one, even then, I can&rsquo;t permit it but I can understand.</p>

<p>Cold and ice. A good soldier but even still, blood flowed through those veins.</p>

<p>And then, my turn to introduce myself came around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am... Kai Amachi...I am...Unranked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;WHAT!? UNRANKED!? An unranked survived!? No way!?&rdquo;&#12303;</p>

<p>I was surprised at the soldier&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>They are A-Rank, even though there were many other strong people, the unranked who should be the weakest survived, is what he seemed to be surprised at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I made a complicated face, the two of them panicked and apologized.</p>

<p>&#12302;Sorry. We didn't mean any harm, but... you know, being an Unranked is like being just an ordinary person.&#12303;</p>

<p>Their argument was valid, and I understood it better than anyone else.</p>

<p>In the world where almost everyone has awakened, the Unranked are at the bottom of society and are unable to even defend themselves.</p>

<p>They are the Old Humans who possess little magical power.</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, was a human with only five magic power, I was called trash who couldn&rsquo;t win against anybody.</p>

<p>But Tanaka-san denied that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahh, he's Unranked. But that's precisely why he uses his head to survive. Unlike us, who have relied on a power we hardly understand called magical power. I genuinely admire him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tanaka-san...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san, as If comforting me, placed his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#12302;You ain&rsquo;t wrong! Lucky boy, I&rsquo;m relying on you for next time! My newly-wed wife is waiting at home, and I have to live to return to her&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;I'm the same! Well, my wife probably thinks I should die soon. Hahaha! But my daughter... she's still small. She's cute.&#12303;</p>

<p>The soldiers showed us the pendant they wore around their necks with their family's photo inside.</p>

<p>The little girl was adorable, and it momentarily eased the tense atmosphere.</p>

<p>Alfred didn't show us his pendant, but he probably had one too.</p>

<p>With the remaining time, we talked a lot about ourselves. Because of this situation, we could communicate from the bottom of our hearts, transcending language barriers.</p>

<p>Of course, everyone had a family, someone they loved waiting for them at home.</p>

<p>I was the same.</p>

<p>I had Nagi, my dearest sister, who was waiting for me in the darkness, trembling.</p>

<p>That's why I want to survive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, everyone, stand up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following Tanaka&rsquo;s words, we stood up and linked our shoulders.</p>

<p>It was like forming a circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's do our best until the end. If we combine our strength, we can overcome anything. When this is over, let's go for a drink! Japanese sushi is delicious, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;'OK OK! Good idea!&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;'Japanese food is great! Sukiyaki! Shabu-shabu! Sushi!&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;I like Japanese beer too. Especially Super Dry&#12303;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you drink, Kai-kun? You don't seem like someone who drinks much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm still underage, but since it's a special occasion, I'll have a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We laughed and linked our shoulders in a circle.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had done this since middle school, and I felt a little embarrassed. However, I was filled with a sense of determination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, let's end this and have a drink!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;OOoo!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;OORAH!!&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;The time has come. Participating members: 6. Teleporting.&#12303;</p>

<p> With that voice, our visions descended into darkness, and we teleported.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Where is this...?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where we were teleported was a small room</p>

<p>A classroom sized, small stone-tiled room, and in front of our eyes were two doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three people? Does this mean only three people can enter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On each of the two doors, the words, &lsquo;three people&rsquo; were written.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it, we&rsquo;re being split into two huh?...Then, how do we split three people into two...?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12302;That&rsquo;s decided, We go here, you three, there.&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Mhm, it comes down to that I guess.&#12303;</p>

<p>In a second, the groups are decided.</p>

<p>The three soldiers and, here with Tanaka-san, me, and Midori-san.</p>

<p>We three faced each other and shook each other&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>&#12302;Okay, Issei, Midori, Kai. I don&rsquo;t particularly like Japan that much but, I don&rsquo;t dislike you guys&#12303;</p>

<p>&#12302;Colonel Alfred as well as the rest. Please, come back safe.&#12303;</p>

<p>*Gi Gi Gi*</p>

<p>With that scraping sound, the door opened and with a glance back we separated.</p>

<p>This one must be the last trial. Why? Because there were three paintings, the trial should be the last.</p>

<p>After opening the door, we were met by a pure black room and shade which was dark like void.</p>

<p>I felt by body tightening up. As if jumping into a pitch-black hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing...Are you there? Midori, Kai-kun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, right behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me too&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, it&rsquo;s a bit dangerous. I&rsquo;m going to use fire ma---!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as Tanaka-san was going to use fire magic to create a light.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a bright flash, threatening to blind me, lit up the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Something...&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a golden light.</p>

<p>From that light, the previously dark room was lit.</p>

<p>And the same time I heard it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rdquo;UuUOoOO----!!!!&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The atmosphere trembled, and the cries echoed throughout the room.</p>

<p>The yells of the strong directly pleaded to my instincts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the bearer of that voice was not alone, there were countless voices.</p>

<p>Following my instincts, I blocked my ears and to find out what happened, scanned the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M-Monsters!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owners of those voices were monsters.</p>

<p> &quot;What is this...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No way...&quot;</p>

<p>Those monsters were on the other side of golden iron bars.</p>

<p>We were in a long room like a hallway, but we couldn't see the ceiling.</p>

<p> It was like we were on a straight path, just like when Moses parted the sea.</p>

<p>And on both sides of that path, golden iron bars shone and stretched up to the sky.</p>

<p>On the other side, monsters that I had never seen before pounded on the bars, demanding to be let out.</p>

<p>I couldn't tell how many there were, but they seemed like opponents that I couldn't handle whatsoever.</p>

<p>They looked like monsters that only an S-rank adventurer could put up a fight against.</p>

<p>&quot;How many of them are there...&quot;</p>

<p>A swarm of demon beasts that filled my entire field of view, enough to remind me of the word &lsquo;infinite&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Those monsters roared in anger and reached out to us with resentment through the iron bars on both sides.</p>

<p>It was just like they were prisoners.</p>

<p>It was the anger towards the ones who had trapped them here for eternity.</p>

<p>They were trying to eat and kill us.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>I fell on my butt.</p>

<p>I was overwhelmed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Those monsters emit such an aura that it seemed to me even one of them could shake the country.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Is that... an emperor species!? And even red species and dragon species... These monsters are at a pinnacle that I've never seen before... What is this? What the hell is this...?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san was also speechless, standing still.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;AH!?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even Midori-san, who should be strong-willed, screamed at the sound of the monster strongly striking the golden iron bars behind her.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;If all of these things get outside... Japan is finished...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san, an A-class, seems to feel that these monsters have the power to destroy the country.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this country, there are five awakeners called S-class, and even at that level, dealing with this will be extremely difficult.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Is Colonel Alfred also in a similar situation right now?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Colonel Alfred is an S-class, so he is also a monster at that level, but even he can&rsquo;t win alone.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why such a valuable military force as Colonel Alfred was sent here, but the value of an S-class is different between the United States and Japan.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Why? They are the strongest military country in the world.</p>

<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a preciously rare S-Class. Compared to Japan, the US has multiple times more.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even still, the fact that they&rsquo;re rare doesn&rsquo;t change, I think.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san... What are these things?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I don't know either, but it is clear that they&rsquo;re angry with us.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I can feel the sound of my own heartbeat.</p>

<p>This is different from the time with the hobgoblin when I was simply scared.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t on a dimension of not giving up or whether we could win or not.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we were told to fight against something like this, we would only die.</p>

<p></p>

<p>However, this golden iron bar didn&rsquo;t receive any damage from the attacks of those fierce monsters.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What kind of material is it made of?</p>

<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;Look. Over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>As I was wondering that, Midori-san regained her composure and pointed her finger.</p>

<p>There, a golden collar shone on the ground.</p>

<p>A dark ceiling where nothing could be seen was connected by a golden chain.</p>

<p>The golden collar was open so that it could be worn around the neck.</p>

<p></p>

<p> &quot;Are they telling us to wear it? But why only one?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>The moment Tanaka-san touched the collar.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That inorganic mechanical voice echoed throughout the area.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#12302;Choose one sacrifice and have them wear the collar. Time until God&rsquo;s barrier is released, 1000 seconds, 999...&#12303;</p>

<p></p>

<p>At that moment, a golden cube suddenly appeared at the end of the hallway.</p>

<p>The side of the golden cube displayed a scenery of the real world, as if it were a heat haze.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Is that outside!?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>As Tanaka-san shouted, it was a gate.</p>

<p>An exit from the dungeon where we could go outside.</p>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s Shibuya? The scenery outside the Golden Cube was being reflected.</p>

<p>&quot;So, there's the exit, Tanaka-san! We can get out!!&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was filled with joy and ran towards the gate, wondering if I could finally get out.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then, it happened.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It appeared suddenly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Thud.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As if to say, &ldquo;You may not pass.&rdquo; In front of our eyes, golden bars appeared.</p>

<p>Blocking the only road to the gate were bars that looked exactly like the ones sealing in the monsters.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Why...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then we heard the voice again.</p>

<p>That cold and mechanical, system-like voice, commanded to us.</p>

<p>&#12302;Choose one sacrifice and have them put on the collar.&#12303;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I repeated those words in my head and finally made myself understand.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What this trial was trying to make us do.</p>

<p>What it was trying to force us to do.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A feeling of blood draining from my body.</p>

<p>We looked at the monsters again.</p>

<p>They seemed to have understood something, drooling and silently watching us.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I could even feel their impatience to kill.</p>

<p>&quot;No way....&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&quot;Stay behind... alone here...&quot;</p>

<p>We understood.</p>

<p>It was telling us to sacrifice one person among us.</p>

<p>Like a scenario in a death game, where the organizer enjoys watching us kill each other, and decide who's the weakest.</p>

<p>&quot;That's... impossible...&quot;</p>

<p>I sat down on the spot.</p>

<p>I remained sitting there for a while, stunned.</p>

<p>&quot;.... Shit! Shit!!&quot;</p>

<p>Only Tanaka-san, even while knowing it was pointless, still cast spells to burn the golden bars, as well as drew his sword and cut at them.</p>

<p>But the lattice didn't budge.</p>

<p>That was only natural. This wasn't something that could be overcome with brute strength.</p>

<p>That was because this was the power of a God that surpassed human understanding, the same power that sealed the monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;What is this?! What kind of trial is this?!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san's anger was now on full display as he screamed and slashed at the lattice.</p>

<p>Gone was his usual calm demeanor, replaced by pure rage.</p>

<p>&quot;So, in order for the others to survive, we have to leave &lsquo;just&rsquo; a single person as a sacrifice?! This is ridiculous!!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san, in a fit of anger, plunged his sword into the ground and knelt down, exhausted.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;This is ridiculous...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;.... Tanaka-san.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;This is too cruel, what kind of trial is this? We just talked about surviving together, about going out for sushi together...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even Midori-san, who had understood the situation, knelt down and cried.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I feel the same way.</p>

<p>If I knew this was going to happen, I wouldn&rsquo;t have formed a circle and gotten along with them.</p>

<p>If only I hadn't listened to their life stories.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san and Midori-san are good people.</p>

<p>They treated me as an equal, even though I was called garbage.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was honestly happy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It had been almost ten years since I learned that my magic power was only 5, and this was the first time I had ever been recognized like this.</p>

<p>That's why I had come to really like these two people.</p>

<p>Not because of my magic power, but because they looked at me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>They were really kind people who were planning to get married, Midori-san and Tanaka-san.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I imagined that they would make a good couple.</p>

<p> I mean, they were so kind.</p>

<p>And yet, this trial seemed to be designed to select just one person as a sacrifice.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To kill kindness, to kill one person.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So, we couldn't choose, we weren&rsquo;t able do it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even so.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#12302;834, 833...&#12303;</p>

<p></p>

<p>The countdown didn't wait for us.</p>

<p>We would all be killed by the furious, insane monsters if we didn't do something.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even so, we all sat down and couldn't move.</p>

<p>If there had been a villain like Sato, maybe we could have moved.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s no one like that here.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san and Midori-san are sincerely kind people.</p>

<p>That's why we couldn't move.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even so, the countdown mercilessly continued.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Time passed in silence.</p>

<p> &#12302;603, 602, 601, 600...&#12303;</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was when there were less than 10 minutes, 600 seconds left.</p>

<p>When no one could stand up and it had become quiet.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That's when that person stood up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I'll stay behind. Hai-kun, Midori. You guys survive. This is an order as the representative of this mission.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was Tanaka-san.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Isssei! No! No! You can&rsquo;t!!&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Midori-san started crying when she heard that because it meant Tanaka-san would die.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Midori, please become happy. I don't know if there's a better man than me... haha&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san tried to send Midori-san and me off with a dry smile.</p>

<p>Midori-san kept saying she didn't want to, but Tanaka-san shook his head.</p>

<p>But his legs were shaking too. Tanaka-san was human too, of course he was scared.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;...Okay... Issei. Wait a minute...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Midori-san looked at me with both fists clenched.</p>

<p>Her eyes were filled with tears, but they looked determined.</p>

<p>I understood that look.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was the same look as someone who was ready to die for their loved one.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Kai-kun. I'm really sorry. I... choose Isssei. I'm sorry. Hate me. Don't...forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>And with those words, I was sure.</p>

<p>Midori-san would surely choose to let her beloved Tanaka-san survive...</p>

<p></p>

<p>I won't say that choice was wrong.</p>

<p>If Nagi were here and I had the power, I would choose without hesitation to save Nagi.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Because that's what it means to love someone.</p>

<p>To love someone is to make them special.</p>

<p>So, is it wrong to kill someone to help the person you love the most in the world?</p>

<p></p>

<p>I understand Midori-san&rsquo;s feeling of wanting to protect the person she loves, painfully so.</p>

<p> *BAM!*</p>

<p></p>

<p>But then, Tanaka-san hits Midori when he hears that statement.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Midori. No, I'm staying. I&rsquo;m grateful for your feelings, but... this is my responsibility.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Issei! I! I! No! I don't want that!!&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Midori cried in Tanaka's chest.</p>

<p>Tanaka gently hugged her and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>They must be spending their last moments together.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Two people who love each other, torn apart by God's trial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But...</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Ahh, that's right, that's the answer. Nagi.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I won't let that happen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>*Gacha*. &quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I will stay. I'll be taking on the role of the hero.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun?! What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun?! Your collar!&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san hugged Midori-san while I took the collar from his hand and without hesitation put it on myself.</p>

<p>At the same time, the golden bars in the center disappeared with a thud.</p>

<p>I other words, revealing the gate to the outside.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I'm the one with the least value here. I can't tear apart the two people who love each other.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Take it off, Hai-kun!&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I can't. There's a keyhole, but this seems like it won't come off. And that's okay. I liked you guys, even for a short while. I, who was worthless and called trash, was happy that you treated me equally as a person and a friend. Really. Also... look.&quot;</p>

<p> I saw their unstoppable tears.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;For people who cry for me like this, I think it's a pretty good way to use my life.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Because... I said those things.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Midori-san apologizes.</p>

<p>She probably thinks it&rsquo;s her fault.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Don't apologize. The truth is, I was originally planning on dying. I told you earlier when I introduced myself, that I have a sister named Nagi. She's suffering from AMS, but we're poor, and the only place where we can get treatment is at a hospital for clearers. But I can't keep being a clearer... so I'll continue to support her treatment even if it&rsquo;s through the compensation family members receive after clearers die.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I told them what I had decided that day.</p>

<p>The only thing I, who had nothing, could give up in the end to save Nagi was my life.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun... you are...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;So, Tanaka-san, I have one request. Can I ask you to take care of my sister at AMS where I'm hospitalized? I think she can get treatment through survivor compensation, but even if a treatment is found, she won't be able to receive it immediately. Tanaka-san, as the vice-representative of Japan's top guild, you can do something with your power, right? Nagi Amachi. The most important person in the world to me.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I sent Tanaka-san the best smile I could muster.</p>

<p>I pinched my legs with my fingers to hide the trembling.</p>

<p>I was prepared to die, and if it was between failing in clearing the dungeons and having my license be voided, I&rsquo;d rather use my life to provide compensation to my family in order to protect them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>But even so, I was scared.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;...Kai-kun.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Even if I survive here, I can't save my family, so...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I smiled with tears in my eyes, relying on every bit of my strength, and asked Tanaka-san and Midori-san for their help.</p>

<p> &quot;So, I'm counting on you. Please take care of Nagi. I'm begging you. No matter what.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;That was my sincere wish.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;...Ahhh!!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san, immediately after, hits his head hard on the ground and bleeds.</p>

<p>As if he were prostrating himself, he fights with his inner conflict.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Over and over again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then, he lifts his face again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I received that wish, without a doubt...Kai-kun, I swear on my life and the name of our guild that I will take responsibility for your sister until the end. So...please rest assured.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I smile at his response.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;That's great. Actually...I'm lucky to have Tanaka-san's support. Now go, there are only three minutes left.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tanaka-san, despite my poorly made fake smile, accepts it and they both slowly head towards the exit gate.</p>

<p>Their steps are heavy, and they still have conflict, but they keep moving forward step by step.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I mutter as I watch their backs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;This is okay.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is okay.</p>

<p>I keep telling myself that over and over again.</p>

<p>It's better for those two to survive than me, worthless unraked garbage.</p>

<p>Those two who are needed and relied upon by many are better, just by being alive they have more value than I.</p>

<p>Tap tap.</p>

<p></p>

<p>They seem to hesitate, but still move towards the door to the outside step by step.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I stare at their backs while being tied to a collar.</p>

<p>The monsters next to me, countless monsters with bared fangs and drooling, are all looking at me.</p>

<p>Their eyes were creepy, mixed with anger and joy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was truly afraid of the expression that seemed to say, &quot;hurry up and feed us.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>When Tanaka-san and the others crossed the middle point of the straight path, I became completely alone.</p>

<p>At that moment, fear bubbled up inside me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Am I going to die...those fangs look painful...will they tear me apart?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>How will those monsters kill me now?</p>

<p>Will they tear me apart with those huge hands, or pierce me with those huge fangs?</p>

<p>Maybe I'll burn and die from that dragon's breath.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I imagined what kind of death was waiting for me, even though I shouldn't have.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to die...huh?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>The words slipped out of me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t on the dimension of just not giving up or anything like that, this was certain death.</p>

<p>I could stand up to a hobgoblin and I never gave up on a test of knowledge until the end.</p>

<p>But this is different. It's impossible to not give up on this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I don't want this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I truly thought that.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm scared...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Suddenly, I start shaking.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Don't go...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I unconsciously blurt out while looking at Tanaka and the others' backs.</p>

<p>My small voice is drowned out by the noise of the monsters, and Tanaka and the others can't hear me.</p>

<p>But once I say it, I can't stop.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to diee...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm scared and trembling.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tears overflow and won't stop.</p>

<p> Despite this, I desperately try to cover my mouth and curl up, so Tanaka and the others won't notice.</p>

<p>If they see me like this, I feel like they might come back.</p>

<p>So, I try my best to hold back, but the tears won't stop.</p>

<p>When faced with death, I feel like I might lose it.</p>

<p> &quot;Uuuh...I hate thiss...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Tears spill over, and I almost regret this choice.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That's when it happens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As if waiting for my words, a mechanical voice resonates directly in my head.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's as if the voice knew I become like this, and it echoes throughout the area at this timing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#12302;The final trial&#9472;&#9472;&#12303;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>As soon as I hear the voice, golden bars like a prison appear between me and Tanaka and the others.</p>

<p>It's the same iron bars that disappeared earlier, meaning that Tanaka and the others are separated from me.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Although I can't pass through, there's a gap in the golden iron bars that's big enough to see the other side.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And then, another thing happens.</p>

<p> &quot;Hey!?&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>A golden collar appears around Tanaka-san and Midor-san&rsquo;s necks.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's connected to a golden chain that suddenly appears from the sky. They have no way to escape.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;What's happening...&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm confused, but Tanaka and the others head towards the cube that leads outside.</p>

<p>The same thing appears behind me.</p>

<p> And then, another thing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&quot;Two keys...&quot;</p>

<p> Two keys appear in front of me.</p>

<p> It's clear in an instant that these keys are the ones to unlock the collar.</p>

<p>If I use them, I can get out of here.</p>

<p>I understand now; this is the trial.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm being asked again.</p>

<p>To truly feel the reality of death in this situation and to truly not want to die from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>And in this situation where I can save myself if I wish to.</p>

<p> Can I make the same choice again, or... And then I realized.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The mechanical voice hasn't said the name of this trial yet.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&#12302;The final trial&#9472;&#9472;The Trial of the Heart has begun.&#12303;</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>I grasped the key in my hand.</p>

<p>If I use this key, I'll be saved.</p>

<p>Since there are two keys, two of us will be saved.</p>

<p>Another person and I will be saved.</p>

<p>No, I can survive without anyone knowing what happened here if I use the key and take it outside with me.</p>

<p>By killing Tanaka and the others, I can survive.</p>

<p>&quot;I... &quot;</p>

<p>The situation was different from before, and black emotions welled up inside me.</p>

<p>I clenched the key and looked at the chain around my neck.</p>

<p>The countdown was already at less than a minute.</p>

<p>&quot;Haa...Haa...I... I...&quot;</p>

<p>With trembling hands, I approached the key to the keyhole.</p>

<p>I was laughing, I must have been making a terrible expression.</p>

<p>But is that a bad thing? Is it wrong to put one&rsquo;s own life first?</p>

<p>My face twisted, and I felt happiness at the thought that I might survive.</p>

<p>When I get back, I'll take a relaxing bath, spend some of my savings on my favorite gyudon, and eat lots of snacks and juice.</p>

<p>There are still things I want to do, lots of fun things I want to do.</p>

<p>There will surely be a future ahead, so...</p>

<p>That's why, that's why!!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I... will survive! I will survive!&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as I inserted the key into the keyhole and shouted, I remembered.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>&ldquo;I... will survive! I will survive! I&rsquo;m different from this trash!&quot;</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The same words, with the same terrible expression, spoken by someone I despised.</p>

<p>During the Trial of Knowledge, I remembered the face of Sato pushing me. I didn't want to become like him, someone I hate.</p>

<p>And...</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>&#12302;Nagi, I'll definitely save you. Definitely.&#12303;</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>I wanted to become a brother that my little sister could be proud of.</p>

<p>I remembered the words of determination I had said to Nagi at the hospital.</p>

<p>As soon as I did, as if waking up, I felt all my strength leave my body.</p>

<p>I sighed and closed my eyes.</p>

<p>And then...</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>I threw the key toward Tanaka and the others.</p>

<p>Passing through the golden bars, the key flew to their feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Tanaka-san!!&quot;</p>

<p>I said with a smile.</p>

<p>This time with genuine, sincere feelings, not a forced smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Please... Take care of my sister, Nagi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;......Definitely.&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san nodded, and he and the others opened their collars and ran towards the gate and disappeared.</p>

<p>I was the only one left in the room.</p>

<p>Strangely, the fear had disappeared, leaving only the thought that I didn't want to be in pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Haha... How's that, huh? Don't think everything will go your way!!&quot;</p>

<p>I shouted towards the sky, directed to the artificial voice, not knowing if it was able to hear me or not.</p>

<p>Surely, this ending was not the one that the creator of this trial imagined.</p>

<p>I feel a little better now. It must have been created by some kind of God, starting from the selection ceremony of the Knight of God.</p>

<p>The organizer of the death game must always want to see us to fight and betray each other.</p>

<p>But today, regarding this trial alone, they shouldn&rsquo;t have done it that way.</p>

<p>&quot;What a shame! It didn't go as you wanted!! I'll die. With my own will, with my own feelings!! So, this match is...&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;3, 2, 1...&#12303;</p>

<p>I'm going to die anyway, there's no need to flatter this guy.</p>

<p>I won't flatter anyone anymore, I'll live freely.</p>

<p>Even if it's&#12302;God&#12303;.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>I point my middle finger up to the sky.</p>

<p>And I pick a fight with God.</p>

<p>&quot;...I win, you bastard.&quot;</p>

<p>&#12302;0... Time's up. Release.&#12303;</p>

<p>Then the countdown reaches 0 and the golden bars disappear.</p>

<p>The monsters' screams are directed at me, surpassing ten thousand.</p>

<p>I close my eyes and wait for death.</p>

<p>But what I hear is an emotion filled, artificial voice.</p>

<p>&#12302;I found you... a knight to which this can entrusted...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, a feeling of floating attacks me.</p>

<p>I thought I was eaten by the monsters, but I feel no pain.</p>

<p>I open my eyes fearfully, afraid that the surroundings might be full of monsters, but I manage to overcome my fear and open my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>However, when I opened my eyes, I found myself in a strange room.</p>

<p>&#9671;Meanwhile, Colonel Alfred...</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Lieutenant Gillian. This is for the sake of our country, for our survival.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, Colonel! Please help me! I don't want to die!! I have a family!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quiet!! This is an order!! You'll get promoted two ranks and receive a pension for your family. Don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, I don't want to...gufu!?&quot;</p>

<p>Alfred beats up one of his subordinates and forcibly puts a collar on him.</p>

<p>He did it reluctantly because the subordinate resisted.</p>

<p>Alfred, an S-Rank, is no match for Gillian, an A-Rank.</p>

<p>He then walks to the gate with his other subordinate.</p>

<p>The other subordinate is relieved that he wasn't the one chosen.</p>

<p>That's when it happened.</p>

<p>Just like Kai-kun, after passing through the center, the collar bound Colonel Alfred.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey!?&quot;</p>

<p>The key was right in front of Jillian, his subordinate.</p>

<p>&quot;I did it, I did it!! I can survive!!&quot;</p>

<p>But as expected, Jillian used the key on himself.</p>

<p>There was no way he would help Alfred after what he had done to him.</p>

<p>He inserted the key into the lock and opened the collar.</p>

<p>At that moment,</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? The cube...&quot;</p>

<p>The cube that had become the exit to the outside world vanished in an instant, like a mirage.</p>

<p>At the same time, the countdown reached zero, and the golden bars disappeared.</p>

<p>In other words, countless monsters were unleashed.</p>

<p>&quot;Uwaaaahh!!&quot;</p>

<p>Afterwards, they never made it out of the cube.</p>

<p>The United States was later informed by Tanaka that Colonel Alfred and the other nine members were all wiped out.</p>

<p>&#9671;At the same time Outside the cube Tanaka and Midori</p>

<p>&quot;We managed to make it out...&quot;</p>

<p>The next scene Tanaka and Midori saw was Shibuya Scramble Crossing, a familiar sight of modern Japan.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, waahhh!! I'm sorry. I'm sorry!!&quot;</p>

<p>Midori wept, feeling guilty for allowing his death.</p>

<p> &quot;You're amazing. How many people can do the same thing in that situation? The final Trial of the Heart... if it wasn't him...&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka turned around and looked at the cube.</p>

<p>Then the cube turned into particles of light and slowly disappeared.</p>

<p>It disappeared without a trace, not even entering standby mode.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this the end? It's scary to think what would happen if those monsters got out and caused the dungeon to collapse. But thanks to you, this country has been saved. Thank you, sincerely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tanaka continued to bow deeply to the cube.</p>

<p>On that day, the golden cube incident in Shibuya became the biggest damage-causing dungeon conquest in the past few years and was featured in the news daily.</p>

<p>The number of Japanese casualties was 48, including 5 A-Rank, 8 B-Rank, 14 C-Rank, 20 D-Rank, and 1 unranked.</p>

<p>The number of US military casualties was 10, including 1 S-Rank and 9 A-Rank.</p>

<p>However, nothing was gained.</p>

<p>This situation weighed heavily on both the top Japanese guild, Avalon, and the US. The press held them accountable every day.</p>

<p>At one point, there were calls for Tanaka's dismissal, but he declared that he would never resign.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a promise that I must keep, so I cannot abandon this position.&quot;</p>

<p>No one could pursue the matter any further after hearing Tanaka's resolute words.</p>

<p>And after that, there was no more information about the golden cube, leaving a deep scar on Japan, and gradually fading from the public eye.</p>

<p>&#9671; On one side, Kai</p>

<p>&quot;... Huh? Where am I? Did I teleport?&quot;</p>

<p>As if responding to my words, that voice echoes.</p>

<p>&quot;Challenger: Kai Amachi. Clearer of the Trial of the Heart. Therefore, you have become an achiever who has cleared all trials. You have been transferred to the realm of the God and will be given the Eye of God and the Emblem of the Knight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Clear?! With that? And what's the Eye of God? The Emblem of the Knight? What are those?&quot;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised to the point of not being able to believe it, but if the word &quot;clear&quot; is true, then I must have cleared the Trial of the Heart earlier.</p>

<p>If the trial is to not betray my comrades even in the face of death, then it's the lowest kind of trial.</p>

<p>The personality of the one who came up with that idea is twisted.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. But is that really the correct answer... And where is this? Normally you should be teleported outside.&quot;</p>

<p>I look around.</p>

<p>It was a dimly lit room illuminated by blue torches.</p>

<p>According to surroundings it feels like the throne room that appears in games.</p>

<p>In front of me was a magnificent throne and a skeleton sitting on it, it&rsquo;s head hanging.</p>

<p>&quot;It's creepy... And... are those wings? &quot;</p>

<p>The skeleton was just like a human.</p>

<p>The only difference was that it had wings, though they were just bones.</p>

<p> It was like the skeleton of an angel, or maybe a demon.</p>

<p>The skeleton just sat on the throne, hanging its head.</p>

<p>Beside it were two pedestals.</p>

<p>One was an empty pedestal with nothing on it.</p>

<p>There must have been something on it, but now it stands quietly with nothing.</p>

<p>The other was enveloped in a column of golden light.</p>

<p>In that light were two things.</p>

<p>One was a tag engraved with a name like a golden pendant. It looked like something a soldier would wear around their neck.</p>

<p>And the other was...</p>

<p>&quot;Is this... the Eye of God from that mural? It looks expensive. Is it made of pure gold...?&quot;</p>

<p>A fist-sized, golden triangle that shone brightly.</p>

<p>On its side was an eye mark.</p>

<p>It was the Eye of Providence that was drawn in that mural, God&rsquo;s omnipotent eye itself.</p>

<p>Maybe that painting was representing this.</p>

<p>And in front of that pedestal was a stone monument.</p>

<p>&quot;Is this a monument? I wonder what it is... I can't read it well... It's broken, and it's not in Japanese... Huh? I can read it, I can read it!&quot;</p>

<p>The moment I touched the stone monument, I could sense the characters written in some language that I couldn't understand.</p>

<p>I then tried reading the first line.</p>

<p>&quot;We... were defeated?&quot;</p>

<p>Although I could read the beginning, the words were completely incomprehensible.</p>
