<p><h2>Chapter 4: Lune Ruschia Magic School</h2></p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4>
  
  <p><i>Clang clang...clang clang&#8230;<i></p>

<p>It was spring.</p>

<p>The green wheat fields, ready for the summer harvest, flowed endlessly outside the train window.</p>

<p>In a warm region like the Kingdom of Ruschia, olives, wheat, grapes, oranges, and lemons bore fruit abundantly. One realizes the fact that most of the areas outside the cities were agricultural when traveling on a long-distance train.</p>

<p>A year and a half had passed since that night the stars fell.</p>

<p>I, Makia O&rsquo;Drielle, was now fifteen years old.</p>

<p>Now I was riding a magical train with a trunk and my magic basket.</p>

<p>It was for enrolling in Lune Ruschia Magic School, which I passed the exams for.</p>

<p>As I nodded off, an area where almond trees were in full bloom crossed my sight from time to time. Every time, my chest buzzed quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almond flowers...are a bit similar to Japan&rsquo;s sakura flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Japan. That was the country where I lived in my past life.</p>

<p>...I&rsquo;m sorry, past life me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll apologize here for how even though I&rsquo;ve dreamed about you many times as a child, I didn&rsquo;t realize that it was my past life at all and continued to make fun of you for being a cowardly and dull girl.</p>

<p>&#12295;</p>

<p>This was after Thor was gone.</p>

<p>I was so lonely that I became emotionally unstable, sulking, raging at every little thing, running around, and sobbing.</p>

<p>At that time, the duke&rsquo;s daughter Sumilda Bigreitz, who became Thor&rsquo;s younger sister on paper, said to me,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since magic school is in the capital, maybe you&rsquo;ll unexpectedly bump into Big Brother Thor somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was absolutely right, I thought, and I studied hard to prepare for the magic school&rsquo;s entrance exam. Thank you, Sumilda.</p>

<p>I had been working hard on magic until then, but with a defined goal, I became desperate as though I was being possessed by something. It was to the point where even my noninterfering parents were worried about my health.</p>

<p>Apparently, after Thor was summoned to the capital, he was immediately made to join the royal knights in order to train him into being an excellent Guardian.</p>

<p>That was why, if I went to the capital, I might be able to meet Thor somewhere.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen or heard from him since then. But I think I had to see him again.</p>

<p>I had thought several times that my dreams and the scenes I saw on the night of the meteor shower were of my past life.</p>

<p>So many things happened that day that I was confused and couldn&rsquo;t ponder upon it right away, but I recovered my memories day by day and I was now sure that those were from my past life.</p>

<p>If that was the case, then maybe it wasn&rsquo;t just me, but also Thor who was the reincarnation of my crush who died at that time&#8230;</p>

<p>This was something like intuition, there was no certainty.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think Thor and that boy&rsquo;s face and personality were that similar just because I unconsciously gave him the same name.</p>

<p>That night, Thor didn&rsquo;t seem to have recalled his past life&rsquo;s memories, rather, he was chosen as a Guardian, so it wasn&rsquo;t the time for that&#8230;</p>

<p>If I could see Thor next time, I had to confirm the past life stuff somehow.</p>

<p>In the end, I didn&rsquo;t really care if Thor was or wasn&rsquo;t my crush in my past life.</p>

<p>I just wanted to the truth of the feelings I thought I had for Thor on that day.</p>

<p>Because, you know?</p>

<p>Maybe these were false feelings of love that were my lingering affections from my past life?</p>

<p>If this was a mistaken love that was dragged out from my past life feelings, then I must shake it off.</p>

<p>But, if I was convinced that these were definite feelings I had for Thor, then I had to tell him next time. Even if nothing changed upon telling him.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t move forward if I didn&rsquo;t do at least that.</p>

<p>And I couldn&rsquo;t give up on Thor&#8230;</p>

<p>Just because I remembered my past life, it didn&rsquo;t mean I wasn&rsquo;t already colored by the personality of Makia O&rsquo;Drielle, and as Makia, I had to find out the answer for these feelings.</p>

<p>However, I was the only one who knew about the past life me. I respected her like a &ldquo;mind neighbor,&rdquo; and gratefully borrowed her memories and knowledge.</p>

<p>If there was any meaning to these memories, then it was without a doubt a &ldquo;warning&rdquo; for me.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;The blond man who killed us.</p>

<p>Now I could remember his face and words vividly.</p>

<p>And that was exactly why I knew now.</p>

<p>I was sure that man said &ldquo;Maydare&rdquo; to me. Was it possible that he crossed over into that world from this one and killed us?</p>

<p>Along with the legend of the Savior, it was certain that there was another world.</p>

<p>And the means to connect this world with the other world was &ldquo;magic.&rdquo; It was likely the extension of transference magic and summoning magic. That was tremendously difficult magic, but not impossible.</p>

<p>If that blond man knew that technique...There was a good chance that he was now back in Maydare.</p>

<p>If that was the case, then I must be on guard from now on.</p>

<p>That man had said something very important.</p>

<p> &ldquo;No matter how many times you&rsquo;re reborn, I will kill you without fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&#12295;</p>

<p>Clang clang...clang clang&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Staring absentmindedly at the outside scenery through the train window, lost in my thoughts, the old parchment recipe book on my lap fell to the ground.</p>

<p>I picked it up, already shifting my attention to reality.</p>

<p>This was something Grandmother gave me before I left Deliafield.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know who wrote it or when, but I remembered Grandmother telling me to make sure I mastered the recipes written in this book. And then, she told me to bring the magic basket that was a favorite of the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch&rdquo; to school.</p>

<p>I was feeling hungry right then, so I opened the basket and took out a salt apple, and as I bit into it, I turned the pages of the old parchment recipe book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even children who hate vegetables love salt apples with grated carrots. Salt apple juice regulates the circulation of magical power, so it should be drunk every day. Pork beans with salt apples and honey is a taste that will take any man captive...Hmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pages that collected salt apple recipes were naturally all about the magical cooking of salt apples. Each and every one of them was mastered by Grandmother and Mother, and I ate them often.</p>

<p>To sum it up, these were recipes that the witches who were born or married into the O&rsquo;Drielle family were supposed to learn, and now it was my turn to inherit them.</p>

<p>The basics of magical cooking were drilled into me by Mother, so now it was time to master them while I was a student. The only thing I brought in the magic basket was plenty of salt apples.</p>

<p>Father had work, and Mother didn&rsquo;t want to leave the house, so I headed to the royal capital Miladriede by myself. My uncle on my mother&rsquo;s side was arranged to pick me up there.</p>

<p>Even so, this was my first train ride since I was reborn in this world.</p>

<p>Unlike the ones I rode in my past life, I was in a private compartment which I shared with strangers who came in one after another, but it also had a certain charm. There were means to get to the capital such as by ship or airship or other ways, but I chose the comfortable train ride even if it took longer.</p>

<p>One wouldn&rsquo;t know by being in Deliafield, but because the Kingdom of Ruschia was a great magical power, the magical industry thrived and there were various types of transportation.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Royal capital Miladriede, royal capital Miladriede.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oh, we&rsquo;ve arrived. I brought my trunk down from the roof rack and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>My new life would begin today. I breathed in, filling my chest with anticipation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello and welcome, my adorable niece Miss Makia. It&rsquo;s been a year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? You&rsquo;re the same as ever, Uncle Medite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one who was waiting at the station for me was Mother&rsquo;s younger brother, Sir Urbanus Medite. His deep green hair and snake-like eyes were just like Mother&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He was wearing a dark brown robe with a long hem and a large hat of the same color, along with his characteristic shady-looking monocle. He was twenty-eight years old this year, I believe. He was a professor at the Lune Ruschia Royal Magic School, single, adored me, his niece, and a weird uncle who was always grinning.</p>

<p>Incidentally, in the past Uncle charged in unannounced and got caught in a pitfall trap Thor and I set up in front of the mansion&rsquo;s entrance as a measure against suspicious persons, and broke his bones.</p>

<p>Well, he was a pro at potions, so he effortlessly healed himself with his own medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting prettier and prettier every day, and you&rsquo;ve gotten a lot taller. You&rsquo;re completely a grown-up lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That might be thanks to my high heels. But I have grown five centimeters this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plenty amazing. You used to be so small.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I was that small&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I retorted back at Uncle who was blatantly showing a low position&#8230;</p>

<p>But, it was true. Not long ago, I was petite and scrawny, with a child-like face and figure.</p>

<p>However, after Thor was gone, there was a time where I buried myself in studying for exams so much that I even forgot to eat, and I looked haggard.</p>

<p>My cheeks were hollow, and my skin, hair, and lips were all rough and neglected. When I looked at myself in my big mirror, I felt a violent shock when I saw that the red crystal earrings Thor gave me no longer suited me at all.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t go on like this.</p>

<p>Thinking that, in order to get back on my feet, I ate a lot of healthy vegetables and meat, and I also drank a lot of milk. As a change of pace, I had Mother teach me to make magical dishes and I would make them myself.</p>

<p>Most importantly, to regain my strength, I worked out in the heathland and the Salt Forest. I asked our old knight, Godwin, to train me and build up my strength. And then, I was able to give everything I had into studying for exams, which was nothing but good, so I wish I had done those things earlier.</p>

<p>I think the air about me had changed a little bit in just this past year, coinciding with my growing period.</p>

<p>Thanks to growing taller, my figure had become slender and more mature, and even my cutting board-like chest had swelled out in a feminine way.</p>

<p>My chin and the base of my throat became slightly thinner, and I still had girlish features, but there was no longer a childish feel to them. I properly learned how to put on makeup before going to magic school, and I was now carefully looking after my hair and skin. I even got used to wearing the high heeled shoes I hated.</p>

<p>Well, I was already a peerless beauty from the beginning, but I polished my beauty even more.</p>

<p>Because, when I met Thor again one day, I wanted to be someone who looked the best in the earrings he gave me.</p>

<p>You were surprisingly a crybaby, Makia O&rsquo;Drielle.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because I cried my lifetime&rsquo;s worth of tears after Thor was gone, or because the amount of information within me increased after I recalled my past life, or because I simply grew up.</p>

<p>After that, I never cried again.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4>

<p>Royal capital Miladriede.</p>

<p>It was a &ldquo;city of water&rdquo; on the southernmost coastal area of Ruschia, with many aquatic magic boats coming and going on the canals and waterways that ran through the city in all directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s Miladriede Castle? It&rsquo;s a lot more majestic than it looks in pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We also boarded a boat that took us along the central canal, where we could lay our eyes on the royal castle beautifully.</p>

<p>The castle, surrounded by waterways and ten crystal pillars, was the center of Miladriede.</p>

<p>It is characterized by its pure white walls and roofs that were of a blue called Miladriede blue. The ornaments that looked like several golden crowns placed on top were dazzling, and my girlish imagination was aroused, thinking that the inside must be full of luxurious rooms, and wondering how they held balls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey hey, Miss Makia. If you lean out too far, you&rsquo;ll fall. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of tourists falling into the river here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle, sitting all the opposite side, said as he puffed on his tobacco pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle, have you gone to the castle before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. I seldom see Thor, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor was living in that palace. With the girl who fell from another world, and his comrades who were connected by the Crests of the Four Lights. I wonder if he had already become a city boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, just forget about that shitty brat, Miss Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle, you&rsquo;ve always been hostile to Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I hate horrid little brats with talent and good looks. When I came to bring a surprise present for you once, he made me break my bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was an accomplice to that as well. We never thought that you would fall into the pit we created as a way to practice magic. Oh, look, Uncle. A cute lemon tree. There&rsquo;s a lemon candy shop too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boats traveling along the waterways continued to entertain the streets of Miladriede.</p>

<p>The surrounding islands were known for their lemon cultivation, and there were many shops selling sweets, food, and other goods made from lemons standing side by side.</p>

<p>When we headed towards the bustling heart of the city, there were street performers playing music and showcasing their art.</p>

<p>The apartments were stylish, with their white walls and Miladriede blue roofs and window frames. Stained-glass magical streetlamps lined the milk-white brick roads, and there were ladies dressed in trendy puff-sleeved clothes and gentlemen in suits.</p>

<p>The galleria, with its distinctive arched glass roof, was a sight to behold. It was a famous shopping district and tourist attraction, but it also had a waterway on which aquatic magic boats traveled. I think I looked up at the glass ceiling with my mouth wide open.</p>

<p>When we left the city center and headed south, I felt that the scenery had changed a little.</p>

<p>Private houses lined the waterfront, freely colored in reds, blues, greens, and yellows. Lemon trees, orange trees, and olive trees hung down by the road, their beautiful green leaves bathed in plenty of sunlight, and their fruits like gemstones. Women and men in ordinary dress were going about their business, and children were playing happily. Some magic tools seemed to have taken root among ordinary people, as they were cutting down trees with shears whose handles could be extended freely, using carriers that moved with magic, and it seemed that colored balls that returned to you no matter where you threw them were popular among children.</p>

<p>The royal capital Miladriede, where historic and modern buildings, as well as culture and magic that took root in daily life, came together. The lively activities of the people were interesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I&rsquo;m going to like this town, Uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great to hear. Then, how about the school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boat passed under a large bridge, and when it came out from there, I smelled the scent of sea water.</p>

<p>My field of vision brightened even more, and the blue sky and blue sea jumped into view. And then,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Lune Ruschia Royal Magic School.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p>A land-tied island connected to the coast of Miladriede by a long bridge.</p>

<p>Floating above the blue sea, it was more like a huge castle than an island, or like a fortress.</p>

<p>The majestic buildings that clung to the steep slopes and piled up high were a collection of architectural styles from various eras, and a long and narrow crystal lighthouse extended out from the top. At the top of it was a round magical crystal called a lacrima, which was emitting a strange frizzy light even in this daytime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow&#8230;! It&rsquo;s the most prestigious magic school in the world, Lune Ruschia Magic School!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the place I've always been longing for. I was more moved than when I saw Miladriede Castle earlier, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but applaud.</p>

<p>After getting off the aquatic magic boat, we walked across the long bridge that led to the island and headed for the magic school on the sea.</p>

<p>A huge statue of a goat and verdant trees ladened with lemons, as expected, sat quietly in front of the school&rsquo;s imposing gate. Keeping my nerves in check, I now made my way to the school grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lune Ruschia Magic School is like a small-scale town, and classes are held in all the facilities on the island. There are cathedrals, lecture halls, student dorms, research facilities, countless ateliers, living quarters for teachers and staff, several dining halls and stands, stores specializing in magical tools for classroom use, and even a small souvenir shop. If you get the school&rsquo;s permission, even students can open their own stores here. Also, you can take as many lemons that grow here as you want. The lemon trees have sharp thorns, so be careful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot freer here than I thought it&rsquo;d be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, magicians are basically the do-as-you-please types. However, there are many situations where you are responsible for your own actions, and even if you&rsquo;re a student, the school can&rsquo;t always protect you. This is that sort of place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes. I don&rsquo;t dislike that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the gaps between the old buildings piled up on top of each other, the soft light of early afternoon shined through.</p>

<p>I felt a strange throbbing in my chest, like I had wandered into an unknown world.</p>

<p>The fragrance of ripened lemons all throughout the school would become the scent that would nestle up close to my daily life from now on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I went up the milk-white brick stairs, I saw an old fountain in a place that looked like a central square.</p>

<p>There was a boy quietly staring up at that fountain.</p>

<p>He had platinum blond hair and was wearing an old suit that was slightly too big on him.</p>

<p>I wondered if he was a student at this school. There was a very strange air about him, and when I followed him with a side glance, I thought our eyes met for an instant between the bands of water emitted from the fountain.</p>

<p>The color of his eyes, a vivid magenta like purple and red mixed together, were very rare...</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Makia, over here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Called by Uncle, I climbed to an even higher place.</p>

<p>From here, I could see the azure sky and the turquoise blue sea, the streets of Miladriede, and the other island dotted around. As well as the terraced lemon tree groves spread out on the cliffs of the island. There were seabirds flying too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girls&rsquo; dorm is over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; dorms were naturally separated, and the girls&rsquo; dorm was surrounded by a huge, easily recognizable wall. It almost made you wonder if this was the real fortress.</p>

<p>Uncle reached into his pocket for something and then handed it to me.</p>

<p>It was the student handbook for Lune Ruschia Royal Magic School.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one last thing, Miss Makia. Call me &lsquo;Professor Medite&rsquo; in school, not Uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. ...Then, Professor Medite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay! I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to the day when you&rsquo;d call me by that. Look forward to Potions class, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>From now on, I would learn many things from Professor Medite, not Uncle. I felt somewhat complicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, Miss Makia. I&rsquo;m usually in my personal atelier in Building 5, so feel free to come by if you need anything. Like if there&rsquo;s anything you don&rsquo;t know, or if you don&rsquo;t like the girl you&rsquo;re sharing your room with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sharing my room!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you know? It&rsquo;s generally two people to a room here. You have a roommate too, Miss Makia. If I remember correctly, err&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got it! I&rsquo;ll go confirm it for myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unable to contain myself any longer, I passed under the imposing door to the girls&rsquo; dorm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Medite, let us meet in class next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, I looked for my room while checking the number on my admission form.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4>

<p>Girls&rsquo; Dorm Room 2020. I stood in front of an old-looking, white-painted wooden door.</p>

<p>The room number was written on an antique black doorplate, and there was a piece of paper with names written on it next to the door. Below my name,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lapis Twilight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An unusual name that was not heard often was written. I smoothed my hair slightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First impressions are important, first impressions are important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Muttering that like an incantation, I entered the room.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t make a good first impression anyway, so I did my best to put on an amiable smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pure white walls and an oak floor. There was no one in the room, which only had a desk and chairs made of the same oak wood and an old-fashioned magical lamp in the center of it, even though the windows were left open.</p>

<p>The yellow setting sun shined through the swaying light blue curtains. There was a wide balcony that formed a semicircle, and I was a little happy. There were an olive tree and a potted mint plant on the balcony. If it was this wide, I could grow many other things as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard a strange creaking metallic sound in the neighboring room. It seemed to be the bedroom, so I peeked in.</p>

<p>There were two beds. A girl was standing between them.</p>

<p>She seemed to have opened the window just then, as her long black hair flowed in the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was almost dusk. It smelled like that.</p>

<p>My best smile turned into a look of surprise in an instant.</p>

<p>When she glanced over at me, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think that she somewhat looked like Thor as I was pierced by her deep dark-purple eyes.</p>

<p>Her eyes weren&rsquo;t a brilliant violet color like Thor&rsquo;s, but she had black hair and her overall appearance had a close resemblance to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl greeted me in a hushed voice, like she was whispering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-hello!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also returned the greeting with my trunk in hand.</p>

<p>Upon closer inspection, I saw that she was wearing a long black dress with sleeves even on such a warm day.</p>

<p>Her waist-length black hair was in a loose braid, and when she walked, the hair at her sides that spilled out brushed against her white skin, making her even more mysterious and beautiful. However, I found it strange how every time she stepped on the floor, there was a creaking metallic sound like I heard earlier. Was she wearing metal shoes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Lapis Twilight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, I&rsquo;m Makia O&rsquo;Drielle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was strangely nervous. When I held out my hand, she widened her eyes slightly and slowly grasped my hand, looking somewhat bewildered.</p>

<p>Her hand was strangely cold. And it was trembling.</p>

<p>She was very calm as far as exchanging words went, but maybe she was nervous too?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you from? I&rsquo;m from Deliafield.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I...am from the Frezier Empire. I&rsquo;m a foreign student.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, Frezier!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frezier Empire was a large country in the west, and it was a close ally of Ruschia.</p>

<p>It was a prosperous military state that had lots of flying battleships and the like. If I remember correctly, they had a young queen governing the country in lieu of its king, who was bedridden from illness.</p>

<p>&rdquo;I knew someone who looks like you. He has the same black hair and purple eyes, and he was also from Frezier. Are those common there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Someone who looks like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl tilted her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so. That&rsquo;s a very interesting story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a small smile with her adult-like eyes. Right at that moment, a young black cat slipped by her feet. &ldquo;Wah!&rdquo; I jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he surprise you? I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s, who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is my familiar, a night cat. His name is Noah. He&rsquo;s a very good kitty. His spirit element is&#12304;Darkness&#12305;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way, you&rsquo;re already using spirits!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. It is necessary for the family business, so I know how to summon spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At magic school, it was customary to summon your own familiar spirit in the first class, but this girl had already learned that art and had a spirit accompanying her. ...Amazing!</p>

<p>Noah the night cat also had light purple eyes with a gray tinge, and he settled down at Lapis&rsquo; feet with a composed expression. Their species were different, but their overall coloration was the same, and they looked like brother and sister.</p>

<p>Lapis picked up Noah and showed me his face.</p>

<p>When I stroked his glossy fur and stroked his chin, he squinted his eyes in pleasure. He was really cute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many of the Twilight clan&rsquo;s familiars are cats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say familiars are strongly drawn to the blood of a family. My father has a crow, and my mother has a snake. That&rsquo;s why I think I&rsquo;ll probably get a crow or snake too, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, there&rsquo;s also the possibility that it could be completely different. I didn't know what spirit would come to me, but I wanted to summon and use a familiar as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Whether it was a snake or crow, I&rsquo;ll fully love any spirit that came to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised at being called by my name so naturally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been told to go pick up my uniform today. Shall we go together, Makia? It seems like the dorm leader is handing them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something nostalgic about this feeling of leading a school life with a classmate.</p>

<p>Even in my past life, I had a school friend. We were very close and always together, but in the end, we liked the same person, and I had complicated feelings.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">4</h4>

<p>  &ldquo;Miss Makia O&rsquo;Drielle and Miss Lapis Twilight of Room 2020, I see. Oh, I&rsquo;m the fourth-year girls&rsquo; dorm leader, Nagie Medite. I&rsquo;m sure Miss Makia knows me, but nice to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The easy-going girls&rsquo; dorm leader with her deep green hair gathered back handed us our uniforms in our requested sizes while checking off our names on some kind of form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time, Cousin Nagie. I guess I should call you Senior Nagie here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although we&rsquo;re cousins, I&rsquo;m also the dorm leader here, you know~. Please show me some respect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;m in your care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Respecting the hierarchical relationships here, I greeted her with a straight back.</p>

<p>In actuality, Cousin Nagie was the daughter of Mother&rsquo;s older brother, who was the head of House Medite, and my cousin. We have met several times before.</p>

<p>The Medite family was a prestigious family of magicians with its head house in the royal capital, and they also sat on the board of directors of Lune Ruschia Magic School, which apparently held great power in this school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Lapis is a foreign student, right? Welcome all the way here to Lune Ruschia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis elegantly bowed her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have any problems in the girls&rsquo; dorm, you can always come to me. We girls have a lot to deal with, especially since we&rsquo;re all witches in training. And the professors aren&rsquo;t going to help us no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in short, good luck, freshmen. Ahaha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senior Nagie&rsquo;s bright smile was loaded with meaning. What exactly was in store for us from now on&#8230;</p>

<p>We returned to our room and immediately opened the wrapping paper for our uniforms.</p>

<p>The Lune Ruschia Magic School uniform was classic, consisting of a white blouse, a long deep blue skirt, and a deep blue hooded robe, but the ribbon on the chest represented the color of one&rsquo;s school year and it was traditionally named after a gemstone.</p>

<p>We first-years were red. Therefore, we were called Garnet first-years.</p>

<p>By the way, second-years were blue and Tanzanites, third-years were green and Peridots, and fourth-years were yellow and Citrines. When you graduate, that color was passed on to the next first-years, but only the graduate students, also known as fifth-years, were fixed as purple Amethysts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Lapis. I&rsquo;ve heard about it, but these uniforms really are cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis replied somewhat halfheartedly. Does she not like them? I wondered, and when I looked at her, I saw that she looked a lot paler than she ever had before, and there was sweat beading on her forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not feeling well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She staggered as she tried to head towards the bathroom, but I supported her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m still not used to Ruschia&rsquo;s warm climate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Lapis said that, she put her hand on the washroom&rsquo;s door knob, but it weakly slipped off so she quickly held her own arm. I felt a strange flow of magical power coming from there.</p>

<p>Feeling like something was out of place, I recalled the moment I touched Lapis&rsquo; hand just now.</p>

<p>It was awfully cold, and shaking. I had thought she was nervous, but&#8230;</p>

<p>She slowly sank down on the spot. It was as if she had lost strength in every part of her body. I sat down beside her to support her and rolled up her black sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, I slowly widened my eyes. Astonishingly, her right arm was a magical prosthetic hand.</p>

<p>It seemed to be equipped with the ability to mimic a normal arm, but that had come undone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry...Makia. I didn&rsquo;t mean to scare you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis seemed to be in a lot of pain. I didn&rsquo;t know much about these kinds of tools, but I could feel the flow of magical power when I held my hand over it, and I felt that a problem had occurred with the circulation of magical power where the magical prosthetic and skin joined together. That was probably why the prosthetic stopped working.</p>

<p>One of her legs, which could be seen from her skirt, seemed to also be a prosthetic. Was that the reason why there was a creaking sound when she walked?</p>

<p>&ldquo;These magical prosthetics have the latest technology in Frezier, &lsquo;magical circuitry,&rsquo; wired through them, and it is extraordinary. However, since it is in tune with the body, I will become lethargic if the magical power is not circulating properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s...something like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her trembling hands might have also been because she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well to begin with.</p>

<p>I wondered what happened to her that caused her to have an artificial hand and leg.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask about it, but I held back that question for now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that Ruschia is filled with ancient magic, and it disturbs the magical circulation of people who come here from other countries. Let&rsquo;s have you lie down on a bed first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to hold Lapis up, but her magical prostheses that wouldn&rsquo;t activate were very heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, please don&rsquo;t strain yourself. They are made from a special metal, so they are extremely heavy. I&rsquo;ll crawl there&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, it&rsquo;s fine. This is what levitation magic is for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cast levitation magic on Lapis. I still couldn&rsquo;t use enough magic to make her float, but I could reduce her weight by doing this. Thank goodness I learned it from Thor.</p>

<p>Carrying a listless Lapis on my back with a &ldquo;Heave ho,&rdquo; I took her to a bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call a teacher. Just wait a little bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for that! I&rsquo;ll be back to normal if I just sleep a little and get used to this climate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it that...you don&rsquo;t really want people to know about them? Those magical prostheses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded, perhaps because there was some sort of reason. Actually, it would be better to show them to a doctor, but&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got it. Then, let&rsquo;s take off your clothes. It&rsquo;ll make it a bit more comfortable for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While helping Lapis, who couldn&rsquo;t move her hands and feet freely, I took off her shoes and black dress and laid her on the bed.</p>

<p>Magical power circulated through the body like blood, and it was the driving force behind the usage of magic.</p>

<p>A disturbance in the circulation of magical power in the body was a common occurrence in the children of magicians, and it was also likely to occur when one is exposed to the magical power of unfamiliar places, as Lapis was. One is stricken with headaches and nausea, and you also became unable to use magic well. When it becomes like that, in Lapis&rsquo; case, she wouldn&rsquo;t be able to move her magical prostheses well.</p>

<p>I also had disturbances in my magical power circulation several times when I was little.</p>

<p>I remembered that at times like those, I always drank salt apple juice. Salt apples had the effect of purifying the magical power within your body and regulating the flow. Most importantly, it made you feel refreshed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought salt apples picked from the Salt Forest, so I&rsquo;ll make you some juice. Just wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I left the bedroom and quickly opened the magic basket I brought with me.</p>

<p>I took out a salt apple, the recipe book I received from Grandmother, and honey, and also got ready the lemon I plucked when I came to this room and a glass that was in the room.</p>

<p>There was a simple kitchen in our room, and it was there I opened the recipe book to the page for salt apple juice and quickly set about making it.</p>

<p>First, I used&#12304;Wind&#12305;magic to enclose the salt apple in a small sphere of wind where I chopped it up and stirred it. This was also a magic Thor used often, and it was very useful.</p>

<p>I raised the glass to the side of the wind sphere and the murky salt apple juice made a nice tinkling sound as it poured out. I added a spoonful of honey with a silver spoon, and squeezed out lemon juice and mixed it in.</p>

<p>And finally, I touched the rim of the glass with my ringed fingertip and chanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mel vis makia...Magic, swirl. Like blood the color of apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second incantation was the incantation that was written in the book. Incantations for magical cooking were said to be more effective if they were carefully chanted and included the name of the ingredient.</p>

<p>Lastly, I borrowed a leaf from the mint plant on the balcony, added it to the salt apple juice, and took it to the bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made the salt apple juice. It&rsquo;s one of the recipes of the O&rsquo;Drielle house&rsquo;s witches. Just take your time. Take a sip first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I helped Lapis get up and gave her the glass.</p>

<p>She took the glass with her left hand, not the right hand that couldn&rsquo;t move, and tried to take a sip.</p>

<p>The salt apple juice in the glass was murky and thick, and I thought that it had a very strong taste.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has a strange taste. It&rsquo;s not only sweet, but also faintly salty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis took a sip and exhaled in relief after removing her lips from the glass. She drank it several more times, and she seemed to be gradually settling down, as her color improved. The circulation of her magical power seemed to have normalized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it seems to be working. It would be sad if you weren&rsquo;t able to go to the entrance ceremony tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230; Do you find me disgusting? With such a machine-like body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Disgusting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I blinked several times at this unexpected question. And then I looked at Lapis&rsquo; arm and foot one more time.</p>

<p>They were peeking out from the blanket. A magical prosthetic hand and leg made of metal&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Do they transform or something like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was decisively told that. Well, I guess they didn&rsquo;t, then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought you were disgusting. I am curious about how your body got that way, but...I won&rsquo;t pry at it. Witches are accomplished in the art of secrecy. It&rsquo;s a form of magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put my finger to my mouth and smiled with a wink.</p>

<p>Lapis&rsquo; expression barely changed, but,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you...very much. Um, I might cause you some more trouble in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drank the rest of the salt apple juice and stared at the glass as she said that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mm, it&rsquo;s okay. Actually, you might also have a lot of trouble coming your way due to sharing a room with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I smiled brightly and put my hand to my chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, I am a magician of the infamous O&rsquo;Drielle house. The O&rsquo;Drielle house are the descendants of the worst witch in the world. Well, I&rsquo;m very proud of that, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis raised her face and intently stared at me, who boldly declared that, with her dark purple eyes.</p>

<p>Eyes the color of twilight, the color a bit before night, that seemed to suck me in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and me are a bit alike, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take pride in your birth without the least bit of shame. I am the same. Even if it means losing my hands and legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would be a little while before I learn the meaning of her words.</p>
