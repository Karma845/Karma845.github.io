<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Saturday, the next day. The day after Tachibana gave the nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, nothing happened after that. The rumors had now vanished without a trace, and I was able to get my normal days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My calm days… Welcome back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go to eat something delicious to celebrate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I should go eat at kaiten-zushi as a luxury.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a famous chain store quite near to my house, right in front of the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is quite crowded because it is lunchtime as well as a holiday, but it does not really matter to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kaitori-Zushi&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a place that most common people avoid is quite common for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, you don’t have to come with a companion to eat delicious food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you sit at the counter, you will have to wait less and see all the good things to try.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down at the very end of the counter where I was immediately guided and given brewed hot tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was lucky, as the seat next to me was vacant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t take off my hat even in a store because I like it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not worried about how it looks in public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s my favorite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed a plate of tuna sushi that was passed to me. I add the soy sauce and quickly eat it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sushi is delicious as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s so delicious and it costs 100 yen. You can’t really say Kaiten-Zushi is too expensive after tasting it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I finished with my second plate, a customer finally arrived in the seat next to mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever there is a person next to me, I also feel a bit uncomfortable.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might as well be the only drawback of the counter seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it should be given that sitting alone in a big place is much more uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tilt your body slightly on the wall to secure your personal space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a quick peek, the customer next to me seemed to be a young girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe even a student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visiting Kaiten-Zushi, a young girl, and alone too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just who is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, It’s Kusuba-san?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Let it be my imagination,” I whispered to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not my imagination, rather, it was Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looked down at me with a face I couldn’t tell what she was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: She was standing.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was wearing simple casual clothing, with no frills. An appearance that was different from the usual school uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long green skirt and a simple white top were too beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana in casual clothes was much more beautiful compared to in school uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just why…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was supposed to be a celebration of coming back to my everyday life.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why are you here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…? To eat sushi of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Why are you alone. It’s rare for a girl to go and eat outside by herself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you need a companion to eat something? And, even you are alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could not refute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary, what Tachibana said was exactly the same as my thoughts.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana nimbly sat down next to me and started to sip her tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strangely, those actions suited me, so I started to involuntarily stare at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;… what is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm…? Oh, nothing”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn, I shouldn’t have come to eat here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana took a plate of sushi and started to eat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expressions on her face relaxed, and the small, chewing mouth smiled faintly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like Tachibana was really looking forward to eating sushi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn&#8217;t seem to care about the people around her, rather happily eats her sushi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like my views in life were right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you are right, you are happy to see the proof in others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: His views in life, as in previous chapters, were being displayed by Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it’s a common thought process, I can&#8217;t help but think that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you not eating anymore?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…? Ah… I am.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I take the sushi plate in front of me and start eating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then look at Tachibana and say,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry for what? What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I heard a lot of rumors regarding us. It brought you unwanted attention.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes… now you mention it, there were such rumors.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s why… I’m sorry.” </span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something I had been worried about in the back of my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think Tachibana’s image was scarred because of a background mob-like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I interacted with too much in the open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had thought I would apologize to her if I ever had the opportunity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s quite alright, there is no need for you to apologize,&#8221; she said. “Anyway, the people who should apologize are the ones who started the rumor, it is not Kusuba-san’s fault.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah… That’s right, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Besides, I do not care about the rumors. They have just been created from curiosity and jealousy. I do not think of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That true…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, what Tachibana said was absolutely right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think like that as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, this thought process is very rare, and not easy to accomplish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only someone like me, who has given up on youth from the bottom of my heart, can think like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why would a beautiful girl like Tachibana say such a thing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had unconsciously begun to be interested in Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am not blaming Kusuba-san, and I do not hold any grudge.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; well, can I ask you a question?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That guy&#8230; the one who confessed to you, did he try anything after that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After that, huh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He was a bad person, right? Even though he might look like the quiet type, they can become dangerous sometimes. I was wondering if something happened afterward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything happened to Tachibana, it is half my responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking in that way, I couldn’t help but worry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that question, Tachibana answered with a light tone, the usual and expressionless face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He had tried to retaliate, so I went to my friends. I don&#8217;t think he will try anything anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Revenge?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I heard it, my mind exploded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between her voice and cute face was too much to handle. She laughed as she looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…strange person,” so I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry… I didn’t mean to laugh.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…It’s alright”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t care now, so I started with my sushi again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana seems to be a little different from the one I had heard and thought about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We shall not be involved anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I was lucky to know such a side of Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way, Kusuba-san,”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why are you wearing a hat in a store?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…No reason”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was giving me a strange look while tilting her head.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Kaitori-Zushi trip failed its purpose due to the encounter with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And… to make it worse, the relationship between me and Tachibana, which was supposed to have completely ended, has also built back, just a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just who can predict that a beautiful girl will come to Kaiten-Zushi, alone, and sit next to me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was definitely an accident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just an unexpected accident.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I convinced myself, improved my mood, and came to eat out yet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this time, I came to a different place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello, welcome.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a privately owned Tsukemen restaurant that was near the urban area around the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Tsukemen is similar to ramen)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seafood tsukemen here is very delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price is a little high, ¥1000, but the taste is good enough for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chances of Tachibana coming to this kind of store is null.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere here is far too different. As far as I know, most of the frequent customers are old men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a counter seat yet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So… welcome back, yet again, to my normal daily life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What are you doing here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to punch myself a few times while talking to the female customer next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And again, next to me was Tachibana Rika.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, she looked even more casual than last time.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be more precise, she was wearing a black shirt with denim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked like a boy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a beautiful girl, that doesn’t even lose any cuteness with such clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it is not that I was checking her fashion sense…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looking at the one wearing such clothes, I should be the one asking that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was first, but what do you mean?&#8221; She said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I mean, why are you here?”</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The same question? I came to eat the seafood tsukemen, it’s quite delicious here.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, it is delicious, the seafood tsukemen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huh? Wait. That’s not what I wanted to know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is she in the same place as I am again?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will not give up,” I had said to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I can’t even stay away from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I ended up choosing the shop because I thought it would be impossible to meet here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, wait a minute for the Tsukemen. Tachibana-san comes very often, so I’ll give some extra.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s also a regular…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, even I got a bonus for the first time…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And, thanks to Kusuba-san as well. Yes, another bonus”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one possibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a coincidence that the views and path of life are similar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the only possibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is that really possible?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This situation, the coincidence. And that too, 2 in a row.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…We are quite similar, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as she said that, I had a flashback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The line I had ignored when we were eating lunch on the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the words that I pretended I couldn&#8217;t hear&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is absolutely no way that we are the slightest bit similar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m just a mob. Student A. The person who spends all the time in the background.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Tachibana is a ridiculously beautiful girl, with stylish friends, and huge popularity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you not eating?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the tsukemen gets cold, the taste is changed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible for us to be similar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you just try to think of it, it&#8217;s completely wrong.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why did Tachibana say such a thing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But more than that, what was she trying to do by saying that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it’s still quite delicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;It does look so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I know. Because of that, I am wearing old clothes, so even if I get dirty, I can eat comfortably.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, so that black shirt was for that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, that’s right. Kusuba-san’s shirt is for the same reason? That shirt is for tsukemen, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, these are my casual clothes.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…?! I’m really sorry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, don’t apologize. That just makes it worse.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry that my casual clothes look dirty</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I thought to myself.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.3</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana continued to eat her tsukemen happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did not have the cold atmosphere as she had at school, but was just enjoying what she liked from her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also ate my tsukemen. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is much more delicious if more people eat together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have heard that line many times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I don’t agree with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s much easier to eat alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also focus more on the taste.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not about the company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think eating alone is bad, but I know I am one of the few who think that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But maybe Tachibana thought the same way…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was delicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gochisousama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We finished eating our food almost at the same time as we put down our bowl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After drinking water, we took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Umm… Tachibana.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Kusuba-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think eating together with people makes the food tastier?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I prefer to eat alone. That way I can focus on the taste more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana gave that reply in a serious tone.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, she was right…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are times I want to eat with my friends, of course. But that’s more about talking rather than eating.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so? I was cross-checking as I don’t have anyone to talk to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;… you don’t have anyone to talk to…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm…? EH! Stop looking so sorry! My bad, my bad.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana giggled as I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her appearance and expressions were many times more attractive than the usual cold-hearted personality, who always turned her shoulders and squinted her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Usually people eat with company. Even when they want to focus on the meal, they usually eat with company.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, I also understand that feeling. Though people like us are much more unusual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway… Doesn’t Tachibana-san care about the eyes around her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not that much. After all, it usually happens. And it’s not too crowded here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;… That’s true…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Tachibana and I might be just a little similar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing more to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though I am not going to say it loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, by the way, Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t expect much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I possess absolutely no useless hopes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Though I said earlier, today&#8217;s tsukemen with Kusuba-san was perhaps more delicious than usual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I am not excited at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: By Tachibana’s words)</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.4</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a few days, I ate tsukemen with Tachibana…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came to a public bath in my neighborhood to clear the instability in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alone, as expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have any complaints?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public baths are good.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gives me the feeling that my unstable heart and bad luck will get washed away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it would have been better the nude old men wouldn’t be here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wash your head, body, and soak in the water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like I am reviving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…But these days have been strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, our relationship keeps getting closer and closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complete opposite of a mob-like me, a ridiculously beautiful girl.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between us was supposed to end quickly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now her impression inside me was changing.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana doesn’t seem to as a “normal” high-school girl as I had thought.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seems to be more to her.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, it should be impossible for her way of thinking and paths to overlap this much.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it&#8217;s just that we have a similar way of thinking.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nothing special.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just an unusual coincidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stand up and leave the bathhouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed my clothes. Then I bought a coffee, paid my fee for the bath, and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yup, it’s not something to worry about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all over now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever Tachibana is, it is not related to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;As I thought, I am getting a dangerous feeling”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have stopped being surprised now…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana Rika, with slightly red-dyed cheeks, was standing in front of the bath with an alluring posture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her hair is also wet. Seems like even she came here to take a bath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…why are you here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For taking a bath. Isn’t that obvious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn’t that obvious?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, it’s practically impossible to say it’s a coincidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don’t you have a bath at your house?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course, I have. But the bath at the bathhouse making my heart clam and feels as if all bad things will get washed away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing, nothing”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We just stared at each other for a moment and walked out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t help but worry about what has happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s 10 o’clock at night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, It’s getting very late.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that’s the case, should I walk her home?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, won’t it be annoying, if a dark, background mob is following you home?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Tachibana might not want me to know where she lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Let’s just stop thinking of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s obvious…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a thing that should be done by a “good-looking” guy can’t be done by me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bye. Be careful on your way home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a shame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why are you following me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s my line. Why are you walking with me?”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s because my house is this way, I always walk this way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even I am on my way home…”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.5</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While facing me on the route at night, Tachibana had a wry smile on her face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, even I had such an expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well… if you think about it, we had also met in Kaiten-Zushi. It’s a possibility that that’s close to your home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“True, it is. Even tsukemen restaurants don’t work well unless they are in the neighborhood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a brief pause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, at the same time, we exploded with laughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, who was usually calm and composed, was holding her belly and laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that she lives nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… seeing all the coincidences up till now, it seems obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now I understand. Let&#8217;s go home together till our paths divide. Or it’ll get weird.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It would, it’ll become strange if one of us takes a detour for no reason.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded while I was a bit stunned, then Tachibana and I started walking again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walked side by side, at a leisurely pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever happens in the future, I feel like I could get along with Tachibana for today.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a gentle night breeze blew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana’s hair fluttered in the wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene was just beautiful. As if it was from a scene in a movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came back from my thoughts with a sudden call from Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My strange reaction caused her to tilt her head a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, now that I think of it, I did say something like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good… It was not my aura…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh… oh, yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel regret for saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to justify myself, for no apparent reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I prefer one person’s company rather than many.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s much easier to have only one good friend. Socializing is tiring. And if you&#8217;re alone, you don&#8217;t have to get along with or quarrel with anyone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you get into arguments often?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until middle school, I had some people who I could call friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as we talked and played together, they all moved away from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the cause for that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My personality is not suitable for socializing. I have a bad personality.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was silent. She had a different expression, her fingers on one side of her beautiful face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Translation here was a bit weird to just, Japanese-English. Basically, Tachibana had her fingers on her jaw, like she was stating a fact. She was not covering her face or blushing, probably.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also didn’t say anything more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… I’ve reached home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I stop in front of my apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just say our goodbyes again and move on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, for some reason, Tachibana was looking at me with a difficult expression.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;there is another building of this apartment at the back, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;? Yes, Building B. That’s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, I have hardly ever noticed it before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I never interact with any residents over there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait… Why does Tachibana know that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That’s my house.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she said so, she let out a wry laugh.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.6</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;EH? Next door?!&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was lunch break the following day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I spoke about yesterday’s incidents to Kyoya, he shouted in a dumb voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Idiot, What are you shouting for?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? Ah, sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Geez…”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, no one heard the words that were shouted by Kyoya. Though there was one person who looked over, but he just glanced and didn’t seem interested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was it really a good idea to tell Kyoya…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like I really shouldn’t have told him…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not next door, at the back. The apartment has another building at the back separated by a fence. Though you can easily pass through using the back door.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The same apartment? How did you not notice?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The entrances are different for each building. Mine is on the south, while Tachibana’s building is on the north. And you just have to go straight to reach school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You used a different street to go to school? I get it now…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maybe that’s it. The public bath was on the south street. So, the way back was covered.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaaa&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya seemed very impressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that quickly became a mischievous grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So… In other words, there&#8217;s still a possibility for you to get along with Tachibana-san, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya whispered to me, as he came and our shoulders touched each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skinship is the same as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he still hasn’t given up&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, there is no such possibility. I don’t something like that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t lie. If that’s true, why did you tell me this story in the first place?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing me struggling with an answer, Kyoya scanned me with an unpleasant gaze that seemed to see through everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, Ren, I don&#8217;t think you have such a bad personality,&#8221; he said. “Tachibana-san is grateful to you so don’t think much about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That relationship of favors is long gone.&#8221; I replied. “Don&#8217;t keep bringing up that story.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The only thing that&#8217;s gone is that relation regarding the favors, right? The feeling of a person once changed doesn&#8217;t disappear so quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya replied to my remark with a dazzling smile that seemed to make me angry.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He speaks as if he understands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To give me useless expectations, what does this guy want to do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ren, it’s my dream, to go on a double date with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…If you’re serious, that was really disgusting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not joking! I’m serious!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If so, keep dreaming. That will never come true in your entire life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh? Keep watching, I’ll definitely make it happen.” Kyoya laughed carelessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So…This guy is an idiot after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like it’s useless no matter what I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But, it would be nice if Ren got along with Tachibana-san, right?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to his words, I immediately thought of Tachibana’s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ridiculously beautiful and perfect face…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A joyful expression while eating sushi…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A curious face, while tilting the head on the side…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every Tachibana was beautiful without a doubt.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if a person exists in this world who can say he doesn’t want to get along with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“See, you can’t even deny it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No… I mean… I’m just confused…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t like Kyoya’s pushy attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I&#8217;m not.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not the kind of person who can face others properly like you.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations while approaching them, then you fail and hate yourself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the usual pattern.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I can’t handle the stress coming on me because of my opponent, so I’m giving up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well… I wouldn’t force you either. If you don’t want to get along with her, you can give up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, but if you want to get along with Tachibana-san, I will support you with all my power and help you out.” Kyoya said while giving me a thumbs up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the school bell sounded and the break ended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya stood up to go back to his seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a selfish guy…”</span></p>
