<h2>Chapter 2: Reason to Fight</h2>

<p>Three weeks after being fired from Sato's party.</p>

<p>Since then, I desperately searched for other parties, but there were none recruiting unranked members.</p>

<p>This is because, in general, those who become clearers start from E-rank. Being unranked is not much different from the humans before they possessed magical power. Considering things like fighting against grotesque monsters as a regular human; while making up the bottom 1% of humanity, rather than holding scarcity, unranked are simply treated as rare.</p>

<p>On top of that, in terms of being unranked, I'm even near the bottom, that's because I&rsquo;m trash with magic power of just 5.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry bags or anything else. Can you please find a party for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to say this, but currently there are zero open recruitment requests for unranked individuals. Well, at the moment, we&rsquo;re currently sending requests to parties currently clearing E-ranked dungeons but...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Japan Dungeon Association Tokyo Division, the dungeon association that regulates dungeons across the world.</p>

<p>Around me, dungeon clearers just like me were doing things like converting their magic stones into money and taking request for cubes that were near dungeon collapse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah is that so...Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While looking for a party that might accept me, for multiple days in a row I wandered around.</p>

<p>But clearers who aimed for dungeons categorified as the bottom rank E-Rank were in few numbers, and even the ones that existed already had full parties.</p>

<p>For that reason, I was relentlessly rejected.</p>

<p>But this is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Everyone is putting their lives on the line; they don&rsquo;t have the room to place someone in their party through thin good will if that person is just going to be a burden.</p>

<p>I, alone, left the Dungeon Association with heavy footsteps.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That day, late at night, while by myself, I muttered curses.</p>

<p>Even after searching for a party this much, not being able to find one. Even after explaining about my sick sister, the Association won&rsquo;t do anything for me.</p>

<p>Even though the deadline is closing in, with panic from not being able to see the road ahead and lack of sleep, I was extremely frustrated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nagi ended up waking up after hearing my voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah... Sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big brother...are you getting enough sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Said Nagi, seeing the bags beneath my eyes.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s due to these past few days running around busily and not resting because of stress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m not resting, who&rsquo;s fault do you think it is that I&rsquo;m running around so much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out of my antagonized state, my words grew thorns. What am I saying?</p>

<p>Stop it, none of this is Nagi&rsquo;s fault. Please stop it.</p>

<p>Even while understanding that, I couldn&rsquo;t control my emotions.</p>

<p> &ldquo;What do you think&rsquo;s going to happen if you get weak and accidentally injure yourself? Quit it and just go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;B-But...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quit and go to sleep...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big brother, I...You know...Big brother. I always...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All you do is fucking sleep, so go to sleep!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as I said it, I realized.</p>

<p>That was the worst thing I could have said. Even though I was angry, those were words that should have never been uttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;S-Sorry...I&rsquo;m always...Thankful...I was just a bit scared and wanted to be by your side...I&rsquo;m sorry...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;*Haah* What am I doing...&rdquo;</p>

<p>While hitting my head, I promised myself that I would apologize to Nagi the next morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>~The Next Day Morning</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning Nagi, so about yesterday...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big brother... *Haa* *Haa*...good...morning&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nagi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the early morning, as I was heading towards Nagi&rsquo;s futon to apologize, I was met with an obviously weakened Nagi.</p>

<p>With seemingly painful breaths, Nagi, with all of her might tried to move, but her body didn&rsquo;t seem to be responding very well.</p>

<p>I immediately went to pick Nagi up but, that body of hers was unbelievably cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nagi! Are you okay!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared...Big Brother...I&rsquo;m so scared...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay! We&rsquo;re going to the hospital immediately!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I picked up my little sister and without even locking the door, dashed towards the hospital.</p>

<p>That sickened back held no power within it; I could only hear small breaths.</p>

<p>I could hear my heart beating through my chest, not because I was tired out, but because the feeling that I would be crushed by anxiety soon was running through my head.</p>

<p>Nagi&rsquo;s condition is what is called 'Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis&rsquo; phase 2'.</p>

<p>While moving the body being difficult, somehow with one&rsquo;s own power being able to breath, as well as being able to walk a small amount.</p>

<p>Never again being able to open one&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>Until death...no, even after death.</p>

<p>While praying to a God that I don&rsquo;t even believe in, I headed straight towards the hospital.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>At the National Clearer Exclusive Hospital</p>

<p>Backed wholeheartedly by Japan, a large hospital specifically used by clearers for wounds, prognostic symptoms, or even for their current family or left-behind family members.</p>

<p>A government plan enacted in order to increase the amount of clearers.</p>

<p>While barely catching my breath, as if panicking, while carrying Nagi, I went up and pleaded to the receptionist.</p>

<p>Shortly after, our designated doctor came.</p>

<p>With glasses hanging from his nose and wearing a white coat.</p>

<p>A 30-something, strict-seeming, but caring towards his patients, doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sensei! Nagi is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kai-kun...let&rsquo;s carry her immediately, over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once inside the room we were ushered into, I laid Nagi down.</p>

<p>As the examination started, outside the room I bawled up my intertwined hands and placed them in front of my forehead, almost as if praying, I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>My legs were shaking.</p>

<p>While doing that, when just a few minutes had passed, Ijuin-sensei appeared came outside.</p>

<p>And I was greeted with words that I didn&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sensei!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kai-kun, this is hard to say but...It&rsquo;s phase 3. All we can do is to enter her in as a patient, put her on a breathing machine and with that we can extend her life...we&rsquo;ve already completed the initial process so don&rsquo;t panic but...most likely, she won&rsquo;t ever open her eyes again...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-No! T-that&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phase 3. That basically a death sentence.</p>

<p>No matter how much power one puts in, the body, almost as if wrapped in metal wire, can&rsquo;t breathe properly.</p>

<p>Without enough power to open one&rsquo;s eyes, just quietly trapped in one&rsquo;s own body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sensei! Something! Isn't there anything that can be done!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Sorry, the cure to this disease still hasn&rsquo;t been discovered. To begin with, magic power itself is too unknown...the modern medical solution currently...can only extend the patient&rsquo;s life...The ears should still be able to hear so, at the very least using your voice...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I already understand that.</p>

<p>Even while understanding, I still ask if there&rsquo;s anything that can be done.</p>

<p>But even still, the answer doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>

<p>With a bow, Ijuin-sensei leaves.</p>

<p>After, a specialized machine is carried in and fitted to Nagi.</p>

<p>I, while by her side, grasped her hand.</p>

<p>It was cold.</p>

<p>Almost as if blood was not flowing.</p>

<p>But her eyes were still open.</p>

<p>While fighting to not close her eyes, Nagi looks over here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nagi...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though up until yesterday she was laughing, until then, the thought of the disease worsening was something I didn&rsquo;t even imagine.</p>

<p>I hear that with this disease, one where at the end, almost as if one has anemia, even standing is a difficult, will continue to go on.</p>

<p>The body becomes gradually moves less and less, and one&rsquo;s body stops being their own. Just how frightening is that process?</p>

<p>And yet even then, Nagi continued to face me with a smile.</p>

<p>In order to not worry me, she hid that pain.</p>

<p>Even yesterday, she still must have been in enough fear to paralyze.</p>

<p>And yet, those words.</p>

<p>Even though Nagi told me she loves me, I returned nothing and couldn&rsquo;t tell my own feelings.</p>

<p>Something like that being our last conversation...</p>

<p>&ldquo;*Eugh**eugh* Nagi...I&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;m so sorry...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at the sickly face of Nagi who was staring back at me.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. The fact that I would never see that smile again.</p>

<p>In the world there are hundreds of thousands of people afflicted with this disease.</p>

<p>After all of humanity awaked, immediately, people across the world became fervent at finding a cure and began searching so, one day, it might be found.</p>

<p>For that reason, until that time comes, I want to extend her life as much as possible.</p>

<p>For that reason, I can&rsquo;t quit being a clearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nagi...Your big brother is going to try. Try and... fight. I&rsquo;m going to pull you out from there at all costs, so...&rdquo;</p>

<p>After wiping my tears, I strongly grasped that frigid hand.</p>

<p>While look straight towards Nagi, I decided.</p>

<p>That even If it&rsquo;s alone, I&rsquo;m going to clear dungeons.</p>

<p>Even if I can&rsquo;t do it, even if I die in the dungeon, my license won&rsquo;t be revoked.</p>

<p>Rather, support towards my left behind family will be provided for.</p>

<p>For that reason, even if I die, Nagi should still receive health care.</p>

<p>I repeat the words I couldn't say yesterday over and over again.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagi... I love you. I love Nagi, so!&quot;</p>

<p>And then, I grasp Nagi's hand tightly once again.</p>

<p>&quot;I know...&quot;</p>

<p>With a hoarse voice, Nagi musters all her remaining strength to smile. She grips my hand tightly and then weakly, slowly closing her eyes.</p>

<p>That day, I spoke to Nagi late into the night, knowing that I wouldn't receive a response. Nevertheless, I kept talking and talking.</p>

<p>And then, I stood up.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagi, I will definitely save you. I promise you that.&quot;</p>

<p>With determination,</p>

<p>&quot;Even if I have to risk my life.&quot;</p>

<p>I will face forward.</p>

<p>&#9671;At the same time Shibuya Crossing</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what's that?&quot;</p>

<p>In the heart of the Shibuya Scramble Crossing in Tokyo, As the signal turned green, a massive crowd of pedestrians intermingled and crossed the intersection, walking pedestrian heaven.</p>

<p>One of the passersby noticed something and pointed towards the sky. As everyone's gaze followed their finger, they all began to look up at the sky one after another.</p>

<p>A square-shaped object shining in gold was slowly falling from the sky.</p>

<p>The time was evening, and the season was summer. Despite being illuminated by the red light of the setting sun, the object shone brightly in gold as it fell.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, isn't that...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Cube!! That's a Cube, isn't it?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A Cube?! A golden one?! I've never heard of that color before!&quot;</p>

<p>Passersby took photos with their smartphones one after another.</p>

<p>That box, called a Cube, which served as the entrance to another realm, while resisting gravity, slowly fell, like a leaf falling from a tree.</p>

<p>The pedestrians watched as it descended to the ground while moving away the impact site. The signal changed, and the sound of car horns filled the air.</p>

<p>The Cube landed slowly and silently in the middle of that place.</p>

<p>Shining in a dazzling golden color that no one had ever seen before.</p>
