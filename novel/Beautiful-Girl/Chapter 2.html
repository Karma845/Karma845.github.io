<h2>Chapter 2: The Salt Forest<h2>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4></p>

<p> I dreamed again today.</p>

<p>That dream where that cowardly and dull girl got stabbed and fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it because I slept in a strange place? ...Fwaaah, achoo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I crawled out of the jute bag, I yawned and sneezed at the same time, and my body shivered.</p>

<p>If it got out that I slept in the atelier, and what&rsquo;s more, a jute bag, then Thor would be angry at me. He would say, Even servants don&rsquo;t sleep in a place like that.</p>

<p>This was the atelier for mixing magical potions, located in the O&rsquo;Drielle family mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father and Mother said it was still too early for me, but today is the day that I will make the &lsquo;Ribito Salve&rsquo;. You failed three times already, and there won&rsquo;t be a next time, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told myself, put my long hair into a ponytail and fired myself up.</p>

<p>The O&rsquo;Drielle family mansion was so dilapidated and out of fashion that it was made fun of by the kids in the nearby village as a haunted house, but even so, we were still a respected family of magicians, the descendants of the &ldquo;worst witch in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was the next baroness of my house, Makia O&rsquo;Drielle.</p>

<p>Even though I was still only an eleven-year-old girl, I had a provocative, villainous woman&rsquo;s face with red lips, and I was told that when I was born, my parents rejoiced that &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be the worst witch!&rdquo; just from looking at my face. When my baby&rsquo;s sneeze burned my father&rsquo;s beard, he cried, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be the strongest witch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was rumored that I was for certain going to be a selfish and wicked witch like that &ldquo;Scarlet Witch&rdquo;, but my parents thoroughly affirmed that &ldquo;We&rsquo;re expecting it,&rdquo; and turned it into my confidence and pride.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t hate myself.</p>

<p>I liked my appearance, and I was smart. I had the courage to try anything without fear of failure, and I even had the heart to show appreciation for our small number of servants. Every year on their birthdays, I would give them a handwritten card and magical potpourri.</p>

<p>However, an existence that shook my self-esteem appeared&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, it&rsquo;s very strange. I&rsquo;ve been told since I was a baby that I was a once in a hundred years outstanding talent of the O&rsquo;Drielle family, and I&rsquo;ve been working so hard, yet I&rsquo;m being surpassed by Thor in just half a year&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I muttered as I stood on a stool and precisely threw in the ingredients for the potion.</p>

<p>Yes. Thor, the slave I bought.</p>

<p>His magical talent far exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>He started studying magic in earnest, and in just half a year, he became equal, no, depending on the magic, he became stronger than me, and he was making that talent bloom.</p>

<p>Even yesterday, when I caused an explosion because I made a mistake in the mixing of &ldquo;Ribito Salve&rdquo; and ended up having Thor help put out the fire, that rascal laughed at me and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Mistress Makia is surprisingly normal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaaaah, how cheeky, how cheeky! To think my talent is actually normal&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now he was completely my rival and has ignited my competitive spirit.</p>

<p>Thor was more or less a pupil of the O&rsquo;Drielle family and a servant.</p>

<p>At any rate, he was smart, and if you asked him to do something, he did it skillfully. He had an air of maturity you wouldn&rsquo;t expect from a twelve-year-old, probably because of his hardships. All those things made him fascinating and attractive to those around him. With a strange alluring charm that was uncharacteristic of a young boy, he was popular with the female servants.</p>

<p>My parents were magicians through and through, so they prized talent above all without caring about lineage or birth. They wanted to nurture what grew if you nurtured it.</p>

<p>In regards to magic, Father taught me and Thor together, and Thor also had a talent for the sword, not just magic, so our old knight, Godwin, was training him. Etiquette was taught by Mother, and Thor, who was a quick learner, could do everything.</p>

<p> My parents gave Thor a thorough education that he could boast about no matter where he went.</p>

<p>It was almost like my position was in jeopardy with the adoption of a son, but I was very happy that Thor, who was a slave, was able to develop his talents and get acknowledged.</p>

<p>But I couldn&rsquo;t lose, either.</p>

<p>And so I shut myself inside the atelier since last night. One might find it shocking that a child was cooking things in a pot as they pleased, but it was a common sight in the O&rsquo;Drielle house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>While extracting the essence from the herbs through boiling them, when I looked outside the atelier window, Thor was working hard at sword practice right then. Since morning, he was being taught the basics from our old knight Godwin. He fell down over and over, but always got up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufu, do your best, do your best!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I saw Thor working hard, I also got motivated.</p>

<p>His feelings of not wanting to lose were precious. Thanks to them, I was surely getting closer to the strongest and worst witch.</p>

<p>I got on top of the stool again and peered into the pot with a prim face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyaaah! I boiled it too much!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One hour had passed since then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Thor, are you finished with sword training?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, lightly tugging on the back of his clothes. Thor was washing his face in the water fountain, but he turned around when I called out to him.</p>

<p>His wet black hair looked even darker and more beautiful. Black hair was very rare in this country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything you need, milady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to visit Grandmother in the Salt Forest, and I want you to come along with me. I&rsquo;m going there to receive toothpaste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Salt Forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vast pure white forest in the northernmost part of Deliafield is called the &lsquo;Salt Forest.&rsquo; You can gather plenty of unusual magical ingredients there, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting for you too, Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor blinked in surprise, and then he was thinking something over for a while. During that time, I raised my hand and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myr vis makia&mdash;&mdash;Wash and dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I easily used heat magic and ordered Thor&rsquo;s sweaty body and hair to dry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah, thank you very much, milady. ...As expected, I am still no match for you in&#12304;Fire&#12305;attribute magic. That is to be expected of one who is blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel somewhat irritated even though I was praised&#8230; Change into your nice suit immediately!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooh, scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor took flight with a facetious look on his face and immediately returned, having changed his clothes.</p>

<p>I also put on my black robe, prepared the basket I would be taking with me, and got ready.</p>

<p>We rode the carriage to the entrance of the Salt Forest while being seen off by Mother. The one who accompanied us was our old knight Godwin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May you not be late in returning, Young Mistress Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;I won&rsquo;t. Godwin, please come here again in five hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you wish. Thor, you must protect the young mistress. That is the duty of a knight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes. I will, master.&rdquo;</p>

<p> From there, only Thor and I advanced into the forest. It starts out as an ordinary forest, but gradually, you would come to understand the reason why it was called the &ldquo;Salt Forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heh. The plants and soil and rocks really are white. And, the temperature suddenly dropped. Is your playground such an empty and lifeless place, milady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes it is. But there&rsquo;s no other place that&rsquo;s this fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor called me &ldquo;milady&rdquo; when it was just the two of us.</p>

<p>Rather than being called the long-winded Young Mistress Makia, I liked the feeling of intimacy. He might just be teasing me by calling me that, though.</p>

<p>I have told him before that he didn&rsquo;t need to speak politely to me, but he had laughed scornfully and told me to &ldquo;please consider my position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think Thor was more comfortable speaking politely. Also, polite speech might allow him to tease me as he pleased. I was impressed with the perfect balance in that area.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it that this forest is so white? The scent of magic is also strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, there&rsquo;s a unique magic seeping out from a place deep below the ground, and it crystallized white on the ground surface. It looks just like salt, so this place is the Salt Forest. There&rsquo;s actually a salt lake too, which yields salt that&rsquo;s rich in magical power. It&rsquo;s delicious salt that can also be used as a magical ingredient, so it sells like hotcakes and our family became rich from that, you could say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem. Several native species inhabit this forest, and you can find lots of unusual plants. Look, like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I reached the place that I was looking for, I dashed towards a white tree that bore vividly crimson fruits. I took out a pair of scissors from the pocket of my robe, stood on my tiptoes and began harvesting the fruit.</p>

<p>I put my harvest into the hood of my robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are these apples, milady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor nonchalantly held me up from the side.</p>

<p>The height difference between Thor and me were two heads. In contrast with him, who trained his body and kept shooting up, I remained scrawny and small.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The apples picked in this forest are &lsquo;salt apples&rsquo; that are packed full of the magical energy from the earth. They&rsquo;re actually a bit salty, and that saltiness enhances the sweetness of the honey, so they&rsquo;re really delicious. They&rsquo;re essential for the O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s traditional cooking and the making of magical treats. I&rsquo;m sure you have eaten a lot of them without even knowing it too, Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the mistress&rsquo;s signature &lsquo;apple pork rolls&rsquo; made with these salt apples, by any chance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes! I love that! There&rsquo;s also things like potato salad with salt apples, marinated mushrooms and salt apples, and salt apple cake. Salt apples can regulate the flow of magic within your body, so if you eat them everyday, the precision of your magic will go up. For magicians, it&rsquo;s like a miracle food.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, I&rsquo;m feeling somewhat hungry. Even though I came here after eating muffins with salt apples and caramel kneaded into them in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just the salt apples, but the plants and animals born here are all unique to this forest and have high magical power. There&rsquo;s still a lot of research to be done, and there&rsquo;s a lot of hidden possibilities. Oh, you can put me down now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I came down to the ground, I skillfully put the salt apples in my hood into a basket and took out a large picnic blanket and tea set instead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting hungry, so let&rsquo;s have a picnic around here, shall we? I&rsquo;ve brought a lot of food with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wanting to have a picnic in a scary forest with no sign of humans, you are just like a witch, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am one. Oh, I still haven&rsquo;t graduated from magic school yet, so I&rsquo;m a witch in the making.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t become a witch unless you graduate from magic school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case, but in my family, all our magicians are treated as magicians in the making until we graduate from magic school. No matter how much magic you mastered as a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I talked about that, I searched the basket again and took out this and that.</p>

<p>This basket was a magical basket that was once a favorite of the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch,&rdquo; and its outward appearance and actual volume were completely different. There was a magical space within the basket, divided into a refrigeration space, an insulation space, a room temperature space, and other spaces. It was useful for carrying around food and storing things you&rsquo;ve gathered. Even though it was an item from five hundred years ago, it had an advanced and sophisticated spatial magic.</p>

<p>I took out cookware for outdoor use...and then some long and narrow rye bread, a jar of mayonnaise, pickles, olives, small iceberg lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, duck ham&#8230;</p>

<p>After magically filling a bowl with water and washing vegetables and the salt apples I just picked in it,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Thor, cut one salt apple into thin slices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I casually threw one to Thor.</p>

<p>Thor used&#12304;Wind&#12305;magic and enclosed the apple into a sphere of wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saga rham thor&mdash;&mdash;O wind, split it into parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He chanted that, and within the sphere, an unseen blade of wind came and went, cutting the apple into the thin slices I wanted.</p>

<p>This was a small-scale containment barrier of wind. It was very difficult to not only control wind, but also use it to limit space. This boy was able to use difficult techniques very easily, I see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you using these for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m using them for sandwiches. Salt apples are salty-sweet, and when they&rsquo;re fresh, you can use them as a dressing. They go really well with duck ham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see. So that is the case&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lightly roasted the sliced duck ham. I was good at&#12304;Fire&#12305;magic, and it was useful for times like these.</p>

<p>After all, all I had to do was to thrust my finger at the duck ham lined up on the plate and order them to cook.</p>

<p>After roasting the duck ham, I cut the rye bread in half and sliced them horizontally, spread mayonnaise on one side, and finished by putting the roasted duck ham, the torn-up lettuce, sliced tomatoes, salt apples, pickles and olives in between the slices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re done! The O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s traditional recipe, salt apple and duck ham sandwich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought you would surely bring them ready-made. I did not think you would make them here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother said magical cooking is most delicious and effective when freshly made. Also, it&rsquo;s special training for magic of different elements. We actually used water, fire, and wind magic, right? Now, let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I bit into the sandwich with fresh and juicy vegetables and duck ham from one end.</p>

<p>The duck ham had plenty of pepper on the skin, and when seared, it was dripping with meat juices, which combined with the fruity juices of the salt apples created an excellent taste. By sandwiching them with bread, it was a luxury to be able to wrap up everything and eat it all in one go. It was a light yet highly satisfying dish that made you feel good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, this, this. You can even say that the magicians of the O&rsquo;Drielle family are raised on these salt apples.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly...the duck ham and salt apples go well together. This is delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the meal, we boiled water, laid out a glass tea set, and made fresh herb tea with the herbs grown in the O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s herb garden. Or rather, Thor made it. It seemed that Mother taught him how to make tea at an early stage.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Ruschia was a country where the glasswork industry was thriving, and glass was commonplace for teapots and teacups. When sunlight shone through the trees, the way the green of the herbs submerged in hot water reflected it was very beautiful.</p>

<p>The gentle and refreshing scent of herbs was stimulating and also comforting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lemon balm, rosemary, peppermint...Haa, what a nice smell. I should have also brought some sweets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we also pick some wild strawberries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s fine. Grandmother would have perceived that we entered the forest, so she is surely waiting for us with freshly baked cookies. I have to be hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thanks to the herb tea, I felt refreshed. Magicians often drank herb tea as it helped to restore magical energy.</p>

<p>Early afternoon in the Salt Forest. I didn&rsquo;t dislike the serenity of teatime, spent with Thor.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4></p>

<p>Now, it was time to walk through the forest again after lunch and teatime were over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah, my hair got caught!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since I was walking straight ahead and pushing my way through the vegetation, my long hair got caught on a tree branch on the way. Thor arrived immediately and dexterously freed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good grief. Please pay attention, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Thor. My hair gets caught a lot when I&rsquo;m walking through the Salt Forest. For some reason, the trees pull my hair towards them like static electricity. Perhaps it&rsquo;s better to cut it short.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said and pinched my hair, toying with it. Thor hurriedly shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not do that, milady. Only your hair is very beautiful, so you must treasure it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;Only my hair&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Witches grew their hair long in accordance with the old-fashioned tradition that those with longer hair could use magic better, but recently some say that had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Well, if Thor liked it in his own way, then I would grow it long. I suppose I would do my best to take care of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, milady, what are those?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking up at the tree my hair got caught on, Thor seemed to have spotted something.</p>

<p>He shot an&#12304;Ice&#12305;blade at the tree branches overhead and cut off the branch he was targeting.</p>

<p>He easily caught the fallen branch and stared at it closely.</p>

<p>At the tip of the branch he was holding, there were several crystallized droplets dangling from it. They were very pretty, like opals that enclosed rainbow-colored light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sprang up before the unexpected rare items.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are &lsquo;tears of the Salt Forest!&rsquo; They are crystallizations of the particularly high-quality magical energies deep within the earth that have been sucked up. It&rsquo;s very rare to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Will they fetch a high price if you sell them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;D-don&rsquo;t do such a wasteful thing! It&rsquo;ll be really expensive to buy it afterward! It gives magical support, so it should be used as a decoration for swords or wands, or set in a ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p> And then I proudly showed him my own white silver ring. The center was inlaid with a tear of the Salt Forest.</p>

<p>In contrast to me, who was somewhat excited, Thor was cool and picked the tears of the Salt Forest from the branch right away before stuffing them into his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, I&rsquo;ve brought a storage jar so you can store them properly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;You seem messy, but you are surprisingly meticulous, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we were having fun picking this and that, I noticed a giant flickering shadow and raised my head in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aaah, it&rsquo;s a blue dragonfly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got excited once again and chased after it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, milady! Don&rsquo;t move around so quickly, you might fall down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started running, and Thor hurriedly chased after me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up, up!&rdquo; I said, pointing above my head and jumping, and Thor finally moved his gaze up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He widened his eyes, which was rare for him, and looked surprised with a boyish face. The huge thin bug with translucent blue wings was floating around, undulating in the gaps of a great white zelkova tree.</p>

<p>When it went right below the sun, its wings reflected the light, and the color became transparent like stained glass and became reflected in the white forest. A gentle and fluid &ldquo;blue&rdquo; covered the whole area.</p>

<p>This phenomenon was called the &ldquo;Salt Forest&rsquo;s sea bottom.&rdquo; Because it was just like you were looking up at the water&rsquo;s surface from the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it. That bug only lives in the Salt Forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might come here to see the blue dragonflies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I glanced at Thor. Seeing his violet eyes filled with astonishment, excitement and curiosity made me feel glad that I brought him here.</p>

<p>Then, I also immersed myself within the art of the fantastical forest once again.</p>

<p>We only gazed at the relaxed movements of the insect. A comfortable time went by quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, milady! That bug dropped its wing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No way! Where did it fall!? The dropped wings of blue dragonflies have the power to reflect magic! They become valuable armor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went around finding and collecting that could only be gathered in the Salt Forest in this way, just like a treasure hunt.</p>

<p>Thor, who usually acted like a grown-up, looked somewhat child-like and seemed to be having fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was so absorbed in the hunt that I didn&rsquo;t watch where I was going and tripped over a tree root, and then got thrown down a steep slope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor grabbed my arm and pulled me into a protective embrace, and we fell down the slope together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Uuu, uuuu. Thor, I&rsquo;m sorry. It&rsquo;s all because I didn&rsquo;t pay attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a result, Thor&rsquo;s arms, cheeks and legs were scraped all over.</p>

<p>I had no injuries. Because I rolled down the slope, there were a lot of leaves and branches caught in my hair, making it look like a bird&rsquo;s nest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The injuries are not serious. It is much better than when I was being kicked or punched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t things you should make comparisons with!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sniffled and took out from my bag a small bottle of the potion I just made this morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use this. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Ribito Salve&rsquo; I made this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh. Is that...safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor put himself on guard. It was true that this was a potion I repeatedly failed at making many times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I succeeded in making it perfectly this morning! Here, please be a test subject for my medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were crying so touchingly a second ago&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was made by boiling the flesh of the big aloe fruits grown in the O&rsquo;Drielle&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s greenhouse and hairy grey heather, then mixing in Red Powder No.8, salt from the Salt Forest, and the saliva of the Ribito frog before boiling it all down.</p>

<p>It was a thick, deep pink ointment. When I applied it to Thor&rsquo;s injuries, the cuts disappeared before my eyes. It was completely clean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooh. There might not be much of a difference from the healing power of the Master&rsquo;s medicine. It is amazing, is it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, exactly! Well, I can also do it if I try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Praised by Thor, I crossed my arms in pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it smells somewhat strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;T-that&rsquo;s because I boiled the herbs too much. ...I&rsquo;ll be careful next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Thor, he noticed these kinds of things immediately. He patted my head with a straight face in contrast to my pouting lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What. You&rsquo;re treating me like a little kid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I just thought that you really were a genuine witch, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you say I was &lsquo;normal&rsquo; yesterday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had a sulky look on my face.</p>

<p>As Thor pinched my cheek with his hand, squeezing it and toying with it,</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was...because you were crying a lot harder than I thought you would after you failed, so I thought you were normal, acting like a child your age would. That word came out of my mouth because you usually aren&rsquo;t all that normal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Is that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also, you are unexpectedly a crybaby, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah. That...might be so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A magician must not be emotional.</p>

<p>However, Mother and Father said that one must learn to cry while one is a child. When you cry, the magical energy within your body becomes cleaner, but it seemed that people forget how to cry once they become adults.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I misjudged you when I first met you, milady. I assumed you were a high-handed, selfish noble lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;But you were far beyond my imagination, milady. Or rather, you aren&rsquo;t on the dimensions of high-handed or selfish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? What do you possibly mean by that, Thor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it in a bad sense. Milady is sometimes self-important, but you&rsquo;re such a hard worker that it&rsquo;s astonishing, and you take care of yourself almost all the time instead of leaving it up to the servants. But even so, I still worry about you...You sometimes sleep in strange places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was sleeping in a jute bag this morning, so I can&rsquo;t make any excuses&#8230;When I was thinking that, Thor bowed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonetheless, I am sorry if I made you get the wrong idea. You truly are amazing, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? No, you don&rsquo;t have to apologize, Thor. I was the one who misunderstood on my own, and it just fired up my fighting spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fighting spirit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;L-like a sense of rivalry! You surpassed me so quickly after all&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said shyly as I poked my fingers together.</p>

<p>I had to reflect on myself. I assumed that everything Thor said was sarcastic. Even though Thor was just watching me closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is...surely because everyday is so fulfilling and fun. Seeing you work so hard at your magic makes me think I have to work hard as well. I want to be of use to the O&rsquo;Drielle house as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those were unexpected words. When I looked up, Thor also looked a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>Was it because they were honest words? So that meant he really&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? Really? You&rsquo;re having fun every day? Your life at our house, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, ah, yes. I like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, will you stay at the O&rsquo;Drielle house forever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor burst out laughing at me, who was persistently asking him questions. Then, making a cheeky face right at this critical moment,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going to feed me for life, milady, then I don&rsquo;t need to worry about missing a meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sidelong, flirtatious glance unlike a twelve year old kid, he teased me. A troublesome beautiful boy.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4></p>

<p>We had too many detours. Our original goal was to go on an errand to my grandmother, who lived in this forest.</p>

<p>We went off the regular route, but we tried to walk where we could for the time being.</p>

<p>If we found that we were clearly in distress, we had ways to deal with the situation in that case, so we didn&rsquo;t take it all that seriously and were captivated by the scenery that was a bit different than what we saw previously.</p>

<p>The trees around here were from an older time, so they were incredibly tall with thick trunks. They had strange scratches, like metal threads were wrapped around them or something like that&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, look, red anemones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amazing&#8230; They are blooming all over. So much that it is a little bit scary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certainly...precisely because this was a white forest, the red color looked even brighter, and this scenery seemed strange.</p>

<p>This sweeping red reminded me of something&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to go and pick a few?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I...suppose so. Let&rsquo;s give them to Grandmother as a present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stepped into the flower field of bright red anemones and carefully picked one.</p>

<p>The center of anemone flowers was pure black, just like some sort of eye.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I thought anemone flowers were the symbol of the &ldquo;Scarlet Witch.&rdquo; What were they in the language of flowers again?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, something jumped out from the root of the flower.</p>

<p>They were crimson, ball-sized frogs, charging repeatedly at my cheeks and feet.</p>

<p>They were Ribito frogs, a native species of the Salt Forest. One of the ingredients for the &ldquo;Ribito Salve&rdquo; was the saliva of these frogs. One wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, but having several of them was troublesome, and no matter how many times I shook them off, they kept headbutting me for some reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor pulled out his short sword and swung it, cutting off several of them.</p>

<p>However, just as he was having a hard time because there were too many of them, the shrill sound of a whistle came from somewhere, and the frogs, hating that sound, hopped away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, are you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hearing that very familiar voice, I looked up.</p>

<p>A witch, holding a staff from which a magical lantern hung, was standing on the other side of the flower field with a dove. The small and thin whistle hanging from her neck was made from the tears of the Salt Forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ran up to her and hugged her. This fashionable witch with short, flaxen hair and dove feather hair ornaments still looked young, even though I call her Grandmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just when I thought you would never come, I see you loitering in a place like this? The headbutts from Ribito frogs are quite painful. They are creatures of the attribute&#12304;Fire&#12305;, so they have the tendency to go towards warmer things. They must have been attracted to your high body temperature, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, you knew that I am here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Salt Forest is my garden. My faithful dove told me where you two were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doves gathered around Grandmother with the flapping of wings. Those were doves that patrolled the Salt Forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been waiting for you with plenty of freshly baked cookies. Now, come with me. The young lad over there as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We cut through the anemone flower field and followed Grandmother&rsquo;s guidance. After going through the depths of the forest where the trees were tall and the sun didn&rsquo;t shine through, we reached an old brick hut.</p>

<p>The name of my grandmother, who lived in this hut instead of the O&rsquo;Drielle family mansion, was Camellia.</p>

<p> She was a witch who married the previous head of the family. Apparently, she met my now-deceased grandfather when they were in magic school, and after she worked as a royal tutor, she married into the O&rsquo;Drielle family.</p>

<p>By the way, she was the one who named me. When she gave me the name &ldquo;Makia,&rdquo; my parents trembled with joy as one and exclaimed, &ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo;, and I loved that name as well. So I loved Grandmother as well.</p>

<p>The outside was chilly, but the hut was warm and filled with the sweet and savory scent of cookies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you enjoy your walk through the forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! We must exercise the O&rsquo;Drielle&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s special privilege to get valuable magical resources for free. Oh, here&rsquo;s a present from the royal capital from Father. And seasonings and a letter from Mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, I&rsquo;m delighted. Here is the book I&rsquo;ve been waiting for. And the seasonings I&rsquo;ve said I wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmother lived in this remote place, so sometimes she used a carrier dove to tell Father and Mother what she needed that she couldn&rsquo;t get. Father would buy them when he went on business trips to the capital, Mother would put them all together, and I would bring them here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve seen you as well, lad. Have you already gotten used to the O&rsquo;Drielle mansion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madam,&rdquo; Thor stood up straight and bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we met last, you looked like a burdock, but now you&rsquo;re starting to look a bit like a boy. Now, I shall make some milk coffee. Makia, your favorite cookies are on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yay!&rdquo; I said, taking my place at the table and reaching for a cookie.</p>

<p>I loved Grandmother&rsquo;s homemade cookies. Thick, swirled cookies of cocoa and plain flavor, with plenty of brown sugar stuck to the sides. Grandmother&rsquo;s cookies especially were exquisitely baked, and the crunchiness of the brown sugar was irresistible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufu, you truly do love sweets, Makia. You were like this ever since you were little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m a witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. All the famous magicians in history had a sweet tooth. The reason for this is because intaking sugar is the most effective for recovering after using magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I took a sip of the milk coffee with plenty of honey and sighed deeply.</p>

<p>As expected, it was the nature of magicians to feel happy when ingesting sweets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Thor doesn&rsquo;t have such a sweet tooth, does he?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;...I feel especially happy because I eat a little of them. Milady, what can I say, you eat too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had a point. Because he did, I felt a bit irritated. And Grandmother burst into laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; I said and took out a thick book from my basket, and then opened it to the place where I had put a tag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, I really don&rsquo;t understand this magic...When chanting the incantation, what does &lsquo;forget your child&rsquo;s heart for ten seconds&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmother was very good at teaching, enough that she used to be a tutor for the royal family.</p>

<p>She explained the parts I didn&rsquo;t understand in an understandable way, so whenever I visited Grandmother, I put together everything I wanted to ask beforehand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thor was looking around the room curiously. He looked very interested as he sipped his milk coffee.</p>

<p>The dim interior was illuminated by the magical lamp. Wild rose seeds and dried mimosa flowers hung down from the walls, and there were bottled medicinal ingredients, beans, nuts, dried fruits, sparkly minerals, animal bones, compasses, brooms, and old earthenware pots that look like they could hold a person. There were a lot of things in the O&rsquo;Drielle house, but there was a good old-fashioned magician&rsquo;s atmosphere here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there something you&rsquo;re curious about, lad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Madam, what era is this house from? It seems quite old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor was probably wondering for a long time why Grandmother lived in a place like this by herself. Even though the O&rsquo;Drielle family had such a magnificent mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the house where the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch&rsquo; lived five hundred years ago. Of course, it had gone through a few repairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...That Scarlet Witch was born in this Salt Forest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. I am living here because I want to know more about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, the O&rsquo;Drielle family was not a noble family from the beginning. Thanks to a certain young girl who later made a name for herself as the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch,&rsquo; and yielded great achievements and even greater crimes, we received a title and flourished. While our notoriety became widespread.</p>

<p>Grandmother was a researcher by nature and a Scarlet Witch enthusiast. While she managed this hut, she researched the Scarlet Witch and the Salt Forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Um, why did the Scarlet Witch burn the center of this world? All the books I read only say that she dragged in the Hero of Fraxinus and blew herself up. That is the only thing I do not understand. Was it necessary to go that far, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. History books only describe events in detail and don&rsquo;t tell us what was going on within the minds of the people involved. Although the Scarlet Witch ended up being called the &lsquo;Worst Witch in the World&rsquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmother cast her eyes down, put in a huge dollop of honey into her milk coffee, and while mixing it in with a spoon, she whispered, as though sharing a secret.</p>

<p> &ldquo;It seemed that witch merely had an impossible love.&rdquo;</p>

<p> That was the first time I heard of that, and I, who was stuffing my mouth with cookies, stopped my hand.</p>

<p>I had heard that the Scarlet Witch was a witch who got what she wanted at all costs. But was there something she couldn&rsquo;t obtain?</p>

<p>And then at that moment, I remembered. The language of flowers for anemones, which I had picked earlier and were just now displayed in a vase right at the middle of the table&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you have to return home soon. Your father and mother may be hands-off in regards to you, but Godwin will start to worry if you are late in returning. He is our loyal retainer who served the O&rsquo;Drielle family since the previous generation. Please treat him well. Lad, grow bigger soon so you can let that elderly man retire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...As you wish, Madam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, here is the herbal and salt toothpaste. For a magician, your teeth are your life. If there is anything else magic-related you don&rsquo;t understand, come and ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! Thank you very much, Grandmother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also...take good care of that basket. It is a legacy of the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch&rsquo;, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmother informed me that in my ear, like she was telling me another secret.</p>

<p>She always smelled of salt and herbs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>While we had Grandmother&rsquo;s dove guide our way back, I continued to ponder worriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, milady? Your face looks scarier than usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Thor. Have you ever been in love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor looked puzzled at my sudden question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love isn&rsquo;t allowed for slaves, so there&rsquo;s no way I have. Oh, but there were quite a few ladies who were devoted to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>...This devilish twelve-year-old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Thor. When we get home, let&rsquo;s make magical tools with the things we got today, okay? We&rsquo;ll make a ring for you with the tears of the Salt Forest, and make coats out of the blue dragonfly&rsquo;s wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love is a long way off for you too, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For us, it was still magic over love.</p>

<p>But, I remembered it completely now. The red anemone&rsquo;s meaning in the language of flowers.</p>

<p> I love you.</p>

<p>That was the &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; of an impossible love.</p>
