<h2>Chapter 2: The Arisaka Sisters</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Visiting my girlfriend’s house—especially when her family wasn’t home. Alone in her room.</p>



<p><em>“Would you like to come over to my place? Nobody’s home today.”</em></p>



<p>Yorka’s words echoed in my mind repeatedly. It was hard not to get carried away with the possibilities that might await beyond that invitation. </p>



<p><em>Okay, this is getting dangerous. </em></p>



<p>It was way beyond just the excitement of a first kiss. Could this be a chance to level up as a man? My imagination ran wild, conjuring up scenarios that hadn’t even happened yet. But instead of escalating excitement, it oddly calmed me down.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, you’ve been quiet since we got on the train.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Have I?”</p>



<p>“Are you feeling okay? Want some water?”</p>



<p>“Sure, thanks.”</p>



<p>I took the bottle from Yorka and gulped it down in one go.</p>



<p>“Oh…” Yorka let out a small gasp as I finished off the bottle.</p>



<p>“Sorry. I drank most of it.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay, but… um…”</p>



<p>“But?”</p>



<p>“We just had an indirect kiss,” Yorka said timidly.</p>



<p>The train rattled along as we headed towards Yorka’s local station. It all felt surreal. I’d sooner believe I’d passed out from heat stroke during our date and dreamed this than accept it as reality. That was how floaty I felt. </p>



<p>During today’s date, I was still fretting about not having kissed her yet. But now, with her unexpected proposition on the way home, I was totally unprepared.</p>



<p>I wished I could ask my more experienced classmate Nanamura for advice over LINE right now, but my right hand was holding Yorka’s, making it impossible to operate my phone.</p>



<p>“Are you nervous?” Yorka leaned her head on my shoulder and asked with a bashful glance.</p>



<p>Why was it that nervousness seemed to transmit so easily to others? Since Yorka already knew, trying to act cool would just be lame.</p>



<p>“To be honest, I’m freaking out. I got hit with a line I’ve always wanted to hear from my girlfriend right at the end of our date. It’s like reaching the pinnacle of happiness.”</p>



<p>“Really? For someone who’s nervous, you seem pretty happy.”</p>



<p>“I am happy, but I’m also nervous. Want to listen to my heartbeat? It’s like a summer festival in here.”</p>



<p>“I don’t quite get it, but I can tell you’re excited.” Yorka smiled. Her hand was cold to the touch, and it wasn’t just from air conditioning inside the train.</p>



<p>“Thanks for mustering up the courage, Yorka. I’m really, genuinely happy. Today was so much fun, I didn’t want it to end.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I feel the same way. That’s why I invited you.”</p>



<p>As if to express her reluctance to let go, Yorka squeezed my hand slightly.</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>“Don’t just suddenly go silent.”</p>



<p>“I’m just savoring happiness. You’ve become more proactive lately.”</p>



<p>“The way you say that is intriguing.”</p>



<p>“I’m praising you. Because you’re shy, it’s a big deal that you’re able to express your desires.”</p>



<p>That unattainable girl who wasn’t good at communication and didn’t trust others had changed a lot. If our relationship was contributing to her growth, then it was a win-win for us.</p>



<p>“I’m glad. I was worried it might be improper for a girl to make the first move.”</p>



<p>“That’s not true. We’re equals in a relationship. And I’m head over heels for you, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I love you too.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s answer, accompanied by a smile, showed no signs of excessive nervousness from before we started dating. She effortlessly turned her thoughts into words with a natural ease.</p>



<p>“Being treated specially by you is the best. It’s amazing to be wanted by the girl you like.”</p>



<p>“Since we’ll be busy with final exams soon, we won’t be able to go on dates for a while. I just wanted to spend a little more time together today.”</p>



<p>Just the fact that she felt that way made me happy.</p>



<p>“You should have no problem with exams, right?”</p>



<p>“I’m worried about you. I’d feel bad if your grades dropped because of me.”</p>



<p>Her consideration was really adorable.</p>



<p>“We should study together before the exams again. We had that big study session with the Sena Club last time, but this time, let’s do it just the two of us. With you teaching me, it’ll be like having a hundred people helping.”</p>



<p>During the midterm exams, we had a big study session with our close friends, the Sena Club. Yorka, who had been consistently at the top of the class since entering school, was really good at teaching. Thanks to her, I significantly improved my test scores.</p>



<p>This time, since we were lovers, I wanted to learn from her thoroughly in a one-on-one setting.</p>



<p>“That’s not possible. No way. I can’t do it.”</p>



<p>“Why not?”</p>



<p>What did she mean by saying no to studying together when she was inviting me over to her house?</p>



<p>“I just don’t think I can concentrate on studying when we’re together,” Yorka said, avoiding eye contact.</p>



<p><em>Man, is my girlfriend an adorable alien from a cute star? How can I protect this precious being forever?</em></p>



<p>Despite her cool outward impression, she was quite the spoiled one. Regardless of what she said, she enjoyed our interactions.</p>



<p>“Well, you do have a point.”</p>



<p>Once we were alone in a room with no one else around, I also felt like flirting with Yorka as usual. From now on, just hugging might not be enough.</p>



<p>“In that case, let’s consider today an extension of our date.”</p>



<p>Yorka and I, as deeply in love as ever, continued our romantic bliss for another day.</p>



<p>Instead of just seeing Yorka off at the station as usual, today, for the first time, we got off together.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>We passed through the ticket gates of the station where Yorka lived and started walking.</p>



<p>“Is it far from here?”</p>



<p>“It’s right there. You can see it already.”</p>



<p>True to her words, her high-rise apartment was conveniently close to the station.</p>



<p>“This is where I live.”</p>



<p>“Tall and glamorous. You’re not pulling my leg, are you?” I expressed my thoughts honestly. It looked expensive both physically and monetarily.</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t do something so convoluted. Come on, let’s go.”</p>



<p>Yorka pulled me along.</p>



<p>We passed through the auto-locked door, barely sparing a glance at the expansive lobby reminiscent of a luxury hotel, and boarded the elevator.</p>



<p>The elevator was too big for just the two of us.</p>



<p>The control panel displayed not only the underground parking lot, but also amenities like a gym and a working space exclusive to residents. The floor numbers steadily increased on the monitor.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, are you afraid of heights?”</p>



<p>Perhaps feeling relaxed on her home turf, Yorka teased me as I fidgeted nervously.</p>



<p>“No, I don’t have acrophobia or anything like that, so don’t worry.”</p>



<p>“That’s good to hear. You’ll enjoy the night view from my room; it’s beautiful.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be looking forward to it,” I managed to reply in a stiff voice.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, there’s no one to meet anyway. My parents work overseas, and my sister is in university.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s parents worked overseas, mainly in North America. Currently, she lived in this Tokyo apartment with her sister. Her sister was a college student majoring in science and often spent nights in the lab due to her experiments and assignments. Her irregular schedules mean they didn’t see each other every day.</p>



<p>“I’m not so sure about that. Even when you came to my house, Ei was there.”</p>



<p>I brought up the time when Yorka visited the Sena residence in April as a joke. I went to get a bath towel from the changing room to dry off after getting caught in sudden rain. And there, I accidentally ran into Ei who had just finished bathing. It was a complete surprise for me. Moreover, Yorka somehow mistook her for my cheating partner.</p>



<p>“Because I heard your sister is in elementary school. I never imagined Ei-chan would look so mature.”</p>



<p>“That really caught me off guard.”</p>



<p>“Nothing could surprise me more than that,” Yorka said, naturally cuddling up to my arm. Though she might not realize it, her ample bosom pressed against my arm.</p>



<p>“Your soothing effect is unparalleled. I wish I could have it in the classroom too.”</p>



<p>“Don’t get ahead of yourself.”</p>



<p>“You’re being stingy, Yorka. No need to hold back.”</p>



<p>“I have my manners. I’m different from you, Kisumi,” Yorka laughed while giving me a gentle warning.</p>



<p>Since publicly declaring ourselves as a couple, her emotional expression had truly flourished. This was so different from last year, where she had been reserved and spoke little to maintain her distance from others. </p>



<p>It made me happy to see her showing various expressions like this. Being the only one who got to see a side of her that even our classmates didn’t know was incredibly fulfilling.</p>



<p>During our first year of high school, I harbored feelings for Yorka, who had avoided communication with others for almost a year. Finally, I mustered up the courage to confess, only to have her run away in a panic. It wasn’t until the first day of our second year that we officially started dating.</p>



<p>We kept it a secret at first, and it almost ended before it truly began when it seemed like someone might discover our relationship.</p>



<p>But after many twists and turns, we finally became an acknowledged couple after I publicly declared her as my girlfriend. Even then, it took some time before we could go on our first date due to various circumstances, like being confessed to by another girl.</p>



<p>As I was reflecting on the intense yet fleeting time we had spent together, I thought about how much had happened. And today, I had finally come to Yorka’s house.</p>



<p>“Excuse me.”</p>



<p>After passing through a long hallway, the spacious living room that boasted the magnificent view I had heard about was greeting us. A panoramic view of Tokyo’s sparkling night skyline unfolded from the large windows.</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by the dazzling panorama, I could only stand in awe.</p>



<p>“I’ll make some tea. Make yourself at home, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>After confirming that Yorka’s presence had faded towards the kitchen, I took a deep breath.</p>



<p>This turned out to be a more romantic situation than I expected.</p>



<p>The summer dusk transitioned from orange to a beautiful purple hue.</p>



<p>Could we really spend such a sweet time alone together in this luxurious space? My heart raced uncontrollably.</p>



<p>The sofa in the middle of the room was quite large, big enough for a family of four to sit comfortably with room to spare. It was no wonder a two-seater sofa would look too small for Yorka.</p>



<p>While waiting, I tried to distract myself by looking out the window at the scenery. But my anticipation only grew, and I couldn’t calm down. I hesitated to sit on the expensive-looking sofa and felt restless.</p>



<p>When I nervously scanned the room, I noticed movement on the sofa. I had never heard anything about Yorka having pets. <em>What could it be?</em></p>



<p>I cautiously circled around to the front of the sofa. There, a mysterious object covered in a blanket, Object X, was revealed. It had been hidden in the shadow of the backrest, unnoticed until now.</p>



<p>“What is it? Is it a person?”</p>



<p><em>Who?</em></p>



<p>It was unlikely that a thief would be napping in a high-security high-rise apartment. That meant the person lying on the living room sofa must be one of the residents in this house.</p>



<p>“No way.”</p>



<p>With a sense of dread creeping over me, I pondered how to deal with Object X hiding under the blanket. Yorka couldn’t possibly arrange a surprise to scare me, she probably didn’t know there was anyone here.</p>



<p>Suddenly, my gaze fell to some scattered clothes on the floor. But before I could understand the significance of it, the blanket-covered object sensed my approach and sprang up with a start.</p>



<p>“Welcome home, Yor-chan! I’m starving to death!”</p>



<p>“Wha—!?”</p>



<p>Before I could even scream in surprise, the Object X fell on top of me.</p>



<p>Too shocked to scream, I was tackled by Object X and knocked to the floor. Before I could even register the pain, a mysterious soft object was pressed against my face, making it hard to breathe.</p>



<p>I quickly pushed away the elastic object clinging to my face.</p>



<p>I heard a strangely seductive “Ahh” voice.</p>



<p>“W-What’s going on!?”</p>



<p>Finally securing my line of sight, I noticed something squirming beneath the blanket.</p>



<p>“Yor-chan is naughty! Oh, it’s kind of rough. Why?”</p>



<p>I was too terrified to move. The object X crawling over my chest muttered in a drowsy voice.</p>



<p>“Mmm, where are your boobs? And the butt, here?”</p>



<p>With no hesitation, she began groping my entire body.</p>



<p>“I-I’m not Yorka!”</p>



<p>Feeling endangered, I protested.</p>



<p>Her movements abruptly stopped, and the blanket covering her face fell away, revealing the person underneath.</p>



<p>It was like being struck by lightning. When one saw an object that pierced their sense of vanity, time seemed to elongate.</p>



<p>What appeared was a beautiful woman with a striking resemblance to Yorka. Because I was so familiar with my girlfriend’s face, I was acutely aware of the differences.</p>



<p>She appeared to be in her early twenties. Long hair, large eyes, thick lashes, well-shaped eyebrows, a high nose bridge, and mesmerizing lips—all harmoniously balanced within her small face.</p>



<p>Her natural beauty, unadorned by makeup, was utterly captivating. Unlike Yorka’s innocence, this woman’s beauty was prominently displayed.</p>



<p>To put it plainly, she was really stunning.</p>



<p>When our eyes met, I felt like I recognized that gaze. However, I couldn’t recall where we had met before.</p>



<p>“…Who are you?”</p>



<p>The bewitching beauty stared back at me with a sleepy expression.</p>



<p>“That’s my line!?”</p>



<p>Seemingly still half-asleep, she might not fully grasp my words. Moreover, why wasn’t she feeling any alarm or embarrassment in this situation? She was far too defenseless.</p>



<p>“Hey, haven’t we met somewhere before?” She peered at me with drowsy eyes, as though trying to see right through me.</p>



<p>This woman seemed to recognize me just as I recognized her. If she resembled Yorka, there was no way I could forget her.</p>



<p>While I wanted to know who she was, the situation was dire.</p>



<p>“Um, could you please back off for a moment!?”</p>



<p>Trapped beneath the blanket with this woman on top of me, I pleaded.</p>



<p>“Wait. Just a bit longer. I feel like I’m about to remember something.”</p>



<p>“Could you at least consider doing that somewhere else!?”</p>



<p>I didn’t know if she wasn’t hearing me due to drowsiness or she was too preoccupied retracing her memories to notice. But how could she be so nonchalant when she was straddling a guy and pondering like that?</p>



<p>What an abnormal situation to be in when visiting your girlfriend’s house for the first time, only to have a different woman straddle you.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I felt like I had a clue about the only person who could possibly act so boldly.</p>



<p>“Oh, I got it! You’re Sumi-kun, right?”</p>



<p>Apparently she had found the answer. The woman, now wide awake, beamed with joy.</p>



<p>“Well, my name is indeed Kisumi, but…”</p>



<p>I was thrown off guard by her sudden use of my name, and it felt oddly nostalgic.</p>



<p>“You’re Sena Kisumi. Yep, I totally remembered. It’s been a while, how have you been?”</p>



<p>The woman, satisfied with her conclusion, nodded as though we casually exchanged greetings after passing each other on the street. No, this was definitely weird!</p>



<p>“W-why do you know my name?” I cautiously probed her identity.</p>



<p>“Huh? You don’t remember me? We had such a passionate time together,” she said, dropping such suggestive lines, but I had no recollection whatsoever.</p>



<p>Humans tend to be more frightened than thrilled when faced with unexpectedly lucky situations. To be the protagonist of a romcom who could nonchalantly enjoy this situation was way too dangerous.</p>



<p>“Who… are you?”</p>



<p>“Do you still not remember? Let me give you a hint, then. Who helped you pass the entrance exam for Eisei High? Who was it?”</p>



<p>The word ‘exam’ triggered a sudden recollection of trauma I had tried to bury, causing my body to tremble involuntarily.</p>



<p>“No way… It couldn’t be…”</p>



<p>The person I remembered from the past didn’t quite match up with this Yorka look-alike.</p>



<p>The tutor I had in cram school, who helped me get into Eisei High, was not someone stylish or glamorous. Always disheveled, had messy hair, casual attire, glasses, and a mask. Come to think of it, I couldn’t recall ever seeing her face clearly.</p>



<p>“Oh, come on, Sumi-kun, don’t play dumb. Have you really forgotten our days at Nisshu Juku in front of the station?”</p>



<p>However, putting aside the difference in appearance, her assertiveness and cheerfulness unmistakably identified her as my tutor.</p>



<p>Nisshu Juku was the name of the cram school I attended during junior high to prepare for high school entrance exams. Thanks to the Spartan tutoring I received there, I managed to pass the entrance exam for Eisei High.</p>



<p>The name of the teacher who had helped me so much was Arisaka.</p>



<p>My girlfriend was Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>And the name of the woman here was—</p>



<p>“Arisaka… Aria-san?”</p>



<p>In a moment of uncanny coincidence, I confirmed it once more with a trembling voice.</p>



<p>“A-Are you really Aria-san? Um, the, uh, Dreadful Demon Queen?”</p>



<p>The old nickname from my past slipped out unintentionally.</p>



<p>From our first encounter, with her mask, white coat, and plain clothes underneath, she was a modest-looking cram school tutor. She had greeted the students with an absolute declaration of obedience from day one. I never forgot that moment.</p>



<p><em>“Alright, I’ll grant your wish. Just call me Aria-san casually. Let’s get along, shall we? Oh, but if you don’t listen to me, I’ll give you more assignments without mercy. If you want to pass, you better be prepared to work yourself to death.”</em></p>



<p>At first, I was skeptical of the cheerful arrogance of the mysterious cram school tutor who hardly ever showed her face. But her teaching prowess was undeniable.</p>



<p>“Calling me the Dreadful Demon Queen is a bit rude, don’t you think? I just gave you assignments to help you pass. But it’s good to see you again. Sumi-kun, you’ve grown up.”</p>



<p>My former tutor, Arisaka Aria, was reminiscing deeply.</p>



<p>“Um, your last name is Arisaka, right? You must be Yorka’s…”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’m Yor-chan’s big sister.”</p>



<p>With a cool demeanor, she introduced herself on top of me, leaving me utterly perplexed. Why couldn’t this person ever engage in normal conversation? Always assertive, she effortlessly pulled everyone into her pace.</p>



<p>She seemed pleased with our reunion and casually patted my head as if to say, ‘Well done.’</p>



<p>I still couldn’t hide my unease. The shocking revelation that the fearsome Demon Queen was Yorka’s actual sister had left me reeling.</p>



<p>“You remember my name pretty well.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t a boast, but I wasn’t particularly memorable. I was plain and unremarkable, lacking any standout features. That’s why I tend to fade into the background and easily forgotten by others.</p>



<p>It had been about two years since I last saw Aria-san, and I was just one of many students at the cram school. I hadn’t expected her to remember me.</p>



<p>“Well, Sumi-kun was a student I poured my heart into teaching.”</p>



<p>“Is that why I was bullied?”</p>



<p>“You mean passionate guidance.”</p>



<p>“Is that what it was?” </p>



<p>Recalling the past, I grimaced.</p>



<p>“By the way, why are you here? Do you come to steal something?” </p>



<p>“As if! I just stopped by after a date with Yorka.”</p>



<p>“…Sumi-kun is really Yor-chan’s boyfriend?”</p>



<p>Huh? Something about her reaction just seemed off. I tried to ponder the source of this discordance.</p>



<p>“Hmm, aren’t you a bit nervous, Sumi-kun? Could it be that you’re excited to see me?”</p>



<p>“I’m not so mature as to be calm in this situation!”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s deliberately provocative words derailed my thoughts.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, what’s all the fuss about—”</p>



<p>Yorka returned to check on me, only to be struck speechless as though witnessing the end of the world.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Yor-chan.”</p>



<p>By the time I understood the significance of the clothes scattered by the sofa, it was too late.</p>



<p>When Aria-san raised her hand, the blanket she had been wearing slipped off her shoulders. She was wearing underwear underneath.</p>



<p>They truly shared the same DNA. Moreover, her breast was even more impressive than Yorka’s.</p>



<p>“A-Aria-neechan, why are you here?” Yorka’s expression tightened, her voice trembling. It seemed she wasn’t aware of her sister’s return, “You said you weren’t coming home today, right?”</p>


<p>“My experiment got postponed due to some trouble. Since I had nothing else to do, I came back.”</p>



<p>What was meant to be a secretive rendezvous with a lover turned into an unexpected encounter. It was hell. Yorka’s audacious act had suddenly been exposed to a family member, and she was on the verge of bursting with embarrassment.</p>



<p>“And what exactly are you doing?”</p>



<p>To add to the confusion, her sister was in her underwear, pinning down her boyfriend in the living room.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, Yor-chan’s boyfriend is Sumi-kun, right? It’s such a crazy coincidence that my former student ended up dating my sister! And Sumi-kun, even though I share the same last name as Yor-chan, you didn’t realize I was her sister! Hilarious. You haven’t changed since middle school, have you? Still a bit clueless, and a bit careless too.”</p>



<p>Arisaka Aria, Yorka’s sister, was oddly cheerful as she spoke on top of me.</p>



<p>“Come on, onee-chan, get off Kisumi! Why are you on him?”</p>



<p>“I thought I’d surprise Yor-chan, but it turned out to be Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>Surprising someone by tackling them to the ground wasn’t the best idea, in my opinion.</p>



<p>“And put some clothes on!”</p>



<p>“I’m always like this anyway.”</p>



<p>“But Kisumi’s here now!”</p>



<p>Apparently, Aria-san lounging around in her underwear was a regular occurrence. The four-year-older sister had a much more laid-back approach to life than Yorka.</p>



<p>Yorka’s excellent housekeeping skills were probably honed from living with this easygoing sister.</p>



<p>“If you’re going to sleep, do it in your own room! And stop leaving your clothes all over the floor.”</p>



<p>“I’m not completely naked, so it’s fine.” Aria-san casually adjusted her loosened blanket and moved off me. I swiftly got up and retreated to the corner by the window.</p>



<p>“That’s totally disaster! It’s harmful to Kisumi’s eyes! Do you have any shame?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I have anything to be ashamed of. There’s nothing to lose. Besides, why not hear his opinion?” </p>



<p>With those words, Aria-san confidently rose from the sofa and dramatically tossed aside the blanket. Her body, a physical embodiment of confidence, boasted a slender yet curvaceous figure.</p>



<p>Her artistic proportions, rivaling those of a marble sculpture, were boldly exposed to me without hesitation.</p>



<p>“Why are you being like this!?”</p>



<p>“It’s obviously wrong! You’re too bold, onee-chan!”</p>



<p>Ignoring our dismayed voices, Aria-san was unfazed. She appeared to lack the crucial process of considering the other person’s opinions.</p>



<p>For her, her own desires took top priority, and there was no hesitation in her words or actions. She left those around her scrambling to respond.</p>



<p>Yorka promptly covered her sister with the blanket.</p>



<p>“Did you see anything?” Yorka glared at me as if trying to shoot lasers from her eyes. Her gaze was too intense.</p>



<p>“I’ve already erased it from my memory!”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“I confessed the last time I saw something like this!”</p>



<p>Memories of this time last year come flooding back.</p>



<p>It was the day I first stepped into the art prep room. In an attempt to shield Yorka from falling artwork, I accidentally ended up knocking her over. Feeling enraged, Yorka retaliated with a fierce kick against the wall, resulting in an unexpected glimpse beneath her skirt. That audacious sight remained vividly etched in my mind.</p>



<p>…I promised to forget about that day, but it was still fresh in my memory. Sorry.</p>



<p>These sisters had left indelible marks on my life with their unforgettable moments.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s true,” Yorka conceded almost reluctantly to my reckless retort.</p>



<p>“Wow, you’ve seen Yor-chan’s underwear? Way to go, boyfriend!” </p>



<p>“That’s not it!”</p>



<p>“It was an accident!”</p>



<p>Yorka and I hastily denied.</p>



<p>“I’ll keep it a secret from Mom and Dad that you brought your boyfriend over while they were gone. Don’t worry, even if you come home late, I won’t say a word,” Aria-san chuckled with a hint of implication, eyeing us.</p>



<p>“Enough. Go change in your room! Right now!”</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, don’t leave just yet. I have a favor to ask you.”</p>



<p>“Got it, but please go quickly,” I joined in, urging her to leave.</p>



<p>Yorka forcefully escorted Aria-san out of the living room.</p>



<p>The realization that my girlfriend’s sister was none other than my middle school tutor hit me like a ton of bricks.</p>



<p>I was left dumbfounded by this reunion, completely unaware that Aria-san’s “favor” would soon bring such an incredibly complicated situation to us.</p>
