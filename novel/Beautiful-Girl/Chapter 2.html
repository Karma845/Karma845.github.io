<h1>Interlude 2: Jet Coaster Romance</h1>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, this must be what they call to be won over by someone’s cooking.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Returning from the room next door to my own room, 103, I lay down on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Resting both hands on my satisfied stomach, I felt a gentle sense of happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was my fourth time eating at his place, and it was already becoming something I couldn’t do without.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Somehow, it feels like he’s the older one.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi-kun, who welcomed me, had prepared dinner according to our Neighbor Agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A delicious dinner with a well-thought-out nutritional balance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m very grateful for the fish dish, which I wouldn’t eat unless I made some effort.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The quality of his first attempt exceeded my expectations, and I was very satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I checked the time on my smartphone as I was leaving, it was much later than I had thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, I would have already been fast asleep by now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess I got relaxed in next door for quite a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m not usually comfortable eating with someone I’m not close with.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After finishing the meal, I should have left, but instead, we ended up chatting while watching TV.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His room is so comfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Despite having the same layout, I feel much more at ease there than in my own room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Strange things do happen.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since I started eating with Yuunagi-kun, I’ve felt a bit more at ease.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Beyond the physical help with housework, it’s made me feel lighter mentally.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Maybe this is what it’s like to live together with someone else.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just spending time together in his room felt surprisingly fun.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No-no, he’s a student and of the opposite sex!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I immediately denied the thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He’s wiser and more composed than I was at his age, making me almost forget he’s younger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi-kun is also a good listener, so I end up doing most of the talking. I guess I feel refreshed by having someone to talk to while eating.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if a normal man and woman would start dating after visiting each other’s houses like this…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Lying in bed and staring at the ceiling, I feel my face getting hotter with each word.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I writhe on the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Snap out of it! You’re being too careless, Reiyu Tenjō! Even if you have no experience in love, remember, he’s younger and, moreover, a student of yours! Don’t get carried away with your fantasies!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I started berating myself, all my repressed feelings burst out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Besides, he’s too perfect! Waiting for me to come home with dinner ready, wearing an apron? That’s too diligent. Is he a loyal dog or what!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Here I am, trying to hide my nervousness by forcing myself to be excited and even buying things for both of us to keep the conversation going.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I intended to show some adult composure when I went to his room, but before I knew it, I was the one being healed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’d hate it if he saw right through me…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Feeling like I’m being played in the palm of a younger boy’s hand is incredibly embarrassing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If this is what love is, it’s happening too fast for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s like I’ve been put on a jet coaster without a safety bar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t even know where it’s heading, and it’s departing without giving me time to prepare</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though we knew each other as teacher and student, what exactly is our relationship, coming and going to each other’s homes and having meals together?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to find an answer myself, I ended up calling a friend as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, I got no response today.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s all your fault for telling me to be more assertive, and now look what’s happened…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just because I shared something with my neighbor, my life has changed drastically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At school and at home, a boy named Yuunagi Nishiki is close to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And when he’s close, I can’t help but be conscious of him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No good, I need a change of mood! I’ll hang up my swimsuit, take a shower, and prepare for class!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I got up from the bed, it was past eleven at night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After hanging up my competitive swimsuit that I wore for today’s club activities, I head to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I really wanted to soak in the tub, but I settled for a shower.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After freshening up and changing into pajamas, I drank some water and picked up the hairdryer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Drying long hair takes time and can be bothersome.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I slack off, my hair gets damaged, which lowers my spirits, so as a matter of pride for a girl, I can’t cut corners here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After drying my hair, I thought I saw a black shadow moving in the corner of my vision.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kyaaaaaa───────!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Instantly, the silhouette of that black, hated presence flashed across my mind, and I let out a loud scream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I quickly covered my mouth with both hands, trying to suppress the noise, and hastily expelled the dark image from my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Squinting fearfully, I checked the floor and corners of the room, but there was no sign of anything.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a mistake! Yes, definitely just a mistake!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I kept desperately praying that nothing would happen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the room’s intercom rang.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Could it be Yuunagi-kun?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t think of anyone else visiting at this late hour.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just in case, I put on a cardigan and headed to the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Killing my presence, I peeked through the door’s peephole, and sure enough, he was standing there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I opened the door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong, Yuunagi-kun, at this hour?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought I heard something like a scream from Tenjō-san. Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry, I was just a little startled. Thanks for coming all the way here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Neighbor Agreement Clause 2: In times of trouble, we help each other without hesitation. It’s fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…You came before I even asked for help.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s nice to think that someone cares about you.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was worried you might be crying again.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi-kun brushed it off with a joke as if to say not to worry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry if I woke you up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was just doing my homework.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, is it my fault that I’m keeping you up at night? “</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve been staying up this late even before, so don’t misunderstand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You won’t grow taller if you don’t sleep enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think I’ve stopped growing in height by now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He smiled, yet he was a head taller than me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, I thought of him as a boy, but this makes me realize he’s indeed a man.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, I felt embarrassed about my attire and pressed the front of my cardigan with my hands.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you going to sleep yet, Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was thinking of preparing a little for tomorrow’s class.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re always working hard.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He said, seemingly genuinely impressed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So are you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Since I’m here, should I make some late-night snacks?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s tempting, but I’ll pass to avoid gaining weight. I appreciate your concern, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then let’s both finish what we have to do and go to bed early.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right, let’s do our best. See you tomorrow then. Good night.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, good night.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I watched Yuunagi-kun return to his room and then closed my door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I just barely managed to stop myself from grinning in front of him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I honestly thought that it was not so bad to encourage each other like this.</p>
