<p><h2>Chapter 7: The Search for the Failed Student </h2></p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4></p>

<p>Three weeks have passed since I started school. The first year students are mainly taking classes in the following subjects.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirit Magic Studies&rdquo; &#8230;. Instructor: Yuri Ulysses Le Ruschia</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elements Magic Studies&rdquo; &#8230;. Multiple instructors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Potions&rdquo; &#8230;. Instructor: Urbanus Medite</p>

<p>&ldquo;History of the Magical World&rdquo; &#8230;. Instructor: Mary Erlich</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magical Athletics&rdquo; &#8230;. Instructor: Francesca Lila</p>

<p></p>

<p>These foundational magical studies were included in the curriculum, and students could then take general education courses they were interested in to earn credits for advancement.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First, about &ldquo;Spirit Magic Studies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spirit Magic Studies is an important class to learn about &lsquo;spirit magic,&rsquo; which originated in the Kingdom of Ruschia. It consisted of spirit biology, summoning, the art of magic circle creation, and so on. It is a specialized magic that is needed to develop and protect our country to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instructor was His Highness, Yuri Ulysses Le Ruschia, who also helped us with the spirit summoning ceremony.</p>

<p>He was the second prince of Ruschia, renowned for being the strongest spirit magician in the kingdom, and was said to have more than ten Great Spirits in his service. He had a boyish face and looked young, but he had a composed demeanour and his love for spirits came through in every class, so I respected him greatly.</p>

<p>Next, &ldquo;Elements Magic Studies,&rdquo; which is the foundation of all magic.</p>

<p>The main elements were&#12304;Fire&#12305;, &#12304;Water&#12305;, &#12304;Ice&#12305;, &#12304;Earth&#12305;, &#12304;Flora&#12305;, &#12304;Wind&#12305;, &#12304;Thunder&#12305;, &#12304;Sound&#12305;, &#12304;Light&#12305;, and&#12304;Darkness&#12305;. This was a class where you learned more about these kinds of magic and use them for the applications of offensive and defensive magic by learning how to use them correctly. Each element had its own teacher, and this was the class with the most number of time blocks in the first-year curriculum. It was important to first know which elements you were strong and weak at. By the way, for me, I was of course good at&#12304;Fire&#12305;and extremely weak with&#12304;Water&#12305;.</p>

<p>Next was &ldquo;Potions,&rdquo; which was inseparable from the development of Ruschia.</p>

<p>The instructor was my uncle, Professor Urbanus Medite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The development of our nation is based on poison and medicine. To put it simply, Potions is a class that trains the bearers of Ruschia&rsquo;s main industry. There are lots of field trips to gather medicinal herbs, so it takes a lot of physical strength~.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a class where you collected magical materials in the natural world and combined them with your own magic to create magical medicines that had various effects on the human body. In my first class, I learned that it was something developed from&#12304;Flora&#12305;, &#12304;Earth&#12305;, &#12304;Water&#12305;, and &#12304;Light&#12305;of Elemental Magic Studies.</p>

<p>The beauty of magic potions was that even if you weren&rsquo;t a magician, you could still benefit from them as long as you have access to them. Therefore, potions developed as an industry of this nation and have great value in each nation in Maydare. By the way, I&rsquo;ve been studying potions for all my life in the O&rsquo;Drielle house, so I could say that I was very good at it.</p>

<p>Next was &ldquo;History of the Magical World.&rdquo; This was a class where we learned the history of Maydare and about magic and great magicians through the ages.</p>

<p>The instructor was Professor Mary Erlich. She was an orthodox and stern witch in the prime of her life with shoulder-length hair, dressed in her characteristic wide-brimmed three-cornered hat and black robe dress. However, she also had the characteristic of not being able to stop talking about her husband, who was a royal magician, once she got going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maydare is a world of &lsquo;salvation,&rsquo; created by the ten gods. These gods are also called the &lsquo;primeval magicians.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beginning of history class meant that everything began with a myth. This class also included Maydare&rsquo;s creation mythology and Vabelist religious studies.</p>

<p>It was a class where we mainly sat at our desks indoors and listened to the professor&rsquo;s lecture, and devoted ourselves to memorizing the names of people and historical events, so there were many sleepy students.</p>

<p>Finally, for &ldquo;Magical Athletics,&rdquo; we mainly did physical exercise to gain basic physical strength, and we learned martial arts, swordsmanship, transference magic, levitation magic, and flight magic.</p>

<p>We also learned how to use major magical tools in this class, and apparently we would also soon be doing field training, mock battles, and dueling sessions using magic and magical tools. I heard that the grades for this class were important for those who were aiming to be magic soldiers or magic knights in the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magicians tended to be thought of as a reclusive and shady profession, but we now live in an age where there is a great demand for magicians who can move. Physical strength is a must! Any student who fails to get an A or higher in this &lsquo;Magical Athletics&rsquo; class will not get a referral for becoming a magic soldier or magic knight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The instructor was Professor Francesca Lila. While there were many orthodox magic teachers, this female teacher stood out with her yellow jersey and sunglasses. Her speech was rough and she was just plain spartan. Although she and Professor Erlich were often at odds over the direction of teaching, her new appointment to this school had resulted in more graduates who were physically fit.</p>

<p>In this way, under the watchful eye of these idiosyncratic teachers, we continued to work hard at our studies today.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;First-years, have you all gotten used to your school classes by now? Ah, the last class was Magical Athletics? No wonder you&rsquo;re all croaking~&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day in Potions class, Professor Medite was grinning at the slumped over students. We had just been made to run all over the island for basic physical training.</p>

<p>The students who didn&rsquo;t do a lot of fitness training seemed to have had a hard time. I ran everyday and worked out before I enrolled here, so this much was nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, while you rest, I&rsquo;ll explain the field training to pick medicinal herbs that will be happening next month~. It&rsquo;s fine to be exhausted, but turn your ears to me, at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Field training&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the students were listless, they seemed curious about the lesson the professor had mentioned. Professor Medite pushed up his monocle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone has already decided their teams, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone gulped.</p>

<p>The people who had already formed their teams looked relaxed, but the people who didn&rsquo;t looked pale...and so I was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The field training to pick medicinal herbs next month is the first team activity for the first-years. It will affect your marks greatly, so be sure to work hard. Ah, those who haven&rsquo;t applied to a team should hurry, as there&rsquo;s only one week left. If you can&rsquo;t gather team members, I&rsquo;ll be the one deciding for you. ...Now, let&rsquo;s start class. Open your textbooks to page 24. Hey, you over there, don&rsquo;t sleep!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle was a surprisingly diligent and serious teacher. The chalk he threw hit the sleeping boy right in the middle of his forehead, earning him a round of applause.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When class was over and left the classroom with Lapis, Beatrice ambushed me in the hallway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Makia O&rsquo;Drielle? I heard you still haven&rsquo;t gathered enough team members yet? That cannot be~.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said snidely as she lightly tossed her hair.</p>

<p>The people who seemed to be her team members were assembled around her.</p>

<p>They were all people who came from beautifully prestigious families and displayed their excellence in class.</p>

<p>Um, let me see, there were two of her noble girl followers, a boy who was also from the Asta family, and a boy who was a butler who served the Asta family. I still didn&rsquo;t remember any of their names.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and talk all you want. We&rsquo;re just keeping our members secret until the last minute. I have no interest in showing off my team members like a strap.&rdquo;*</p>

<p> (TN: The word used here is used to refer to key holders or phone straps that usually have cute mascot animals or anime characters attached to them. Now I'm pretty sure they don't have phones in this world and since the people here seem to know what she's talking about it must be the key holder then? Anyways I decided to keep it as it is)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&#8230;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her followers said things like &ldquo;Strap!? How rude!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Act tough while you still can!&rdquo;, but I tossed my head and left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, was it okay to say that? We still haven&rsquo;t gathered all our team members yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a bluff, a bluff. It&rsquo;s annoying how she keeps pestering me. Ah, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as Lapis said, we couldn&rsquo;t find the last team member no matter how hard we tried.</p>

<p>Probably because I had been at odds with Beatrice, but most of the girls were on her side.</p>

<p>There were many boys who put a lot of importance on the summoned spirit, so I, who summoned hamsters, was out of the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need to have a strategy meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we go to the atelier then? I believe Mr. Nero is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay, but can we stop by the herb garden on the way there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. What do you need?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elderflowers. I have a small order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An...order?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The school&rsquo;s herb garden was located high up on the island. Students at the school were free to pick about a hundred types of plants, some grown outdoors, some grown in greenhouses.</p>

<p>We searched for elderflowers here, picking beautiful ones with many small cream-colored flowers. Elderflowers were an all-purpose herb in the Sambucus genus that were popular with magicians since ancient times.</p>

<p>When Lapis and I came in carrying a large amount of elderflowers, Nero, who was being unusually absentminded by the glass wall of the atelier, blatantly wrinkled his brow and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making herb cordials with elderflowers. It&rsquo;s very witchy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herb cordials?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know them? It&rsquo;s herbal syrup. There are a lot of ways to use them when you make them in advance, such as diluting it in hot water and baking soda and drinking it, pouring it over yogurt or ice cream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a simple kitchen room in the basement of the glass bottle atelier.</p>

<p>The basement was a cool and closed-off room, suitable for the preparation and storage of potions and magical substances.</p>

<p>There, you could use the kitchen to boil water, simmer something or melt something.</p>

<p>I found a large bowl, washed it carefully, and soaked hot water, sugar and a bunch of elderflowers in it. I squeezed the lemons I picked at school thoroughly, along with some sliced lemons.</p>

<p>The elderflower was an herb that was typical of herb cordials.</p>

<p>Why was I making them? Yesterday, the head of the girls&rsquo; dorm, Cousin Nagie, asked me to make the O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s special herb cordial.</p>

<p>Cousin Nagie had always loved our family&rsquo;s herb cordials.</p>

<p>Also, elderflowers were a good guard against colds. It would soon be the season of the summer flu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll leave this in a cool place and soak it for three days. I&rsquo;m so lucky that you can pick as many lemons as you want in Lune Ruschia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put it away in a cooler box in the basement and finished the preparation.</p>

<p>When it was done, I would filter it through a cloth and store it in jars that had been disinfected with boiling water.</p>

<p>Lapis, who helped me, had arranged the leftover elderflowers in a vase and displayed them by the wall on the first floor. There were plenty of potted sunflowers blooming next to the wall with the big glass arch. They were grown by me, and I planned on turning the sunflower seeds into snacks for my ham-chans someday.</p>

<p>The blue sky that could be seen from the glass wall, the white columns of clouds along the horizon, and the sunflowers blooming in brilliant yellow in front of me gave me a premonition of this year&rsquo;s summer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, have you found the last team member?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero asked in his unfriendly voice when he saw that we had finished our work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I invited a bunch of people, but they&rsquo;re all assembling their own teams, so there&rsquo;s not much hope. ...Well, I&rsquo;m mainly the reason why, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that, Nero, with some hesitation, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one person...I don&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;ll be a member of our team, but I know a guy who hasn&rsquo;t been approached by anyone yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My roommate, Frey Levi. He&rsquo;s originally a year above us, but he failed a year, so he&rsquo;s in the same year as us. He didn&rsquo;t show up to the entrance ceremony and skipped all the classes, so there are a lot of people who don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh~, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A senior who&rsquo;s originally a year above us. And, he failed a year so now he&rsquo;s in our year&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, if he&rsquo;s a failed student, then he must be quite a problem child, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Towards Lapis&rsquo; worries, Nero said, &ldquo;I understand your worries, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s just a dropout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well...you&rsquo;ll understand when you see him. The two of you, come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He exited the atelier. Lapis and I followed him, not knowing what was going on.</p>

<p>In the pleasant sea breeze, we passed through the glass bottle ateliers and came out to an open area on the cliffs.</p>

<p>Nero raised his arm and whistled, and then a female hawk flying in the sky descended. As she did, the bells on her tail feathers tinkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, she&rsquo;s so lovely up close. What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name is...Fugue. Her element is&#12304;Sound&#12305;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s rare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero stroked the feathers of Fugue, who was nipping at his hair and playing with it, and then released her into the sky again.</p>

<p>He seemed to have already developed a relationship of mutual trust with his spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently, Frey Levi will be in this area soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was that information from Fugue?</p>

<p>We stayed there for a while, and then a male student appeared at the quiet beach right below us.</p>

<p>It was that aforementioned Frey Levi. He was humming with his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>He had slender and long legs, a slight hunchback, ash-green hair with the ends flipped up, pierced ears, and a casually worn uniform. His drooping eyes, arched eyebrows, and narrow-jawed face seemed like they would be popular with girls around his age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, he looks like a delinquent or a playboy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he was actually serious on the inside, then he would be the type to get a high rating for gap moe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Makia, a female student arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a third-year. Her ribbon&rsquo;s green.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Makia, they&rsquo;re flirting on the beach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I can&rsquo;t watch anymore&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I, being pure, was about to cover my eyes with my hand, when&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another girl arrived at the beach. She had a demonic expression on her face, leaning forward and walking fast. She had a yellow ribbon, so she was a fourth-year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, looks like relationship trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that Frey Levi was two-timing those seniors.</p>

<p>The two female seniors began to get into a catfight concerning that man.</p>

<p>By the way, what do you think happened to the person concerned, Frey Levi?</p>

<p>That rascal lightly ran up the cliff with his hands still in his pockets and ran away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. He&rsquo;s blessed by&#12304;Earth&#12305;. A special constitution where he&rsquo;s loved by the earth...he&rsquo;s scum, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the enemy of women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis and I said this and that, and Nero seemed like he wanted to run away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should we do? He&rsquo;s probably the type women hate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m rather glad that I got to see how fast he can run away. Let&rsquo;s scout Frey Levi. That agility can be made use of for field training especially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, we decided to look for Frey Levi.</p>

<p>We had Fugue the hawk search in the sky, and apparently he escaped to outside the school. We also ended up having to go outside school to search for the failed student.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center">2</h4></p>

<p>As we ran around the streets of Miladriede in our uniforms, many people called out to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re selling some nice iron pots! Your potions will never fail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The latest trend in robes is going back to the basics and wearing black. It was deep green a while ago though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like some wand polish? Oh, are students wearing rings these days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so on and so forth. Since the royal capital was a place where many magicians tended to gather, there were many businesses that catered to them.</p>

<p>We lost sight of Frey midway.</p>

<p>There were a lot of people, but it was also a city with many waterways, so if you went back and forth between similar-looking bridges and complex alleyways, you would end up not knowing where you were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be quicker if we split up and search. If one of us finds him, we&rsquo;ll communicate with our spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; &ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that, we split up at the central square where the road divided into three. I was walking down the main street in the middle when I saw Frey Levi walk into the galleria, so I followed him. The galleria was a shopping district with an arched glass ceiling high overhead, and it was crowded with people today, as always.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really...even in a place like this, that man is still calmly walking on the walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowds didn&rsquo;t seem to bother Frey Levi. He ignored gravity and walked with his feet clinging to the building&rsquo;s walls and ceiling. So his constitution was effective against things that were attached to the earth. In combination with the crowd, the man&rsquo;s constitution seemed to create an optical illusion, and I felt like I was drunk.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I passed through the galleria, Frey Levi was already far far away from me, entering a narrow alleyway. I ran after him while feeling disheartened, but I lost sight of him.</p>

<p>And just when I went around the alleys in circles and thought I lost my way, I bumped into someone at a corner and fell onto my backside hard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ow ow ow&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, are you okay, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nero!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amazingly, I met up with Nero here. I let him pull me up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The capital&rsquo;s terrifying. Crowds are scary. I want to go back to the countryside&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;ve received the baptism of the city. Well, I get how you feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero, while more or less sympathizing with me, then said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I happened to see Frey Levi in this alley just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I saw him go in here too. And then I got lost&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same for me. It feels like I&rsquo;m being played by that guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed. Frey Levi seems to be accustomed to the royal capital itself, even.</p>

<p>Nero looked up at the sky, called Fugue and ordered her to search for Frey once again.</p>

<p>We went through this alley first. Nero remembered the way back.</p>

<p>We walked out to what seemed to be a bustling commoners&rsquo; fresh market.</p>

<p>It sold vegetables, grain, meat, and fresh seafood.</p>

<p>As I was gawking at the market, I saw a certain item and stopped in my tracks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rice&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s rice... , Nero, there&rsquo;s rice! Rice rice rice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I did expect that they would sell rice, since Miladriede was famous for its paella and risotto.</p>

<p>But, the truth was, I have never eaten rice since I was born in Maydare.</p>

<p>I regained my memories, and something that was bothering me was my craving for the food from my previous life. Even though I especially wanted to eat rice, there was not a lot of demand for it in this country other than in the capital, and it wasn&rsquo;t something you can get your hands on in the remote region of Deliafield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, what are you doing...I&rsquo;m going to leave you behind and go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa, hey hey hey, wait a minute, please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgetting my original goal for a moment, I made Nero wait as I hurriedly bought about 500 grams of rice. Most of it was imported from a large eastern country, and the price tag had &ldquo;From the Kingdom of Kirin*&rdquo; written on it. It was the biggest country in the east. I felt pleased with myself for getting rice, and then,</p>

<p> (TN: So this country is called &#40594;&#40607;&#22269; or Kirinkoku. I'm 90% sure this is supposed to be fantasy China but I'm unsure on how to translate it so I'll probably change it in the future. If any of you have read novels with a fantasy China, let me know about how they translate it.)</p>

<p> &ldquo;Aaaah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apricots! There&rsquo;s apricots! If there&rsquo;s rice, there has to be that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that it was the season where the pretty orange apricots were being harvested, and they were being sold like mountains. &ldquo;What are you using them for?&rdquo; Nero asked and made a strange face again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufufu. I&rsquo;m going to make umeboshi* with these. I can substitute citric acid with lemon juice, and I have special salt from the Salt Forest I can use...This can work!&rdquo;</p>

<p> (TN: Umeboshi is pickled dried plum.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about, but good for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero, of course, looked like he had no idea why I was so happy about rice and apricots, and the word umeboshi didn&rsquo;t seem to ring a bell for him.</p>

<p>My hands were full of rice and apricots, so Nero said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them,&rdquo; and took the apricots for me. Wow, he&rsquo;s surprisingly a thoughtful gentleman&#8230;</p>

<p>Just then, Fugue descended and told Nero something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oi, it seems that Frey Levi is on the roof of Diemo Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>

<p></p>

<p> The Diemo Cathedral was the largest Vabelist cathedral in the capital, and located in a square in the eastern section of the city.</p>

<p>At the top of the spires stood the golden statues of the ten creator gods, their eyes silently looking down on the city.</p>

<p>We met up with Lapis here. The large doors of the cathedral right at that moment, and people dressed in bishop&rsquo;s clothes came out in succession. Lapis joined the gathering crowd and stared at the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard a great bishop came here on a pilgrimage from the Vabel State*.&rdquo;</p>

<p> (TN: So Vabel is actually called &#12532;&#12449;&#12505;&#12523;&#25945;&#22269; in Japanese. It literally means &quot;Vabel Religion Country&quot;. According to the map in Vol 2 it's located in the Frezier Empire so it's basically like Vatican City. I'll just translate it as Vabel for now.)</p>

<p> &ldquo;Oh really&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bishop at the head, wearing a bishop&rsquo;s mitre*, glanced in our direction.</p>

<p> (TN: A mitre is a hat a bishop wears. Think of the pope's hat.)</p>

<p>For a moment, I felt like our eyes met through the veil that hung from his mitre&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, I think there&rsquo;s a staircase going up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yeah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis called out to us, and we went up to the roof from the stairs right next to the cathedral.</p>

<p>We had to pay a small fee to get up there, but&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uwaaaah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a good place to see the statues on the cathedral&rsquo;s spires, as well as the carvings on the pillars and arches, up close.</p>

<p>We could see Miladriede Castle and the distant mountains.</p>

<p>On the roof, there was a boy from Lune Ruschia lying on an installed bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're sorry to disturb you when you&rsquo;re sleeping so soundly, but could we have a minute?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nnnagh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just like Frey Levi to even wear an eye mask and take a nap.</p>

<p>When I called out to him, he took off his eye mask and yawned as he got up.</p>

<p>And then he took one look at us and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh....what&rsquo;s this? A confession!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a confession, or scouting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, sorry. I have a rule of only taking up the offers of older women. Anyways, you guys kept chasing me. It was annoying, so I kept shaking you off though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey Levi said, and then flopped down again. We looked at each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re recruiting team members. You still don&rsquo;t belong to one, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Nero&rsquo;s frank words, Frey Levi, still laying down, only directed his eyes towards him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh--. I thought I&rsquo;ve seen you somewhere. You&rsquo;re my silent roommate, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He finally noticed his roommate, Nero.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. The first year&rsquo;s team decision. But it&rsquo;s such a pain~.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This guy was idling about like a little kid&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not planning to advance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope, not at all. I won&rsquo;t have a good life even if I graduate. I&rsquo;m fine with being a freshman forever. Besides, I&rsquo;m not interested in younger women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey Levi looked at Lapis and me and let out a big sigh.</p>

<p>Seeing him like this actually convinced us that it would be okay to include him in our team.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fortunate. Also, did you notice the contradiction in the words you spoke? If you say you&rsquo;re fine with being a freshman forever, then that means that one day even the fourth-year seniors will be younger than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked like he realized that just now. So, this man was...an idiot?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be assigned to a team in a month anyway. You&rsquo;ll be put together with the leftovers. So what does it matter, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the benefit of me joining your team?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll always be aiming for number one. That&rsquo;s to say, you&rsquo;ll be able to get good grades!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I said that with a triumphant look on my face, Frey Levi looked plainly uninterested and turned over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not aimin&rsquo; for that. Being number one means standing out. I don&rsquo;t wanna stand out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so noisy. It&rsquo;s cuz there&rsquo;s people who would be bothered if I stood out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re standing out in a bad way even now, though,&rdquo; Nero muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, geez, you guys are so annoying. Go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As expected, it seemed that he was beginning to get annoyed, and we felt that there was no use saying anything more, and were about to leave. But I didn&rsquo;t want to give up on Frey Levi, so I turned around and asked him something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just out of curiosity, but what are the favorable terms for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, a woman who&rsquo;s without a doubt older than me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something difficult for a first-year team&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of older woman, for instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah...there&rsquo;s a senior I&rsquo;m going after, but I doubt lowly first-years like you would be useful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Senior Nagie Medite. She&rsquo;s the head of the girls&rsquo; dorm, so you know her, right? She seems like she&rsquo;s a flower on a high peak and not easy to deal with, but it&rsquo;s that kind of thing that tickles the curiosity of an older lady killer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ooooh,&rdquo; I said, and gave a big nod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big Sis Nagi certainly is a wonderful girl who&rsquo;s easygoing and reliable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you get it then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey Levi got up energetically. I secretly gloated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m Senior Nagie&rsquo;s cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Cousin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey Levi rudely muttered, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look like her at all.&rdquo; And I, being me, told him this bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Big Sis Nagi has any interest in frivolous men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Big Sis Nagi was a reliable senior who led the girls&rsquo; dormitory, but apparently recently, an older male royal magician had toyed with her heart...I heard her declare boldly that she would never be fooled by men again.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, a frivolous playboy like Frey Levi might be completely out of the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, there might be some hope for an obedient, serious, and gallant younger man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frey Levi made a complicated expression that was half interest, half caution.</p>

<p>He sat cross-legged and began to listen to me earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing there is to do now is to get results from the Potions field trip. Big Sis Nagi is the daughter of the Medite family. She would probably hate men who don&rsquo;t properly show up to the herb collecting field training.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kuh...you&rsquo;re trying to take me in with that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare opportunity, so why not get taken in? I&rsquo;ve got a special role for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Role?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Big Sis Nagi asked me to make her an elderflower herb cordial. I&rsquo;ll have you deliver it to her this time. If you say that you were asked to do it by me, who is in the same team as you, that would at least give you something to talk about, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps that was effective, because after a long sigh, Frey said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haa...okay, okay. Then, I&rsquo;ll join your team on that condition. In return, make sure to tell Senior Nagie about my heroic figure during the field trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;heroic figure during the field trip&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haaa? Let me tell you something. You&rsquo;ll regret it if you underestimate field training just because it&rsquo;s the first one. Lune Ruschia&rsquo;s teachers don&rsquo;t go easy on anyone. They've set up a lot of traps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not worried, because I&rsquo;ve been through it once last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was awfully proud for someone who had to repeat a year. But it was actually reassuring to have a team member who experienced the field training once. I knew we couldn&rsquo;t let this guy get away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I will do my best to fulfill your wishes. You should use us and show your cool side to Big Sis Nagi. ...No matter what the results are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an older lady killer. The results can be clearly seen. I just didn&rsquo;t have the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes yes. Well, even if you aren&rsquo;t interested in us, your teammates, remember our names at least. I&rsquo;m Makia O&rsquo;Drielle. This is Lapis Twilight. And over here is your roommate, Nero Pachelbel. We&rsquo;ll be applying as a four-person team at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the team leader?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon? Team leader?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rule for a team leader to be chosen when you apply. I don&rsquo;t want that bothersome role.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, Frey threw himself down again. Lapis, Nero and I looked at each other.</p>

<p>Lapis and Nero both shook their heads at the same time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...It can&rsquo;t be helped, huh. Okay, I&rsquo;ll be the team leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4></p>

<p>We went straight back to school and I went to Professor Medite as the team leader to apply for our team.</p>

<p>Professor Medite was marking quizzes in his atelier, but when he saw that I was there, he got all excited and started making me a cup of his special black tea. He also had no teacher&rsquo;s dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Miss Makia. I was thinking you&rsquo;d be coming here soon. What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you feeling homesick? Did you miss your uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the case at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told me to call him Professor, but he was completely acting like a family member.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I finally got my team together, so I came to make the application. The members are Lapis Twilight, Nero Pachelbel, Frey Levi, and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoo, you&rsquo;ve got some very unique members here. I especially didn&rsquo;t expect Frey Levi to join your team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Hey, is Frey really just a failed student? He&rsquo;s blessed by&#12304;Earth&#12305;, and it somewhat seems to me that he&rsquo;s pretending to get bad marks, but...do you know anything, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor stopped marking and glanced at me through the gap of his monocle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not look it, but I do take pride in my job as a teacher as such. I&rsquo;m not foolish enough to talk about the private affairs of a student. ...But you&rsquo;re right, Frey Levi is a rare talent. He only failed a grade last year because he didn&rsquo;t show up to classes midway through and didn&rsquo;t have enough credits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>...You told me just now, I thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he puts his mind to it, he is gifted enough to reach great heights as a magician. Nobody can pull that kid up, but perhaps you, Miss Makia, might be able to do something about that problem child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Do I have that kind of talent, I wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were the one who discovered young Thor and pulled him up into this world. You have the power to discover treasure-like things that no one else can find. ...As well as the courage to extend your hand to things that everyone else has abandoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect Thor&rsquo;s name to come up here.</p>

<p>I put down my teacup, and as I stared at the swaying tea,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Professor, how is Thor doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Mmm...yeah. It seems that they&rsquo;re also having a lot of problems over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Problems?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor responded with another meaningful &ldquo;Mmm&rdquo;, but then started talking as though he thought it was okay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Makia, do you know the reason why the existence of the Savior is still not made public yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, I have been wondering about that&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was right.</p>

<p>The truth was, from the night the stars fell until today, the existence of the Savior had not been generally revealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The legend was passed down under secrecy, so I wondered if there was a rule like that or something. But this is a magic school, and there are a lot of nobles, so I thought people who knew, knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Almost two years have passed since the night of the meteor shower, and that rumor is spreading no matter how hard they try to hide it. The most frightening thing is that the Savior legend is being distorted and spread to the masses. In fact, what we should have done was to make a formal announcement from the palace and explain about the Savior and the Guardians. There is a little problem though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Problem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...There&rsquo;s one person missing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Medite lined up the sugar cubes on his desk. &ldquo;This is the Savior,&rdquo; he indicated a pink sugar cube. He then lined up white sugar cubes around it and said, &ldquo;And these are the Guardians who protect the Savior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One, two, three...but that was it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To put it simply, there&rsquo;s still one Guardian who hasn&rsquo;t been found. Even though there should be four Guardians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Thor was taken away on the first day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that became my trauma as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In young Thor&rsquo;s case, there were many people around him who knew the Savior legend. In fact, the three who were gathered were summoned to the palace in less than a week. That was because they are all people of status. However, they couldn&rsquo;t find the last person no matter what. It was about a year after the night of the meteor shower that the Savior, the crux of it all, was found, but that was to be expected. &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is that expected? I&rsquo;m a bit curious. It wasn&rsquo;t until well after the night of falling stars that I heard that the Savior appeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is because, according to tradition, the Savior will arrive &lsquo;within a year&rsquo; from the night of falling stars, when the sound of good tidings resound throughout the world. Sometimes they appear right after the night of falling stars, and sometimes it takes a little while. To put it simply, that meteor shower and sound of good tidings are announcements to &lsquo;prepare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who or what are the announcements for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re for the people who live in this world. The Guardians who are chosen by the stars, of course, as well as the kings of each nation, and the great magicians...For what is to come, for everyone who will engrave their names into the turning points of history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as though the world was taking the initiative in creating the surging and undulation of the times.</p>

<p>However, I swallowed those words and silently continued to listen to Uncle&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time, the Savior was apparently found in a village on the outskirts, but luckily they were able to protect her immediately. It seems that there are cases when the Savior is not found right away even when they have descended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle said that it could happen that a person from another world who fell into this world as the Savior would get captured by bad people or get involved in an incident and never be found.</p>

<p>For those reasons, this legend was not widely known to the public. There was the fear of this legend being misused when the Savior arrived in this world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, for that reason, when the Mark of the Guardian appears on someone who doesn&rsquo;t know that legend, they might think it is just a strange bruise and not come forward. Or even if they do know, the person doesn&rsquo;t show up for some reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Medite put away the papers on his desk, rested his chin in his hands, blew on his pipe, and continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The palace must quickly assemble all four people and send the Savior to the &lsquo;Holy Land&rsquo; in the Vabel State. I heard that the Archbishop over there is angry because the Savior hasn&rsquo;t come to the Holy Land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. According to the legend, once the Savior and the four Guardians are assembled, they&rsquo;re supposed to head for the Holy Land first&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Vabel State was a small country that was the headquarters of Vabelism, Maydare&rsquo;s largest religion, and it protected the &ldquo;Holy Land.&rdquo; It was located in the capital city of Frezier, the large nation in the west.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I saw great bishops from Vabel at Diemo Cathedral today.</p>

<p>Could it be that they were visiting the Kingdom of Ruschia for this matter&#8230;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The palace will announce the existence of the Savior and Guardians soon, so they must find the last Guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is...just an example, but if someone has the Mark of the Guardian, can they refuse to become a Guardian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s already an international obligation, and the king will issue a royal command. If you defy it, you will be sentenced to prison. If you&rsquo;re unlucky, your family will be taken as hostages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recalled the day Thor was taken away.</p>

<p>Thor was forcibly taken away. What he thought about it, how he decided to accept his destiny and go to the royal capital...I didn&rsquo;t know any of that.</p>

<p>But, maybe it was for the sake of me, Father, and everyone else at the O&rsquo;Drielle house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place...why does the Savior come to this world? The legend says they will guide a chaotic Maydare to stability, but is it really that chaotic? It seems peaceful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Medite smiled wryly at my words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because this is the southern Kingdom of Ruschia, the furthest place from the conflict. On an international scale, it is not the case that there are no signs of a major war. They say that the Hermedes Heavenly Empire in the north is an aggressive nation, and they want the &lsquo;Holy Land.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So to sum it up...does that mean that there&rsquo;s a possibility that Hermedes in the north and Frezier, including the Holy Land, in the west might go to war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A war between two great nations vying for the dominance of Maydare.</p>

<p>It would be a chaotic world comparable to the Great War five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know how much power or what kind of role the Savior who descended from another world this time has, but there is no doubt that she will be entrusted with the fate of the world just like the &lsquo;Savior of Fraxinus&rsquo; five hundred years ago. For this reason, the remaining Guardian must be found quickly. This kind of talk might only make you worried about Thor, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>...That was true.</p>

<p>My heart beat wildly when I thought about how Thor might be involved in such a big war.</p>

<p>I was carefreely enjoying my life at magic school. Even though I was struggling so hard just to gather team members, over there, they were trying to gather comrades to protect the world.</p>

<p>I have a goal to meet Thor, but after I meet him and confirm my feelings, then...Was there anything I can do?</p>

<p>Or maybe Thor already loved the Savior, and was devoted to her&#8230;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Even after I left Professor Medite&rsquo;s atelier and returned to the girls&rsquo; dorm, I felt distressed.</p>

<p>I disinfected the apricots I just bought with a piece of gauze I soaked in alcohol-concentrated liquor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, geez. What are you getting so timid about, Makia O&rsquo;Drielle! Your only redeeming features are your baseless self-confidence, pointless self-important attitude and sharp tongue. Even though your past life is full of regrets because you were thinking too much about weird things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong all of a sudden, Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no...just talking to myself, Lapis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cleared my throat so that I wouldn&rsquo;t look suspicious to Lapis, who was helping me make umeboshi.</p>

<p>Ultimately, what the current me was able to do might only be getting good grades in school and producing results with my team members at the field training.</p>

<p>So tonight, I was going to bottle this fruit, add lemon juice for acidity, and use the salt from the Salt Forest to pickle some apricot umeboshi.</p>
