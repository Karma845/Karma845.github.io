<h2>Chapter 22: Promotion Exam</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>&quot;Ta-Tanaka-san!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like you to explain the situation, but... before that. Everyone!! Hurry up and provide medical assistance!! Save every life you can!!&quot;</p>

<p>With a voice loud enough to rival the helicopter's noise, Tanaka-san ordered the clearers. Many people were injured in the village ravaged by the orcs, and several buildings had collapsed.</p>

<p>Thanks to the swift response, the villagers were being rescued.</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, can you tell me about it later?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha...ha...yes...&quot;</p>

<p>I forced a dry smile.</p>

<p>There was no escaping now; perhaps my qualifications would be revoked, and I would become an unqualified clearer.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san and I participated in the rescue efforts.</p>

<p>The damage was not as severe as it seemed, with the village chief and the first five who entered the dungeon being dead or injured.</p>

<p>Other than that, several other lives were lost.</p>

<p>Although many lives were lost, the fact that the damage from a dungeon collapse of this scale was minimal was probably due to me quickly defeating all the orcs.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it wouldn't be surprising if an entire village disappeared from the map.</p>

<p>Several hours later.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Kai-kun, let's go home. We'll hand it over to the Dungeon Association. I want you to tell me everything in detail, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yes, understood...&quot;</p>

<p>Under the pressure of Tanaka-san's smile that wasn't really a smile, I boarded the helicopter. This helicopter was owned by Avalon for emergency use, and Tanaka-san had immediately arranged for it to fly to this village... or rather, to help me.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Amachi-san!!&quot;</p>

<p>As I was about to board the helicopter, Nagisa came running towards me, followed by her grandmother.</p>

<p>Today's events lasted only about four hours, but it felt like we spent a very intense time together.</p>

<p>She's like my little sister, frail and worrisome, but the Dungeon Association will probably protect her from now on.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm leaving. Take care, Nagisa. Don't do anything reckless anymore. Grandma, I leave the rest to you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Amachi-san, thank you so much for saving my granddaughter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-wait, please! I... I want to talk more with Amachi-san!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, I feel the same way. Nagisa, you remind me so much of my sister that I couldn't leave you alone. But from now on, the Dungeon Association will protect you. Don't worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-sister!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you really look like my sister. Your age, height, hairstyle, and even your name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-well, what about as a woman!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A woman? Haha, you're quite mischievous for a middle school student, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>I lightly flicked her forehead.</p>

<p>I don't have a taste for seeing a girl who's much younger than my sister as a romantic interest. Nagisa puffed out her cheeks while looking up at me and rubbing her forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll grow taller! W-will you see me again when I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm looking forward to it. You seem like you'll become a great friend for my sister, Nagi. Let's meet again someday!&quot;</p>

<p>I waved and boarded the helicopter as it was.</p>

<p>Nagisa waved back at me with a voice loud enough to drown out the helicopter noise, saying she would definitely come to see me.</p>

<p>Tanaka-san laughed with a grin, saying, &quot;Well done,&quot; but it's true that I've become stronger. He must be praising me.</p>

<p>And so, we flew through the sky towards Tokyo.</p>

<p>The time had already passed midnight, and with the end of the dungeon collapse in Yonaki Village that day, the Dungeon Association would now manage it as a D-Rank dungeon.</p>

<p>All responsibility was pinned on the deceased village chief, and everyone else was acquitted.</p>

<p>I thought that was a bit questionable, but since the village chief was mainly to blame, there was no other choice.</p>

<p>The midnight sky was pitch black, and nothing could be seen. I wondered if this is what darkness feels like. I felt a little scared.</p>

<p>While looking out the window and thinking that...</p>

<p>&quot;Let's talk about the various circumstances tomorrow, just the two of us. We'll take our time without anyone bothering us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yes...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm looking forward to it... Kai-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yeah me too~~&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san smiled.</p>

<p>However, his eyes weren't smiling.</p>

<p>I decided to tell Tanaka-san everything and give up on hiding it.</p>

<p>That day, we arrived in Tokyo and disbanded.</p>

<p>It was late at night, so the trains weren't running, but Tanaka-san arranged a taxi for me, saying it was a company expense.</p>

<p>I wondered what kind of expense it was but took advantage of it and headed straight home.</p>

<p>That was because my fatigue had reached its peak.</p>

<p>I had been masking it with adrenaline, but it seemed like I had been pushing myself too hard. As soon as I got home, I slept until the afternoon the next day.</p>

<p>&#9671; The next day, noon</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa!? I overslept... it's already 12 o'clock...&quot;</p>

<p>I sprang up from bed, looked at the clock, and stretched, thinking it had been a long time since I slept this much. I had slept like a log, probably due to exhaustion, but it seemed like a lot of the fatigue had been lifted.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a dinner appointment with Tanaka-san tonight... What should I do? I have some free time, maybe I should go clear a dungeon?&quot;</p>

<p>I checked my own status.</p>


<p>Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: None</p>

<p>Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p>Magic Power: 385</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=96</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=96</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=96</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=96</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>

<p>&#12539;High Wolf&rsquo;s fang sword = Attack Power +120</p>


<p>&quot;Finally at 385... My magic power increased by 100 in the Orc dungeon. I guess I'm at the lower end of C-Rank according to the Dungeon Association's standards.&quot;</p>

<p>In the Dungeon Association, it's possible to measure magic power.</p>

<p>I don't know the details of how it works, but it takes about thirty minutes to measure, and it can be done for free.</p>

<p>They use the vibrations generated when magic power flows through a magic stone to measure the magic power of the person being tested.</p>

<p>That being said, the frequency of the vibrations is used as the basis for what's called magic power.</p>

<p>And I suppose the magic power value I can see in this status is the same as that value.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, they said it's integrated with human common sense, but I wonder if it's showing me things in a way that's easy for me to understand?&quot;</p>

<p>First of all, the criteria for ranks like E-Rank and D-Rank were created by humans.</p>

<p>The ability to see this status is definitely not due to human power.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, having it displayed in a way that's easy for me to understand is very helpful.</p>

<p>&quot;C-Rank is up to 1,000 magic power, so it's still far away... But I'll do my best.&quot;</p>

<p>E-Rank is for magic power between 10 and 50. D-Rank is for up to 100, and C-Rank is for up to 1,000.</p>

<p>From there, it increases by one digit at a time, so B-Rank is up to 10,000, and anything beyond that is A-class.</p>

<p>Anything higher than that is called S-Rank, and at that point, I don't really understand it anymore.</p>

<p>There's actually an even higher class that exists, but the inflation is so extreme it's surprising.</p>

<p>With the above calculation method, the magic power difference between the upper and lower ranks of C-Rank is a whopping ten times.</p>

<p>I think there should be more divisions, but since each class is further divided into lower, middle, and upper ranks, it might be fine as it is.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, speaking of which!&quot;</p>

<p>I took out the bronze-colored Class Upgrade Ticket I had collected yesterday from my pocket. I was too sleepy yesterday and fell asleep without doing anything, but now I have ten of them.</p>

<p>I picked up the remaining nine tickets that were stored in a drawer.</p>

<p>I now have ten of them, but I'm not sure what I should do with them.</p>

<p>As I was thinking that, the ten tickets suddenly started to shine brightly.</p>

<p>&#12302;Initiating class upgrade... Emblem of the Knight confirmed. The Knight Promotion Exam will begin.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;W-what!?&quot;</p>

<p>The tickets merged into one, and its appearance changed slightly.</p>

<p>The size remained the same, about the size of a bill, and the cover displayed something like a countdown.</p>

<p>I looked at the status of the ticket.</p>


<p>Type: Item</p>

<p>Title: Class Upgrade Ticket (10/10)</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: C</p>

<p>Effect&#65306;-</p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>Commencing Knight Promotion Exam</p>

<p>Time remaining until transfer: 00:00:58</p>


<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the displayed status.</p>

<p>It showed &quot;Time remaining until transfer: 00:00:58.&quot;</p>

<p>The number 58 decreased by one every second, and now it's at 54.</p>

<p>In other words...</p>

<p>&quot;No way! It starts just by collecting ten of them!? No one told me that!&quot;</p>

<p>I hurriedly started to prepare my equipment.</p>

<p>Sure, for those who can't see the status, it makes sense that the exam would start automatically once they've collected the tickets, but still!</p>

<p>Since I had only one minute left, I hastily stuffed my usual dungeon-exploring tools into my bag.</p>

<p>I washed my face, rinsed my mouth, put on my shoes, and grabbed my sword.</p>

<p>I added some store-bought bread I had on hand, and somehow, I was ready.</p>

<p>Why did I have to get ready in just 30 seconds in real life?[1]</p>

<p>Then, the emotionless voice informed me.</p>

<p>&#12302;Beginning the promotion exam.&#12303;</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>When I opened my eyes, I saw a familiar scenery.</p>

<p>&quot;This looks just like the place when I got the golden Cube...&quot;</p>

<p>A cube-shaped room about 50 meters across.</p>

<p>The walls were made of artificial stone panels.</p>

<p>And there was a door in front of me.</p>

<p>It wasn't too big and had no decorations.</p>

<p>It was about 2 or 3 meters tall, quite modest compared to doors such as the boss rooms.</p>

<p>&quot;A promotion exam... If I take it literally, does it mean my job will be promoted? They said it was a knight promotion exam since I have the Emblem of the Knight... But what is a knight in the first place? I'm jobless, aren't I?&quot;</p>

<p>I changed my clothes and prepared since I had no other way to return. I packed my bag and reached to open the door in front of me.</p>

<p>&#12302;Confirming knight's emblem... Individual name: Amachi Kai. No occupation... Initiating novice knight exam.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Novice knight... If I clear it, will I go from jobless to a knight?&quot;</p>

<p>The usual announcement suddenly echoed in my brain.</p>

<p>It seemed that I would indeed be granted a job if I cleared this dungeon.</p>

<p>I absolutely wanted to clear it, or rather, I couldn't go home anyway.</p>

<p>Would some special exam start because I had the Emblem of the Knight?</p>

<p>Having lost my way out, I tightly gripped the golden tag attached to my chest and opened the door.</p>

<p>There was a similar square room with four massive pillars, and one...</p>

<p>&quot;Armor?&quot;</p>

<p>It was about the size of an adult man, wore a full plate of recognizably medieval armor, and held a silver shield.</p>

<p>It walked from one end of the room to the other and back in a regular pattern.</p>

<p>Was it a monster? It didn't seem to have any will of its own.</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't seem to have noticed me yet... Do I have to defeat that? How strong is it, I wonder...&quot;</p>


<p>Name: Shield User</p>

<p>Magic Power: 200</p>

<p>Skill: Provocation</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;50%=100</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Equipment</p>

<p>&#12539;Iron Shield=Defense+50</p>


<p>&quot;It's pretty strong. A shield user... But I'm still stronger, and it can't attack, can it? Provocation... This is a skill that gathers the agro of monsters, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Provocation, a skill used by high-level clearers, can gather agro from monsters.</p>

<p>The fact that it had this skill meant that it was literally a vanguard job.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>Thinking it wouldn't help to worry, I moved stealthily from the shield user's line of sight to behind a pillar.</p>

<p>I should be out of sight behind the pillar, and as the full plate armor turned to walk to the other side, I struck from behind.</p>

<p>In an instant, it turned to face me, raising its shield to resist.</p>

<p>Our weapons clashed, creating a dull sound as metal met metal.</p>

<p>However, my weight and posture were advantageous.</p>

<p>If my status was also advantageous, I could overpower it with sheer force.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhhh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Without any particular technique, I used brute force, with an attack power of 96 + 120.</p>

<p>The nearly doubled difference in values was strikingly apparent as I pushed aside and sent the shield flying.</p>

<p>The iron shield danced in the air, and I thrust my sword into the now-defenseless full plate armor.</p>

<p>My sword penetrated the iron armor, producing the unique sound of metal scraping against metal, and pierced the shield user's chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... Did I use too much brute force... Oh, the next door opened.&quot;</p>

<p>The defeated shield user vanished like smoke, and the door behind it opened with a rumbling sound.</p>

<p>I guess this room is cleared, but it was surprisingly easy even though it had the highest stats of any enemy I've faced so far.</p>

<p>I peeked into the next room through the door.</p>

<p>It was an entirely identical room with four pillars arranged regularly.</p>

<p>In front of the next door, I could see something wearing a robe about 50 meters ahead.</p>

<p>A mage? What stood there was something wearing a full-body robe but seemingly empty inside.</p>

<p>I squint and check its status.</p>

<p>My eyes can display the status if I can see it, even from a distance.</p>

<p>However, it doesn't work for TVs or video, so I have to see it directly with my eyes.</p>

<p>Moreover, I can read it even from a distance where I shouldn't be able to read the characters.</p>

<p>Rather than being able to read it, it might be more accurate to say that I can understand it, but I somehow just know.</p>


<p>Name: Mage</p>

<p>Magic Power: 200</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;50%=100</p>

<p>Equipment</p>

<p>&#12539;Witch&rsquo;s Robe=Intelligence+50</p>


<p>&quot;A mage, huh... They must have an extreme focus on intelligence. I wonder if they're incredibly smart.&quot;</p>

<p>If my earlier analysis is correct, they should have several times my intelligence.</p>

<p>I cautiously enter the room, thinking they might be plotting something extraordinary.</p>

<p>The moment I enter:</p>

<p>&quot;!? Is this a fireball!? That's not the size of a ball!&quot;</p>

<p>The mage creates a huge ball of fire in midair.</p>

<p>They throw it at me, and I immediately run to a nearby pillar to dodge.</p>

<p>The fireball, larger than myself, slams into the wall, charring the stone.</p>

<p>The temperature in the room rises in an instant, and I feel like I could get burned just from the hot air.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed, a mage... Could it be that intelligence is the power of magic?&quot;</p>

<p>Watching the mage raise another fireball, I think to myself.</p>

<p>Despite having an intelligence of 150, their magic seems rather one-dimensional and I don't sense any particular intelligence in it.</p>

<p>I can't rule out the possibility of a strategy, but they're simply launching fireballs at me repeatedly.</p>

<p>All of them just scorch the pillar I'm hiding behind.</p>

<p>&quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5.&quot;</p>

<p>I count the seconds while hiding behind the wall.</p>

<p>I notice that the mage&rsquo;s fireballs come at me roughly every five seconds.</p>

<p>So, in between that interval...</p>

<p>&quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Now's the time!&quot;</p>

<p>At that timing, I move to another pillar further in and hide again.</p>

<p>It was easy to deal with, as the mage was simply launching magic at regular intervals making me recall the game &quot;Red Light/Green Light&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright... I can get closer and defeat them next time!&quot;</p>

<p>At that timing, I jump right in front of the mage.</p>

<p>With my current power as a lower C-Rank, I can cover this distance in just a few seconds.</p>

<p>I raise my sword.</p>

<p>The mage tries to create a fireball in surprise, but there's no way they can make it in time. They fall, unable to resist, as I slash through their robe.</p>

<p>Just like before, the mage&rsquo;s robe turns into smoke and disappears as if its contents are gone.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew, alright. The door's open. If the enemies are at this level, I might be able to clear it pretty easily...&quot;</p>

<p>I poke my head through the door and check the situation inside.</p>

<p>&quot;...Pitch black?&quot;</p>

<p>But the room is pitch black.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no light source, and it's as quiet and dark as a rural night.</p>

<p>&quot;...I can't see.&quot;</p>

<p>I cautiously entered the room.</p>

<p>I thought maybe the light would turn on when I entered, but that wasn't the case.</p>

<p>The door slams shut behind me, cutting off my escape route.</p>

<p>&quot;...I can't see the enemy... But the door is closed... What should I&#9472;!?&quot;</p>

<p>As I pondered what to do, I felt something move in the corner of my vision.</p>

<p>Yet, there was no sound.</p>

<p>The room itself was as quiet and dim as the night.</p>

<p>I draw my sword and stay on guard.</p>

<p>Straining my ears, focusing, relying only on my hearing, I stay alert.</p>

<p>I can sense that something is after my life.</p>

<p>I desperately try to see something with my eyes.</p>

<p>Then, in the corner of my vision, I spot something and swing my sword at it.</p>

<p>The resulting clash is between my sword and a dagger, but there is no sound.</p>

<p>&quot;What!?&quot;</p>

<p>It was a strange discomfort, where there should have been sound, but there was none.</p>

<p>Yet, there were intense sword clashes scattering sparks.</p>

<p>Finally visible when it came right in front of me was a small figure cloaked in a black robe, swinging a dagger.</p>

<p>The relentless onslaught pressed on, trying to claim my life.</p>

<p>I managed to fend off the flurry of dagger strikes with my familiar longsword, but the discomfort prevented my body from moving as I intended.</p>

<p>Moreover, my visibility was poor.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it... take this!&quot;</p>

<p>I swung my sword forcefully, sending the small figure flying.</p>

<p>I took a moment to regain some distance and squinted my eyes, then the status appeared.</p>


<p>Name: Assassin</p>

<p>Magic Power: 200</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;50%=100</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=50</p>

<p>Equipment</p>

<p>&#12539;Assassin&rsquo;s Short Sword: Agility+50</p>


<p>&quot;An assassin... silent... let me check the details...&quot;</p>

<p>I examine the skill details.</p>


<p>Type: Skill</p>

<p>Title: Silent</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: B</p>

<p>Effect&#65306;While active, all surrounding emitted sounds are silenced.</p>


<p>&quot;So this is the source of the discomfort... complete darkness and silence. What a terrible combination.&quot;</p>

<p>It was an assassin.</p>

<p>Their attacks were strong, swift, and approached without making a sound.</p>

<p>The unmistakable assassin ran around in the darkness, aiming for my life.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... I see... but I'm glad.&quot;</p>

<p>I grip my sword with both hands and hold it in the centerline.</p>

<p>I calm my heart and concentrate.</p>

<p>My life is in danger, but it's strange that I feel so calm.</p>

<p>Maybe after that day, when I was prepared to throw everything away and literally risked my life, I gained resistance to the primal fear of death.</p>

<p>If it was the old me, I would have been trembling and holding my head in fear.</p>

<p>But now, I can fight.</p>

<p>It wasn't about my status but my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Haah!&quot;</p>

<p>With synchronized breath, I strike a powerful downward blow.</p>

<p>The white sword cuts through the darkness, and at its tip, the small black figure breathes their last.</p>

<p>&quot;...The compatibility was bad for you. Your status is fully visible even in the darkness.&quot;</p>

<p>Even in this darkness, my divine eyes display the status.</p>

<p>Then I quickly knew they were there.</p>

<p>The little person disappears in a puff of smoke, and the room lights up, confirming my victory.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... I'm glad. If I didn't have these eyes, it could have been really dangerous... I'll take a short break before moving on.&quot;</p>

<p>I look at the next door.</p>

<p>I'm getting a bit tired, so I take out some bread and water from the bag I brought and have a meal.</p>

<p>I wasn't very hungry since I just woke up, but my stomach seems to have awakened after the intense battle.</p>

<p>I gulp down the bread and water and take a 30-minute break.</p>

<p>I switch gears and get back into battle mode.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>I've been in this dungeon for almost an hour, including the break.</p>

<p>I wonder how long it will go on as I peek into the next room.</p>

<p>The structure of the room hasn't changed.</p>

<p>The room is well lit and easy to see.</p>

<p>However, it was clearly different from what I had encountered so far.</p>

<p>That's because...</p>

<p>&quot;Are you serious...&quot;</p>

<p>A shield user, a mage, and an assassin were waiting for me, all three of them.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>&quot;Tough!&quot;</p>

<p>That was my first exclamation.</p>

<p>A shield user, a mage, and an assassin.</p>

<p>Each of them would be easy to defeat on their own for me now.</p>

<p>In fact, I had defeated them before.</p>

<p>However, when all three of them were together, it felt like I was fighting against an adventurer party.</p>

<p>&quot;What should I do...?&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately, they didn't seem to attack until I entered the room, so I decided to devise a strategy.</p>

<p>It seemed like I couldn't return from this alternate space without conquering it, so I couldn't run away either.</p>

<p>&quot;The most troublesome one is the assassin. Their combat power should be the highest. But it's not dark, so it might be easier? Still, leaving the mage's fireball unchecked is tough, and if I instantly kill the shield user first... hmm.&quot;</p>

<p>I sat cross-legged, pondering what I should do.</p>

<p>After thinking for a while, I came up with a plan.</p>

<p>&quot;The mage takes about 5 seconds to cast a spell. If I run at full speed now, I should be able to cover 50 meters within 5 seconds... Let's defeat the mage first.&quot;</p>

<p>That was my strategy.</p>

<p>The remaining two were the shield user and the assassin.</p>

<p>I had instantly killed the shield user earlier, and the assassin shouldn't be much of a threat to me with my eyes.</p>

<p>It would be a tough fight, but if I fought carefully against the assassin, I should be able to win even in a two-on-one situation.</p>

<p> &quot;Alright!&quot;</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and crouched down, as if I were in a starting position in front of the opened door.</p>

<p>I could hear the sound of my heartbeat, pounding.</p>

<p>But perhaps it was the thrill, there was a part of me that was enjoying it.</p>

<p>Until now, I was too weak to be allowed to fight.</p>

<p>But now that I've gained this power, I can feel myself getting stronger, little by little.</p>

<p>I find the battle against strong enemies enjoyable, and the feeling of growth is enjoyable as well.</p>

<p>It's strange.</p>

<p>There is fear.</p>

<p>But there's also enjoyment.</p>

<p>Unclear emotions coexist.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm a battle junkie.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it the backlash from being weak?&quot;</p>

<p>I chuckled a bit.</p>

<p>The idea of being able to grow through effort.</p>

<p>That the world would change.</p>

<p>How enjoyable it is.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew...!&quot;</p>

<p>I exhaled and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>Timing my dash, I sprinted with all my might.</p>

<p>Slipping past the shield user, ignoring the assassin, feeling the wall of wind as the distance between me and the mage rapidly closed.</p>

<p>The mage hurriedly raises both hands, but I'm faster than the fireball coming together.</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<p>I swing my raised sword down.</p>

<p>All I have to do now is swing it down, and I should be able to defeat the mage.</p>

<p>With this, I've conquered the challenge.</p>

<p>I did it!</p>

<p>However, when you think you've succeeded, that's usually when you fail.</p>

<p>&quot;UOOOO!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;!?&quot;</p>

<p>A loud voice comes from behind.</p>

<p>The source of the voice is the shield user, and I find myself looking back at them.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Even if they raised their voice, I should have continued swinging my sword down.</p>

<p>But somehow, I was forced to shift my focus and ended up facing the shield user with my sword.</p>

<p>&quot;Provocation!? It works on humans too!!&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly regain my composure and understand.</p>

<p>This is the shield user's skill, Provocation.</p>

<p>The consequence of instantly killing them earlier has caught up to me. If I had faced the shield user in the first room and received the provocation, I would have noticed.</p>

<p>But I assumed that provocation would only work on monsters.</p>

<p>That it shouldn't have any effect on intelligent humans.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it!!&quot;</p>

<p>I forcibly shift my thoughts and turn my gaze back to the mage.</p>

<p>I can still make it; I can still do this.</p>

<p>I raise my sword again, but...</p>

<p>&quot;Gaah!?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm blocked by the assassin who silently approached from the side.</p>

<p>With a flying kick, they hit my side with full force.</p>

<p>As I roll across the ground with momentum, I quickly get up and ready my sword.</p>

<p>However, a red fireball approaches right in front of me.</p>

<p>With my eyes wide open, I luckily spot a pillar in my field of vision and roll behind it.</p>

<p>But I'm not fast enough, and my leg gets burned by the magic.</p>

<p>&quot;Argh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Even so, it was just a moment, so only my shoe melted, and I suffered a burn.</p>

<p>It's a minor injury, my foot is stinging, and a blister is forming.</p>

<p>It's a minor injury that makes me want to cry when I walk, it really hurts...</p>

<p>&quot;Haah haah, that was close. Let's go outside for now... but... yeah, the door is closed.&quot;</p>

<p>I look at the door to go outside, but as expected, it is closed.</p>

<p>It seems that the only way for me to survive is to defeat these guys here.</p>

<p>&quot;I said the thrill was enjoyable, but I didn't expect it to be this intense...&quot;</p>

<p>I notice the status on the edge of my vision as I feel the heat on my back.</p>

<p>In other words, this is...</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you give me a break!?&quot;</p>

<p>I clash with their dagger and guard.</p>

<p>First, let's defeat the assassin.</p>

<p>I raise my sword.</p>

<p>&quot;UOOO!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it!!&quot;</p>

<p>But my focus is taken away.</p>

<p>The assassin vanishes again during the distraction.</p>

<p>I didn't think that the skill called Provocation, which only attracts attention for a moment, would be this troublesome.</p>

<p>Because of the distraction, I momentarily lose sight of the assassin, and they disappear silently into my blind spot.</p>

<p>&quot;So this is a party. It's strong... In reality, there's also a healer and a tank. Of course, an advanced party would be strong.&quot;</p>

<p>I was experiencing the strength of a party firsthand.</p>

<p>Although each opponent could be easily defeated individually, when they come together, they become this powerful.</p>

<p>This is what high-level clearers, like the elite force of Avalon, must be like: each one of them refined, and even more so as a team.</p>

<p>That's what gives people the power to stand up against mighty monsters, the strength of professional clearer teams.</p>

<p>I bet Tanaka-san's team is tens of times stronger than this.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't have time to think about that!!&quot;</p>

<p>The shield user, with their shield in front, slowly approaches me while drawing the sword from their waist.</p>

<p>Because of their high defense power, they can't be defeated in an instant from the front.</p>

<p>Besides, I have to be cautious about the assassin and avoid the magic.</p>

<p>I dodge the sword swung down by the shield user.</p>

<p>I also dodge the magic and the assassin's attacks.</p>

<p>My breath is sustained by the magical enhancement of my body, but the limit is approaching.</p>

<p>&quot;Haah haah... damn it!&quot;</p>

<p>How long have I been fighting? I've been on the defensive for several minutes.</p>

<p>However, it feels much longer than that.</p>

<p>Cuts from failed evasions are all over my body.</p>

<p>Blood drips, and my burnt foot is overused and turning purple.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I going to lose?... Here?&quot;</p>

<p>Shield user, assassin, mage.</p>

<p>Despite my injuries increasing, I still haven't been able to land a single solid attack on them.</p>

<p>If I can't land an effective hit, then at this rate...</p>

<p>Death.</p>

<p>That single word crosses my mind.</p>

<p>I am prepared for it, and I thought I had overcome it.</p>

<p>But I still don't want to die.</p>

<p>Up until now, the feeling of not wanting to die had created fear.</p>

<p>So, what about now that I've changed?</p>

<p>&quot;...That's right, I can't overcome anything if I don't risk my life... Alright!!&quot;</p>

<p>With a scream, I make a desperate resolution.</p>

<p>This is my last chance; if I fail, I might die.</p>

<p>But still, I'll grasp that one chance in a thousand.</p>

<p>I can't achieve my dreams or anything else if I don't risk my life.</p>

<p>Miracles only descend upon those who never give up.</p>

<p>I hold my sword and face forward.</p>

<p>A golden sparkle like a flame, lights up in the depths of my eyes.</p>

<p>Five seconds until the next magic.</p>

<p>The shield user is preparing to provoke; I look to the left.</p>

<p>There, on the status screen, the assassin aims their attack at me.</p>

<p>A single strike with a dagger, I've been sliced many times.</p>

<p>Even if I try to counterattack after dodging, they will escape due to provocation.</p>

<p>In that case, I...</p>

<p>&quot;Gwaaaah!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I stretch out my left arm.</p>

<p>I block the assassin's dagger with my left arm.</p>

<p>The dagger pierces through my arm, tearing it deeply.</p>

<p>The pain is so intense that it feels like I could scream, spreading throughout my body from my left arm.</p>

<p>I grit my teeth and keep my eyes wide open.</p>

<p>I fall on top of the assassin with the dagger still in my arm, pinning them down.</p>

<p>Then, with one hand, I grab my sword and raise it to impale them.</p>

<p>As usual, my focus is taken away by provocation.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh!!&quot;</p>

<p>Still, I keep the assassin in place with my left arm and my whole body weight.</p>

<p>The pain of the dagger tearing through my flesh almost makes me lose consciousness.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the pain quickly refocuses my attention on the assassin from the provocation.</p>

<p>&quot;Aaaah!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I swing my sword down and impale the assassin.</p>

<p>At the same time, without a moment's delay, I charge at the shield user.</p>

<p>That's because the mage&rsquo;s fire magic is floating behind them, but they can't shoot it because the shield user is in a straight line in front of it.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're going to provoke me that much!!&quot;</p>

<p>The shield user hastily draws their sword, and with blood seeping from my wounds, I grip my sword with both hands and swing it with all my might.</p>

<p>&quot;Aaaaaahhhhh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I shout from the bottom of my stomach.</p>

<p>With the intention of giving it my all here, I push forward with reckless abandon.</p>

<p>Before I know it, my sword reaches the shield user's neck, and I push through, severing their head from their torso.</p>

<p>The knight falls, seemingly about to collapse powerlessly backward.</p>

<p>But I don't let them fall, as they'll turn into smoke soon.</p>

<p>So, I hug the armor even tighter with both hands and throw it.</p>

<p>&quot;Nurraaaah!!!&quot;</p>

<p>To hit the fireball flying in front of me.</p>

<p>I throw the armor at the fireball, and the fireball explodes and disperses.</p>

<p>Due to the explosion happening at close range, an intense heat assaults me, causing mild burns all over my body.</p>

<p>My eyes flicker, and I feel like I'm about to fall to my knees.</p>

<p>Still, I don't collapse and let out a heartfelt shout.</p>

<p>As if to encourage myself, I can't give up here; I muster up my strength with my mind to motivate my body that's about to give up.</p>

<p>And then I run towards the magician.</p>

<p>&quot;You keep shooting from far away, over and over again!!&quot;</p>

<p>As if to clear my past resentment, I strike the magician with a full-power downward swing.</p>

<p>There's no form or technique, just a reckless blow relying on brute force, but it's faster than any strike I've thrown so far.</p>

<p>Unable to resist due to the magic cooldown, the magician is slashed apart.</p>

<p>Only a tattered robe remains behind.</p>

<p>&quot;Haah...&quot;</p>

<p>I collapse on my back, sprawled out.</p>

<p>With my eyes closed, I catch my breath, breathing heavily with my shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;I won... It's always a close call. For me... Haah...&quot;</p>

<p>Lying on the ground with my arms spread out, I breathe with my shoulders.</p>

<p>The cool stone floor cools my heated body.</p>

<p>I raise my right hand towards the sky and clench it.</p>

<p>I'm about to lose consciousness, but I grin and make a small victory pose with my right hand.</p>

<p>&quot;I really am... Haha, I'm going to die someday.&quot;</p>

<p>Contrary to my wish for this to be the end.</p>

<p>&#12302;The final test will begin&#12303;</p>

<p>Mercilessly, the trial stands in my way, as if to say, &quot;Show me you can overcome this much.&quot;</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>&#12302;The final trial... Selecting knight...&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, that's right. This is just the beginning. When it comes to God&rsquo;s trial.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember the Golden Cube.</p>

<p>The cruel god that always brings despair just when I think I've finally made it through.</p>

<p>As if testing my heart, the final trial is brandished before me, who wants to just sleep.</p>

<p>&#12302;...Confirmed. The highest aptitude is light... Adjusting status...&#12303;</p>

<p>I understand the meaning of the voice, and knowing I can't escape the battle, I stand up.</p>

<p>I wrap my left hand in a towel from my bag to stop the bleeding and make sure I can grip the sword.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do it... I'll give it my all here... And then!&quot;</p>

<p>I face forward and raise my sword again.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll have Tanaka-san treat me to some good food.&quot;</p>

<p>I force my trembling body to get up with sheer willpower.</p>

<p>In my line of sight, a knight slowly emerges from the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Lancelot? No, it's different...&quot;</p>

<p>It was a white knight.</p>

<p>Different from the memory of Lancelot, the white knight was more delicate.</p>

<p>Still, the shining white knight, faintly glowing in gold, looks at me.</p>

<p>I looked at the white knight.</p>


<p>Name: Nameless Knight</p>

<p>Status: Weakened</p>

<p>Job: Novice Knight (Light) &#12304;Beginner&#12305;</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;50%=100</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>


<p>&quot;It's not a monster? And... a knight...&quot;</p>

<p>I realize that the status display screen looks just like that of a human.</p>

<p>It should have been more simplistic for monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;The status is also weakened... I don't know anything anymore, but even so...&quot;</p>

<p>I stare at the knight.</p>

<p>The knight also draws the sword from its waist and stares at me through its armor.</p>

<p>Our gazes meet, and our fighting spirits mix.</p>

<p>&quot;I have to win.&quot;</p>

<p>I kept my eyes on the white knight without letting my guard down.</p>

<p>My fighting spirit is high, and my body seems to be able to move somehow with adrenaline.</p>

<p>There shouldn't be any problems.</p>

<p>I'm not being careless.</p>

<p>And yet.</p>

<p>&quot;!?&quot;</p>

<p>I lost sight of the knight.</p>

<p>I frantically look around, but the white knight is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>&quot;Where&#9472;!?&quot;</p>

<p>I hear the sound of armor creaking.</p>

<p>I hear the sound of air being crushed.</p>

<p>A sound I shouldn't be able to hear reaches my ears, and my instinct screams to run away from there.</p>

<p>I feel the sensation of blood draining from my entire body and, following my instincts, I quickly crouch down.</p>

<p>My hair floats in the air due to the law of inertia, and the remaining strands are cut horizontally.</p>

<p>Something passes by at high speed just a few centimeters above my head.</p>

<p>It was a sword.</p>

<p>I look up, and for a moment, I see the white knight flickering in and out of view as if reflecting randomly.</p>

<p>Noticing me, the knight looks at me.</p>

<p>It returns to its original white knight state and appears in my line of sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Invisibility... A skill?&quot;</p>

<p>I retreat at full speed, creating distance.</p>

<p>I check the status again and try to understand what happened.</p>

<p>Then, I focus on the skill &#12302;Mirage&#12303;, which is probably the cause.</p>

<p>&quot;Mirage... Is this a cheat?&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't help but let out a dry smile at the ridiculous ability of the skill called Mirage as I looked at the details.</p>


<p>Type: Skill</p>

<p>Title: True&#12539;Mirage</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: 1</p>

<p>Effect: Wraps an invisible armor around the user that is effective against opponents with lower intelligence.</p>


<p>It seems that this skill allows one to become invisible to opponents with lower intelligence than oneself. My intelligence is 96, while the knight's is 100.</p>

<p>There is only a difference of 4, but I'm undoubtedly losing, and the effect seems to be activated.</p>

<p>&quot;Invisible armor and invisible sword... That's unfair.&quot;</p>

<p>As I try to complain, the white knight refracts light while randomly reflecting, disappearing from my sight. It vanishes as if it's melting away, like when a glass container is placed in water.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it!!&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks to the power of the Eye of God, I can barely see the status. I somehow manage to grasp its position and, relying on intuition, I swing my sword.</p>

<p>There is the sound of metal being crushed, but the colliding sword is invisible. By now, I'm almost entirely fighting on luck.</p>

<p>If this knight uses a feint, there would be nothing I could do.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it! Ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>There's absolutely no way to break through.</p>

<p>The luck that had been on my side gradually abandons me, and cuts form all over my body.</p>

<p>Without the Eye of God, I would have been sliced to death from behind in an instant.</p>

<p>In terms of status, my attack power is slightly stronger due to the difference in weapons.</p>

<p>Although I'm losing by 4 points in intelligence, I'm winning in all other statuses.</p>

<p>Yet, I can't compete and continue to be pushed back.</p>

<p>The invisible flashes of light unleashed by the white knight swing like the scythe of the Grim Reaper, whittling away at my life.</p>

<p>&quot;Gah!!&quot;</p>

<p>My left arm, which had been wrapped in a towel, is cut through the towel, reminding me of the pain in my wounded left arm. I feel my disadvantage growing, and anxiety wells up in my heart. The adrenaline wears off, and my vision begins to lose light.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha... ha...&quot;</p>

<p>After several minutes of fighting, I'm left battered and bruised.</p>

<p>My left arm is discolored purple from the blood, and my left leg is swollen and red from burns.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't win...&quot;</p>

<p>My heart involuntarily utters words of weakness.</p>

<p>Although I had decided not to give up that day, my heart weakens easily due to fatigue, pain, and the lack of a way to break through.</p>

<p>Realizing this, I grimace at how easily my resolve crumbled.</p>

<p>But even so, the white knight does not wait for me.</p>

<p>Our swords clash, and I can no longer think.</p>

<p>The only reason I can still endure is that my body remembers how to fight, and something deep within my heart supports me.</p>

<p>(Haa Haa... I've been through something like this before...)</p>

<p>I recall the battle in the Golden Cube.</p>

<p>When I defeated the hobgoblin for the first time, I was also uttering words of weakness.</p>

<p>But I stood up once more. In the end, it wasn't my own will that supported me, but Nagi.</p>

<p>It's the same now.</p>

<p>I'm weak, and my determination wavers easily.</p>

<p>People are weak, and their hearts easily disregard reason, no matter how much they've made up their minds.</p>

<p>Will I give up again?</p>

<p>Will I leave Nagi behind, waiting in the darkness of her body, lonely and waiting for my return?</p>

<p>She's waiting for me to find a cure for AMS.</p>

<p>I might be able to save her if I try hard enough.</p>

<p>If I can see the truth with these eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll save you, Nagi. Just wait a little longer. I'll definitely save you. Then,&quot;</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>&quot;Nagi might be able to smile again!!&quot;</p>

<p>My heart screams out, and a fire is lit once more.</p>

<p>It's okay to be broken, isn't it?</p>

<p>I'm weak, I've known that for a long time.</p>

<p>But it's fine if I can get back up one more time, right?</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Once more. Just one more time&#8230; I'll do my best.&quot;</p>

<p>So, I take up my sword and face forward.</p>

<p>My fragile heart barely manages to hold on.</p>

<p>As if responding to my feelings.</p>

<p>As if responding to my heart.</p>

<p>My eyes shine a golden hue, unleashing their true power.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>CLANG!!</p>

<p>I clearly see the sword coming down and manage to block it more surely than ever before.</p>

<p>The White Knight, surprised because the something enveloping them seemed to shake violently.</p>

<p>Just like the wavering mirage, the White Knight's shape was revealed as something took form, materializing the previously invisible figure.</p>

<p>The gray world is dyed gold, reflecting magical power onto the world.</p>

<p>&quot;Could this be... magic?&quot;</p>

<p>What I saw, based on conjecture, was likely magical power.</p>

<p>Golden colored magic, like flames, is visible from my body.</p>

<p>A similar thing is leaking from the White Knight as well.</p>

<p>Perhaps flustered by the fact that I perfectly blocked them, the White Knight hurriedly swings their sword at me again.</p>

<p>However, I unmistakably saw the invisible sword, and I deflected it.</p>

<p>In terms of stats, I have the upper hand; there's no reason for me to lose.</p>

<p>Swords clash with swords, and power collides with power.</p>

<p>And in the end, if souls clash against each other as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhhh!!!&quot;</p>

<p>There's no reason for me to lose to a silent, nameless knight.</p>

<p>I have a goal to achieve, someone I want to save.</p>

<p>I have a reason I must win!!</p>

<p>With all my strength, I push the White Knight back against the wall.</p>

<p>Desperately resisting, the White Knight's skill &#12302;Mirage&#12303;is dispelled.</p>

<p>I continue to push relentlessly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ahhhhhh!!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>I'll settle this here; I'm about to lose consciousness anyway.</p>

<p>So, I will definitely settle this here.</p>

<p>I devote all my strength.</p>

<p>A single sword dances through the air with a metallic sound.</p>

<p>It was the enemy's sword, while mine was still gripped firmly in my hand.</p>

<p>With golden eyes, I gaze straight at the White Knight and point the tip of my sword directly at them.</p>

<p>As if smiling, the White Knight says something.</p>

<p>&#12302;&#8230;Impressive. Knight of this era. &#12303;</p>

<p>My sword pierces straight through the White Knight's chest.</p>

<p>I fall to the ground with the White Knight, leaning my weight on them.</p>

<p>Within my fading consciousness, my victory is announced by that emotionless voice.</p>
