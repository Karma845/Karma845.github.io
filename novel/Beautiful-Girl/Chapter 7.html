<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey Ren, teach me how to study.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I don’t want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school, leaving the classroom, I rejected Kyoya’s request, who was begging me desperately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Now, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s that…It’s really bad this time, I will really fail!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then study”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t know what to do and how!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Read the textbook”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be unreasonable!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not unreasonable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya grabbed my arm with both his hands while shouting and wasn’t letting go.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is really annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I am in the hallway outside the class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m making Kyoya cry, so it stands out a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I dragged Kyoya back into the class and sat down on a nearby seat to speak with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you go along with his flow, you will lose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, about the test. It’s a term-end examination that will be held next week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Interm exam, half-year exam, etc)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The club activities are also closed so that the students can go home and devote their time to studying instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why don’t you ask Satsuki.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, Satsuki is no better in studying than I am.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seriously…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looks like she’d be smart because she is Tachibana’s friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if she is no better than Kyoya, then she’s in for a lot of trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have so many friends, there has got to be someone who can help you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But you’re good at teaching. You have the best methods and you can do the exam in a record time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I’m going to go home and relax for today.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t have a plan, that’s good. You can help me out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a plan to relax, it’s very important.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your best friend’s dire request is much more important.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like he isn’t going to back down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I don’t have any plans, and I will anyway be forced to accept his request whether I like it or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fine, I get it. You owe me a meal, got it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OH! As expected,! I knew you&#8217;d accept in the end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m serious, now I’m going home.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m Kidding! Just kidding! I owe you a meal, ok?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya gave me a salute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…He’s not a bad person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s join now!”   (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? What are you joining? (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyoya! Are you there?” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was leaning my head to Kyoya’s mysterious words, Satsuki looked in from the hallway’s window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point making a rumor, it’ll only be a shadow. Satsuki is usually looking for Kyoya.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh. Satsuki, you’re back, how did it go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It went good. I brought back both of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a very proud posture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if to respond to that voice, two girls appeared out of the window across Hinata.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The last test results, the second and seventh place arrive!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya and Hinata started to make random excited noises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Hinata’s friends, Tachibana Rika and Susami Chitose, who looked stunned at the 2 of them.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami was wearing the same glasses and ponytail as the other day, giving out a very mature aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, Tachibana, with a strong atmosphere and a dignified presence, attracted the gaze of many people all around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tachibana’s eyes reached me, she looked away for a moment and bowed to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami, on the other hand, smiled and shook her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, these 2 were actually such high rankers?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that Tachibana could study.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Susami also seems to be smart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This guy here pulled in 9th place last time.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yup! Kusuba can only study.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey! Don’t say “only””</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that’s true actually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, Kusuba-san, you’re unexpectedly smart!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Susami who spoke first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what Hinata said, Susami came 2nd place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not happy to be praised by such a person, but I’ll accept it for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, there are other things I can do too.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, there are other good things about Kusuba-san too.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good things</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh Chitose, and Satsuki, let’s go now. We have to study, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana suddenly spoke to interrupt the conversation between me and Susami.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s up with Tachibana?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s acting strange today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, it’s what it is.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that we have the best teacher, our test is safe. Isn’t it, Satsuki?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Aim and avoid the red dots.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, you have really low ambition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Kyoya and Hinata collaborated to gather the people who would help them to study for the test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we&#8217;re going to have a study group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, this normie is really good at getting people involved with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, Let’s to the food court in front of the station.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that even allowed there?”</span></p>
l<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, if you order something from there, then it’s fine. It looks like Satsuki will give us some ice-cream.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t have Kusuba-san’s share though” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine because Kyoya will treat me”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This couple’s thought process is completely the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, the 5 of us left the classroom together,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya and the other seemed used to this, but it was my first time. So, I was having trouble finding my position in the group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do normies like him always walk the hallway like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, who was standing behind us all, came closer to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might be talking to Tachibana for the first time after we went to watch the movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t usually study, do you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Yeah, I don’t”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;and you still came at 9th place. Say, you and Chitose don’t even know the efforts others make.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana glared at me with a grudge-like expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you say something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe God just adjusted my status to be smart but have a terrible personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I was beaten by Kyoya before when I said this, so let&#8217;s not dare say it again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Doesn’t Susami study? She looks quite serious. Moreover, she also came 2nd place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She’s amazing, not only study, she is really good at sports, moreover, she’s also beautiful, and her style is also good”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, God, you made a mistake adjusting my status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aren’t you just giving Susami all my negative points?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, if Chitose has a drawback”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;she’s mean”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Malicious, ill-tempered, etc)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I hadn’t talked a lot with Susami, that was quite convincing.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.2</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now then, both of you try these 8 exercises for now”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study group advanced under the leadership of Susami.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, there is no need for 3 people to teach them, so I left early and read the textbook, memorizing the content.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ehhh~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chitose, aren’t you making it tough?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also 2 idiots complaining from the start.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Susami&#8217;s chosen problem was a fundamental part of the mathematics exam this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Susami is trying to grasp the degree of understanding the 2 had.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She may also be trying to measure their motivation for studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In order to teach, it is better to first clarify what the student knows and what he does not know. There will be a visible difference or else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a convincing reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana also nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the couple thought a bit differently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But it is hard to solve the problems so suddenly!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We&#8217;re slow starters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am telling you; I am just here to help you improve your grades. I don&#8217;t remember speaking on the part that motivated you. If you’re not motivated, I&#8217;m going home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami said in a small quiet voice, with a chilling smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Kyoya and Hinata&#8217;s faces freeze, cold sweat blots go down their forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, even I was scared just now…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was this cold, icy anger that cannot come from a mature adult aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, what Susami says is quite reasonable actually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have asked someone to teach you, I think you should also have a certain attitude.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motivation of the person is not important when your goal is to improve your grades.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, neither of them would’ve guessed that Susami could be so scary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked over to Tachibana, she was completely silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, you won’t be able to do it without any motivation, right? So, do you want to continue…you won’t do it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah… I-I will do it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Umm… I&#8217;ll do it too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright then, solve the problem”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami briefly said so with a smile and took a sip of her milk tea.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hold my head and sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their struggling, both of them started to solve the problems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Tachibana and I calmly studied on our own, and Susami was watching the 2 solving her questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like Susami is seriously trying to teach the 2 of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So maybe Tachibana and I won’t need to help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you can’t solve it, don’t get frustrated. I’ll teach you little by little according to your current level. I won’t put an unnecessary burden on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, sensei”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had become completely tame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, looking at the current performances of these 2, it would be better if she is a bit strict.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m done!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I did it too!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them finished the question at the exact same time and presented them to Susami.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I take a quick glance at the sheet, but can’t understand what’s written.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami looked at the 2 sheets of paper and took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;this is serious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You, it looked serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that was to be expected.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m tired…” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Me too…” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being taught by Susami for about three hours, they finally found their guts to make a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya slumped on the table as if he completely exhausted his energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, both of them unexpectedly did their best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought they’d quit long before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Y-yes, sensei”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Kyoya and Hinata were exhausted, they obeyed obediently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two who were quite reluctant to study seemed to have considerably changed their personality in the past 3 hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that was probably because of Susami.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, she is really good at teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only is her explanations easy to understand, but also that she can immediately see where and why the other person is stuck or unable to comprehend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she would scold, but praise as well.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The efficiency of teaching and the management of the motivation was perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Susami mentioned that she hasn’t really intended to motivate them, it was definitely due to Susami that they were able to study for so long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Tachibana and I hardly helped, instead we spent our time studying and talking to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, Susami did everything so perfectly that we didn’t need to help at all, whether we wanted to or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, we ate what we liked for dinner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is obviously no need to say that Kyoya bought me dinner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, there was something else that happened…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　The topic of conversation during the meal, very reluctantly, was about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba is really dark, isn’t he? Won&#8217;t he have an influence on Rika?” (Hinata)</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Shut up.” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nah, he won’t. Kusuba-san doesn’t have much of an influence.” (Kyoya)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, come one” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I mean, I&#8217;m happy that Ren can make friends with a girl, and that too with Tachibana-san” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, apparently, Kyoya actually became teary-eyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really wish he could be happy or make fun of me instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought Kusuba-kun was more of a “twisted person” because of what Satsuki had told me. But he’s unexpectedly normal.” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, Ren’s completely normal, just that he’s a bit dark.” (Kyoya)</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Stop it.” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He helped Rika out, and forgave Satsuki immediately, he’s got some good qualities.”  (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Kusuba-san is rather a good person” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230; just don’t get carried away too much” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I won’t get carried away, I’m always in my worst shape.” (Ren) &#8212;- ^</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My demeaning response caused all of us, the normies and I, to suddenly start laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, I felt a strange feeling of satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a clear line of difference between making others laugh and being laughed at…this actually doesn’t feel bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speaking of which, I heard you had a fight with Satsuki, Kusuba-san.” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chitose…that’s enough…” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fight?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, the time where Hinata apologized before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t really a fight, it was something similar.” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey! Shut up, you!” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinata had blots of sweat going down her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that she still cares about what happened at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please forgive her. Satsuki is very close to Rika. So, she is just protective of boys approaching her.” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know. That’s why I didn’t really mind. I already forgave her.”(Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m relieved. Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami’s voice seemed to be thanking me from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not often that I hear someone speaking like this, so I felt somewhat weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But Satsuki and Kusuba-kun have a complex relationship, don’t they?” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s because Ren and Satsuki have a cat-and-dog relationship” (Kyoya)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: Actually, it’s dog and monkey, but in English, it becomes cat and dog.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If anything, I&#8217;m a frog and Hinata is a snake” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get scared when I’m glared at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why do you hate him so much?&#8221; (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;it’s not like I hate him…” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You even went through the trouble of giving Tachibana a message for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: In previous chapters, when she apologizes, but later sends a message saying she still hates him)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s just that I get really annoyed when I see you…”  (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Straight to the point.” (Susami)</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even though you said you&#8217;ve given up everything, but in reality, you haven&#8217;t given up at all. You would be more desperate, but actually, you&#8217;re not. You&#8217;re impatient, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hinata said that, she took a mouthful of pasta and stuffed it, looking embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a bit surprising that she had thought like that, and that she said it so bluntly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well…even I don’t know the circumstances, so, maybe, it’s not really that easy.” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But you know what, I don&#8217;t like the fact that I&#8217;m the only one who&#8217;s annoyed&#8230; But after all, it&#8217;s irritating&#8230; Agh, whatever, we&#8217;re done with this conversation!&#8221; (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After shouting the end, Hinata sat down to eat her dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami, who was next to her, smiled and stroked her head.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around as I felt a gaze upon me, Tachibana shrugged her shoulders with a surprised, but happy face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we were leaving, Kyoya called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You and Satsuki get along surprisingly well.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t say something like that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m serious. By the way, you’re getting along pretty well with Tachibana, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…In a way”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gooood! I like it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should be friends with Hinata”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t care how many friends I have!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya just laughed at my reply and ran up to Hinata, suddenly hugging her from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They seemed quite a happy couple, even though Hinata was bright red while hitting Kyoya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you do something like that without being embarrassed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">…It doesn’t really matter how many friends you have, right?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that may be right.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your friend accepts you properly, it’s, of course, better to have many friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t always work that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or at least, not for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tachibana called me, I suddenly raised my head which was facing downward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What are you doing, let&#8217;s go hoMe early”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Tachibana and I have already become friends.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.4</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study sessions continued day after day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Kyoya and Hinata were surprisingly motivated, calling the 3 of us on a daily basis. To be honest, I felt that Susami was enough to teach them, why did she need me and Tachibana for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she said, “If Rika and Kusuba-kun don’t come, I won’t either”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of what Susami said, Tachibana and I were also forced to participate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forcing me, a guy who himself says that he&#8217;s rather timid, to go along with them was just what I&#8217;d expect from a group of normies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, both of you can do these at home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya and Hinata&#8217;s energetic reply concluded today&#8217;s study session. This is the fourth day of studying, for about 3 hours every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s going on unexpectedly well. Is it because of Susami’s teachings and motivation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyoya, do you want to exchange the fried chicken with Takoyaki?” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that’s fine. The one without lemon, please” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are Rika and Kusuba-kun eating the same thing again?” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all ordered something we liked and ate together on a table. This was a meal for normies but was now normal for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a student council meeting tomorrow, so you’ll have to do it without me tomorrow, I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After everyone had finished eating, Susami told us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;EH?! No…Sensei…” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Chitose…” (Hinata)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s only for tomorrow, and Rika and Kusuba-kun will be there” (Susami)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya and Hinata were mourning over Susami’s words with tears.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that they had become our students before we could even make out what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, are there any school activities before the test?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks to the absence of club activities, everyone can study for the test instead. Though when the test is over, there will be a whole school assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whole school assembly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That reminds me, there was such a plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would probably go to bed without listening to anything, but when I think of someone taking the time to prepare for all that, I feel a bit sad for them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well&#8230; that doesn’t mean I’ll seriously participate in something like that.</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am the secretary; I work behind the scenes. I leave the speeches to the people who are good at talking”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami replied, with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This girl definitely looks good enough to hold a microphone and speak on the stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure if the student council is a group of people like Susami, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that’s so, I wouldn’t want to be close to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time, after we all went to go home, I naturally ended up with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had already gotten used to going home together with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of you are doing great!” (Susami)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn’t want to, of course. But he came to my house every day and was very persistent so I had no choice.”  (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because I had hope in you.” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you even want to know that?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought of answering that, but looking at her, she probably won&#8217;t back down until she hears an answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m thinking about it.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why&#8230;it&#8217;s a difficult question to answer…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While answering, I started thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I think Kyoya is a friend.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean to say, what makes friends different from others who are not friends?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I had said it’s difficult to answer, the conclusion was surprisingly easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Because the sense of distance between us is appropriate” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;meaning?” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh…no…I mean, He knows when not to go ahead. He knows precisely where the line is, and never crosses it. Like, if he knows I’ll get angry or irritated, he’ll never cross that line.”  (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Hmm”(Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I know if I distance myself more, our relationship will break. That’s why I can’t cut him off, or to be more honest, I don’t want to either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying all that, I felt my face getting hotter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t mean to speak so frankly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was unneeded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked over to Tachibana while these thoughts ran in my mind, contrary to my expectations, had her hand on her chin with a mysterious look.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I think that’s a nice relationship. Natsume-san loves Kusuba-san and Kusuba-san loves Natsume-san just as much.” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;That’s hard to affirm, actually” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a very misleading way of saying it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the end, that’s probably right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, there is no way our relationship continued till this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Tachibana was nodding with satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What on earth was she so happy about?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if she’s teasing me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tachibana is also loved a lot by 2 people, isn’t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with an intention of getting back at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’s true when you think about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, where Susami approached me by herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hinata, who is hostile towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them were very compassionate towards Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s a bit straightforward &amp; clumsy.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know how Tachibana actually is, you also know you just can’t leave her alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No…it’s actually the opposite…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Opposite…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love them more than they do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana spoke in a small voice, strangely tickling me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nodded and seemed to be chewing on her own words.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.5</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: They left the restaurant and are on their way home)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Being such an inflexible, uncooperative, and selfish person. They can still be friends with me naturally. That&#8217;s why I truly love them both.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s how it is. Even though I’m not as bad as Kusuba-san in socializing, I’m not good at it. It’s just like that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just like that, huh…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is hard to get along with and cold.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the first impression of Tachibana one might have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She definitely is not the type of person who gets along with everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it rudely, Tachibana disguises this fact with her beautiful appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…obviously…it’s hard to tell, but she’s actually a naturally caring and honest person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she wasn’t, she wouldn’t be cared so much for by 2 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they wouldn’t be friends with her either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, I’m really grateful to them. And I’m sure that Natsume-san is the same way to you. Even though it might be a bit different.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana gave a faint smile while I was slightly tilting my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…It’s alright, you’ll come to understand it eventually.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope so&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana shakes his head from side to side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve already run out of shame I had today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sorry, but I’ll have to give up now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But, I’m glad that Kusuba-san seems to be enjoying the study group”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don’t have to observe unnecessary things like that, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But, wouldn’t it be nice to see everyone getting along with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;no, not really”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“humph…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, who pouted as if she was sulking, was as cute as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the sudden difference between the current face and the usual face makes it even cuter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;5 people is not a large crowd.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just wrong.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five of us hanging out together and having fun was something really new to me, but it was surprisingly easy and fun, so I was a bit confused.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this progress?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or is it just temporary?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I have never felt such an experience before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I mean…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, 2 people. That’s the limit”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, a car passed us while we were walking near the corner of the road.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I frowned at the deafening sound of the engine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An awkward silence fell between me and Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, we didn&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t ask her anything, neither did she continue the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We just walked towards our home in silence and spoke in a friendly tone when we were to part.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.6</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The days of the daily study sessions with everyone was over like a flash, everyone passed the midterm exam easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: It’s actually, “passed like a storm”)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The test format was the same as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I did much better than usual as I had more time to study this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami, who was acting like a teacher, didn’t seem to care about her own results but was rather more concerned about her student&#8217;s results instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, speaking of both of them…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;shut up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was lunch break when all the papers were given back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 of us gathered in front of the bulletin board where the test results were posted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top 20 students with the best score, the failing red line, the average score, the distribution of the scores, were posted on the board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never realized how much data was presented there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time I had seen it properly, so I was a little surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m more of a genius! My total score was higher than yours, Kyoya! Being the top of the grade is not a dream anymore!” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two idiots were in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami just smiled at them while Tachbana clapped admiringly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I think they worked really hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I feel that Susami’s contribution is greater than those 2 themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them seemed to understand that somehow, as they thanked Susami many times.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Chitose”  (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. However, keep studying regularly, and don’t slack off. If you do, you’ll go back down again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…got it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a clear, feelingless reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susami also seems to have seen through that and shrugged her should looking amazed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As expected of Teacher&#8230;but there are people who have better grades than Susami-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked at the board, there was indeed Susami’s name in the list of outstanding grades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person in question had a small, wry smile and looked uncomfortable. I don&#8217;t know how she feels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always the same person who comes in first, isn’t it? The school’s vice-president.” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The student council is really smart” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Also, Kusuba is 6th, and Tachibana is 8th” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This…we were so happy about our grades…but now it’s so pitiful” (Kyoya) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya and Hinata turned around and dropped their shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think I’ll start becoming pessimistic if my score has risen a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean anything to compare yourself with others. The 2 of you worked hard and got a good score. That’s what I see.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Haha, You’re out” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got surprised as they started to shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, I am not good with a place where there are many people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to leave Kyoya and the others who were still making a fuss and went back to the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going through the crowd, I finally went away from the bulletin board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt as if I had escaped from a deep swamp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I turned towards the person who spoke, I saw Tachibana fixing her ruffled uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, it seems that she also left early.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After we nodded to each other, we walked to the classroom together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only a short distance, so it’d look unnatural to keep a distance from her here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, see you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke to each other as if we were normal friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It must have been a great progress to advance so much that I can have a normal conversation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An event came as soon as the midterm test was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: not the usual rom-com cultural fest)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an extracurricular even where the whole class goes to a museum or art gallery by bus to experience a variety of cultures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole day, the students can visit any place they want to visit first, in any order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see in this explanation, the event is for the normies who are completely satisfied with their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teachers seemed to treat it like a social gathering rather than a study session. The places you could visit include zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, and other places that seemed to be more for going out.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got off the bus, and for some reason, the 5 of us gathered together like it was normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be more precise, Kyoya stopped me from quickly escaping the group and this is what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let’s just have fun today!” (Kyoya)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes!” (Hinata)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I joined the group, I saw Kyoya and Hinata shouting, not caring about their surroundings at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They then started to discuss where they would go and when while I was just in the background.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure, but we have to report later, right?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We have to go to at least one actual place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If not, it would have been the best trip ever”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we were talking like this, the students around started to scatter and go to their destinations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small group, a large one, and couples. Everyone was obviously going around with someone else</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…Sorry, but Satsuki and I will be going alone together.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sorry… Rika… Chitose”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s alright. Please take your time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, have a nice time, see you later.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bye Ren! Take care of Tachibana and the other.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya took Hinata away while giving me a wink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was being selfish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve already decided to go around these events by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m going with the other group. Take care of Rika, Kusuba-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;C-chitose?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana reacted in a dissatisfied manner for some reason.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, leaving such Tachibana behind, Susami also quickly joins the other group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected of a normie. Even at such a time, she could go join so many other places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL: He means that Chitose can easily join another group without any issues because she has many friends as a “normie”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana and I were left back alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were not many people around now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started at each other and nodded our heads at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heh…Well then”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We turned our back to each other deliberately and started walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We shall go where we want to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s our way. Even though we are friends, we won’t want to do things together that we don’t even want to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*(TL: One person wants to go to place “A”, other to place “B”. SO, there is no point going together to where one doesn’t want to.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly thought of deciding where to go without taking a look back.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.7</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow! The whales are amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s also a dolphin show, let’s go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Look, the tropical fish is so cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My destination, out of all the options, was the aquarium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of so many options, this was the only place I wanted to go to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the other students from the school look at the bigger tanks, I gaze at the smaller ones on the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like aquariums.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, I like the fish tanks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve always liked to look at the rocks, seaweed, and sand in the tanks rather than the fishes swimming gracefully around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not only the layout but also the texture of the rocks with the color which is so realistically produced along with the algae that are growing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t get the same feeling even from an actual ocean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like seeing the fishes lurking in the shadows of the tank, or hiding between the rocks. I preferred these to the actual fish swimming in plain sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I am the only one who thinks like that, I wouldn’t expect you to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that&#8217;s also the reason I wanted to come here by myself.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aquarium at the far end of the room caught my eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior of the tank was exceptionally well-built, looking as if it had been cut out from the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, all the fish in that tank were rather plain and I didn’t know which one were they.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, most of the people didn’t stop by here, just gave It a glace and walked past it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought of staying here for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to stay here for a while. I bent down a bit and my face went closer to the tank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The view was such that it could make you sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tank’s inside was small.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, there were tanks that are really big, but when compared to the ocean, they are so small that they become insignificant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fishes will live in such a world for the rest of their lives. But nothing seems to be the problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They will live contended and die as such.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also want such a life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual ocean is quite scary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the big world outside will not be good for someone small like me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the only way for me to live happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, I feel like my world has expanded a little unexpectedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh…Kusuba-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…too many deja vus…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, Tachibana was standing right next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without being surprised at all, we just stood side by side and looked at the tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re at the aquarium too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m only here for one purpose. I want to see the aquarium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Not the fish?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I like aquariums. It’s like a mini ocean, so I’m quite attracted to it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. Especially this tank. It’s a masterpiece.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Yes”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t say anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Tachibana seemed to have understood the current situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;If you want to have a look around, you can. I’ll stay here.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m staying here. I like it here too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exhaling a small breath, Tachibana slowly crouched beside me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the dim light inside the aquarium, Tachibana looked much more beautiful than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blue light drifted from the aquarium and dimly lit Tachibana’s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can I ask you one thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, all the noise around me mysteriously disappeared.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, it really seemed like the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.8</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;no”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;EH?! Why not?! I haven’t even said anything yet.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Heh… alright, alright, what is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s really worth teasing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why can’t you make any friends?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana again asked me this same question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have told you before. It&#8217;s because I have a bad personality.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s exactly what you said last time. That you are not suitable for socializing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;If you say so”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, do you remember what I said at that time?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana said so as she then slowly looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that it was from the time we were returning from the public bath together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started tracing my memory.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I immediately found the correct answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right, Tachibana was there at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I said, I do not think so” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;that’s right…and?” (Ren)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My feelings have not changed even now. Kusuba-san is a kind person. I know that myself. But still, how did it turn out like this…? I want to know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was unexpectedly serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know why I have to tell her that.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it wasn’t Tachibana who asked me that, I would have probably responded that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it seems I have now come to trust her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she pushed me to this extent, I hardly felt uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why are you even asking me that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I have told you before. I love Satsuki and Chitose.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So you did.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m really happy to be friends with them. I’m also happy to be friends with Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…is that so.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. And I’m sure you can also make such friends, Kusuba-san. Because you have a kind heart.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Tachibana said all that, she again started at the Tank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can tell by looking at her that she was nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the first time I saw a thoughtful expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Rather, what you’re saying is wrong. I am not saying that you can have many friends or have to, because that’s not what I meant…What I am trying to say is that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s okay, you don’t have to be so wordy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won&#8217;t just get hurt from a few words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than that, I want to know what Tachibana’s thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just simply wanted to hear what my friend wanted to say to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I want you to have many more friends. You deserve to be loved more, Kusuba-san.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could feel the back of my nose getting hotter. My eyes were starting to hurt and my eyelashes were a little wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana didn’t notice all this but instead stared at a single point in the tank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I became like this in junior high school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I wanted to tell Tachibana about myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, rather, I wanted Tachibana to listen to my story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even on a school trip in junior high school, I was watching the tanks by myself like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;is that so?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then one of my friends, who I use to talk with relatively well…told me I was creepy, that I was disgusting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana doesn’t look at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She just listened to me, a little sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was stupid. Being an idiot, I tried to explain to him the good points of the aquarium. But he said, ‘I don’t get it’”.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face had expressions of disgust and disdain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strangely distorted mouth, like you have found a traitor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had thought of them as my friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just because you don’t understand something, how does it become creepy? There are things that I don’t understand, but I don’t that way. But there are people who do think like that.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s right”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And this didn’t just happen once or twice either. If to make friends, I can’t do what I want to do and say what I want to say, then I don’t need friends. For me, I’m the most important person. If I have to care about what others think of me, then I don’t need friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana touched the tank.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water droplets were wiped away, and some flowed down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a faint sound of breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Tachibana spoke in a wet voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;But I still want to be friends with Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vision wavered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t see the tank’s interior anymore, and my teeth were trembling.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt as if some unknown feelings were coming up from deep within me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…how…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started crying at the corner of the aquarium, trying to stifle my voice and cowering down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;K-kusuba-san? Are you alright…?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;No, it’s nothing, it’s nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana stood up and came closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a soft feeling on my head, slowly stroking my hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time she stroked my head, more tears would flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept wiping them away with the sleeves of my clothes, but they never stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have never talked to anyone like this before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had never been told that they wanted me to have friends, or wanted to be friends with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I just don’t believe that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Even if you can’t, it’s still true.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m fine with being alone&#8230;If you’re going to leave me one day, then I don’t want to do this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m your friend right now. Even if I may leave, I’m still your friend who loves you the way you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just cried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My shoulders trembling, not caring about shame or what was happening around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embracing a girl, I just cried.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.9</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the bus was dropped off at a roundabout in front of the station, and we went our own ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already quite dark, so not many students were planning to make a detour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them went to the station, some walked to their homes, and others went their own ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After parting my ways with Kyoya and the others, I started walking my way home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was someone next to me, whose house was close to mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it was Tachibana Rika.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still haven’t spoken a word to each other ever since we left the aquarium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just how should I face her and talk to he?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know what to say or how so I just kept silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had put a solid line of precaution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I am to be rejected one day, I’d better stay away from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I am to be alone again, I would rather not make any friends.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I never looked for someone who even wanted to be my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought that I was fine, that there was no one else other than Kyoya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if there was someone like that, I didn’t want to bother looking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Rika Tachibana came.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she wanted to be friends with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she wanted me to be loved more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she said all that, I cried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just so happy that I cried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s juts how simple I am.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end…I was just looking for someone like her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just wanted her to say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though this won’t change who I am, I’m just so happy to see that there is someone who would accept me for who I was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I spoke of anything else, I wanted to thank her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…For being beside me when I cried</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…For the words you said to me</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…And, for being beside me now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““…Um…””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looked at me with a somewhat relieve expression and shook her head, urging me to continue first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I’m sorry about today”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why? you didn’t do anything wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Um… I mean, Did I embarrass you? I just started to cry like that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a bit embarrassing, but I don’t it’s anything to apologize about. It was my decision to stay with you when you cried.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…even if you say that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana laughed as she looked at me at who was at loss of words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Thank you, for various things.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Various things…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, just various things…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, not ‘Eh’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but laugh at Tachibana&#8217;s childish response, different from her usual self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We laughed as we walked beside each other at the dead of night.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone saw us, it might have been a very creepy sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I’ve decided.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What did you decide?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t care about the rumours or unwanted attention anymore. I’ll do what I want to do, and if someone wants something from me, I won’t reject them.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;is that so”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There will be more people who will just leave, but as long as I have Kyoya and Tachibana, I don’t care. It’s because of you both I am who I am today. So, everything will work out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see. I don’t know if that’s good or bad though.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tachibana seemed glad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing that reaction, even I started feeling the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I think it&#8217;s good. It’s nice to see you like this.” (Tachibana) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, it’s not such a big deal. It’s a small change in my personality.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I think the most important thing is the way you’re supposed to think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sound like some old lady.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Sound like an old lady?! I don’t sound like an old lady!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I meant in a good way? An old woman in a good way.” </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana’s footsteps become smaller as if she’s sulking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While glancing back a bit, I also slow down my speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m hungry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Grilled meat?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I meant your cooking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh? Why on such a day?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…how about this be the return of the favour for the lightning day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And again, we walked slowly side by side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana who had seemed to become unhappy, came back to the soft expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please help me with the shopping”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course,”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Any specific requests?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something I can make.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really? I must give it a serious thought then.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t get your expectations too high.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I have to. The food last time was so good.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is too much pressure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Pressure makes a person stronger.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t seem to be under a lot of pressure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, come one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My heart feels light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel completely at ease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s definitely because of Tachibana I’m able to feel this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tachibana”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you, really”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Again? You already thanked me.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t care how many times I say it. That’s how much I appreciate you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;is that so”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, so that’s why, Thank you.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;No, we’re friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As expected of my friend.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’re getting too carried away.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looked at me with a frown on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To escape from her gaze, I quickly increased my walking pace as to not let her see the grin on my face.</span></p>
