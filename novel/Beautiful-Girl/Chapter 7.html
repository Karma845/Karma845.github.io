<h2>Chapter 7: Forest School Episode</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p> <br />At the end of April, when cherry blossoms had completely fallen, and green leaves started to appear on the trees here and there,<br /> <br />the first-year students of Seira High School were on a bus heading to a remote training facility for their forest school.<br /> <br />“Did you watch the manager’s video yesterday?”<br /> <br />“It was so interesting, right?”<br /> <br />“Our tactics are getting a lot of attention because of that video.”<br /> <br />“Oh, really? That’s amazing. What was it, like ‘cute’ or ‘peek-a-boo with the little bit of her bra showing’?”<br /> <br />“Oh no! Delete, delete, delete!”<br /> <br />“…Ugh. This is bad; I feel like I’m going to throw up.”<br /> <br />As the students chatted excitedly on the bus,<br /> <br />there was one guy grimacing with discomfort.<br /> <br />His name was Saito Minazuki,<br /> <br />a foolish high schooler who, despite being in high school, was looking forward to the overnight stay and ended up pulling an all-nighter.<br /> <br />As a result, he was now struggling with motion sickness, something he usually didn’t experience, and was currently battling nausea and discomfort.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Hey, I’ve got a bag ready anytime. Come on. No, actually, don’t come.”<br /> <br />“Preparation is pointless if you’re not going to use it, Akashi-kun.”<br /> <br />“Itochi, want some candy? Apparently, eating spicy habanero candy helps a bit. It’s delicious!”<br /> <br />“…I’ll pass. If I eat that, I might die for real.”<br /> <br />“But if you eat it and die, you’ll be released from this suffering.”<br /> <br />“…Nice idea, Kanzaki. Yakumo, give me one.”<br /> <br />“Okay.”<br /> <br />“Wait, don’t take it seriously. Don’t eat it! It was my bad.”<br /> <br />“Haha, it’s the first time I’ve seen Minaka-chan panicking like this. Oh, and by the way, Minazuki, want some chocolate too? It’s effective.”<br /> <br />“…I’ll eat.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />With various care (or not) from his friends, Saito managed to endure.<br /> <br />However, with over an hour left until they reached their destination, the prospect of enduring was disheartening.<br /> <br />Would he make it through until they arrived?<br /> <br />Staring at the large mountain outside the window, Saito felt anxious.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />An hour and a half later.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“All right!! We finally made it!”<br /> <br />In the end, everything went smoothly.<br /> <br />That’s because Saito fell asleep around thirty minutes into the journey.<br /> <br />Eating the chocolate Lily gave him somewhat alleviated the discomfort, and the overwhelming sleepiness from the all-nighter took over.<br /> <br />Before he knew it, the remaining time passed quickly in the comfort of his dreams.<br /> <br />However, the difficulty he experienced until then didn’t change, and as soon as he got off the bus, he cheered.<br /> <br />(Ground that doesn’t sway is the best!)<br /> <br />Saito relishes the greatness of treading on the earth.<br /> <br />“Hey, Saito, don’t just stand there in front of the door. Move a bit back.”<br /> <br />“Sorry.”<br /> <br />However, he couldn’t bask in the afterglow as Lily pointed out that he was obstructing the passage.<br /> <br />“Thank you.”<br /> <br />“Over there, it looks like a gathering.”<br /> <br />“Okay, Haruki. Your zipper is open.”<br /> <br />“Whoa, really? Since when? Did someone see it?”<br /> <br />“When we parked in the parking lot, some girls from our class saw it.”<br /> <br />“Lies! Why didn’t you tell me, Kai kun?”<br /> <br />“I was planning to observe when you’d notice.”<br /> <br />Thanking the driver and picking up the luggage they had entrusted, the friends and students headed towards the accommodation where everyone was gathering.<br /> <br />“Everyone from Group 3, this way! The order of the groups doesn’t matter, so class leaders, please take attendance and report to the teacher.”<br /> <br />“Okay, roll call.”<br /> <br />Arriving at the accommodation, Homeroom Teacher Chie Hayama instructed the class leaders to take attendance.<br /> <br />Saito, chosen as the class leader by rock-paper-scissors, glanced back to confirm that all members were present.<br /> <br />The team consisted of six members:<br /> <br />Saito, Kai, Haruki, Lily, Shuri, and Minaka.<br /> <br />Since the childhood friends wanted to be in the same group, that’s how the team was formed.<br /> <br />Although they had already confirmed that everyone was present since they were sitting close to each other on the bus, Saito double-checked the count.<br /> <br />“Three, six. Alright, everyone’s here. Hayama-chan, all members of Group 5 are present.”<br /> <br />Satisfied that everyone was present, Saito reported loudly to Chie.<br /> <br />“Understood. Thank you, Minazuki-kun. But, please don’t call me ‘Hayama-chan.'”<br /> <br />“Roger.”</p>




<p><br /> <br />At that moment, like the other class leaders, Saito received a scolding for using a nickname for the teacher, but since this was a usual occurrence, he casually brushed it off.<br /> <br />“Chie-chan-Sensei, everyone from Squad 4 is here.”<br /> <br />“Chie-chan, everyone from Squad 3 is here.”<br /> <br />“Oh, come on, everyone, stop with the playful names! Alright, now that we know everyone’s here, let me explain the plan for the next steps. Please open your bookmarks.”<br /> <br />The other group leaders called the teachers with nicknames like Saito did, Chie went on to review the upcoming schedule and extended greetings to those who would assist during the forest school.<br /> <br />Once done, the groups temporarily split into male and female teams, each placing their belongings in the assigned rooms.<br /> <br />Squad leader Saito received two keys from Chie and tossed one to the vice squad leader, Shuri.<br /> <br />“After thirty minutes, we’ll meet at the cafeteria, so don’t be late.”<br /> <br />“Got it. Lilicchi, Minacchi, let’s go.”<br /> <br />“Alright then, see you later, Saito.”<br /> <br />“Yo, let’s go too.”<br /> <br />Stressing the importance of not being late for the next meeting, Saito and his friends head towards the dorms after parting ways with the girls’ group.<br /> <br />“…Lily is still the same. Didn’t even mention the names of Kai and Haruki. Well, this is an event to deepen connections, does she even understand that?”<br /> <br />Along the way, Saito couldn’t help but be frustrated with the actions of his childhood friend.<br /> <br />“Machigane-san is known for hating guys, so it can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />“Even so, since we’re in the same group, at least be a bit friendlier.”<br /> <br />Haruki, being kind-hearted, tried to reassure Saito, but seeing Lily being cold even to his friends made him feel sorry.<br /> <br />“Don’t worry, Saito. I don’t mind, and Haruki is probably happy to be treated coldly.”<br /> <br />“Huh, really? Haruki, are you an M?”<br /> <br />“I’m normal. I’m not affected at all, Saito-kun. And Kai is just delighted to be treated coldly.”<br /> <br />“It’s a fact.”<br /> <br />“Kuhaha, I’m glad you guys are friends, really.”<br /> <br />“Blush.”<br /> <br />“Ahaha, this is pretty normal.”<br /> <br />However, despite Saito feeling down, his friends reassured him,<br /> <br />When Saito expressed my gratitude to them, Kai and Haruki scratched their cheeks in embarrassment and smiled shyly.<br /> <br />“It’s the first time someone said that to me.”<br /> <br />While scratching his cheek, Kai said something like that.<br /> <br />“It’s probably a joke. Haruki is interesting, short, and looks like a mascot character, so he was popular.”<br /> <br />But for Saito, who had been interacting with Kai for about a month, it was unbelievable that Kai had no friends.<br /> <br />Surely, it was just his usual joke.<br /> <br />“Not really. I have a blank expression, so people couldn’t understand what I was thinking, and they found it creepy.”<br /> <br />“What the hell, they have no taste. They should appreciate the interesting stuff he says with that expressionless face. Right, Haruki?”<br /> <br />“…Yeah, you’re right. It’s surprising that Kai didn’t have friends, considering how entertaining he is.”<br /> <br />Thinking that way, it seemed Kai truly didn’t have friends, and those he had met so far didn’t see the uniqueness in him.<br /> <br />Despite the generally expressionless demeanor, his emotions were clear, his way of speaking was peculiar and amusing, and he was skilled at taking photos.<br /> <br />There weren’t many people as entertaining as him.<br /> <br />When seeking agreement from Haruki about these guys wasting their potential, he shook his head in disbelief.<br /> <br />“My back feels itchy. Let’s go to the room already.”<br /> <br />Unable to endure the praise from his friends, Kai turned away and walked briskly.<br /> <br />“He’s terrible at hiding embarrassment.”<br /> <br />“It’s so obvious when you look at it like this.”<br /> <br />“Shut up. If you mock me any further, I’ll post a photo online of Saito puking, and Haruki staring at a girl’s panties.”<br /> <br />“Mine wouldn’t have much impact, but Haruki, yours peeking at a girl’s panties is a serious offense. It’s practically a crime.”<br /> <br />As the other two teased the embarrassed Kai, he threatened to spread photos online.<br /> <br />One of them, if released, would cause a major issue, and Saito distanced himself from Haruki, thinking he was staring at someone’s panties.<br /> <br />“No, that was an accident! I was just climbing the stairs, and a girl’s skirt happened to lift. I’m not at fault. And why do you have such a photo, Kai!?”<br /> <br />“I was trying to take a photo of the sunset from the emergency staircase, and it just happened.”<br /> <br />“Sometimes you act like the protagonist in a romantic comedy, Haruki.”<br /> <br />What started as teasing Kai ended up with roles reversed, with Haruki now at the receiving end.<br /> <br />While making fun of Kai, he had unwittingly become the target. As always, Haruki was being teased, and the three of them returned to their usual banter.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p> <br />Time passed, and two hours later.<br /> <br />After putting their belongings in the room and enjoying the lunch buffet, Saito, along with the members of his group, was currently walking through the forest.<br /> <br />“Doesn’t that mushroom look edible?”<br /> <br />“Wait. That’s the Stinkhorn mushroom, so it’s a no-go. You can eat it if you don’t mind having an upset stomach.”<br /> <br />“Ugh, seriously? I thought it could be used for dinner.”<br /> <br />At that moment, Saito, who happened to find a mushroom, tried to pick it, but Lily immediately intervened with a warning.<br /> <br />In her memory, this mushroom seemed to be poisonous and not edible.<br /> <br />The moment Saito heard that, he hastily withdrew the hand he had been reaching out.<br /> <br />“Amazing, Lilycchi. You’re knowledgeable. How can you identify mushrooms so well?”<br /> <br />“I saw it in a picture book when I was a kid. Well, at that time, I barely remembered it, but thanks to someone, I ended up memorizing it. Someone who wanted to eat nuts and mushrooms without thinking.”<br /> <br />Praising Lily for correctly identifying the mushroom that none of the team members knew, Shuri admired her, and she gave Saito a slightly annoyed look.<br /> <br />“Don’t cause trouble for Lily, you foolish moon.”<br /> <br />“Ouch. Why am I getting scolded when my name wasn’t even mentioned?”<br /> <br />“Because you’re the only one who would do something like that.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, Saito is an idiot, so he’d eat anything.”<br /> <br />” For now, I’ll eat anything that’s put in front of me.”<br /> <br />” I get it, I know exactly what you guys are thinking. Remember it for later, seriously.”<br /> <br />Although Saito thought he could keep it a secret from the other team members, it was evident to everyone as soon as they heard the story, and he ended up being beaten up.<br /> <br />Saito had taken action, thinking it would make dinner more luxurious, but he hadn’t expected to be beaten up like this. In retaliation, he decided to do something to the other team members during dinner.<br /> <br />Now, the reason Saito and the others are in the mountains is not for gathering ingredients,<br /> <br />but rather as part of the orientation for the forest school.<br /> <br />It’s a typical activity where teachers set up mysteries in various parts of the mountain. The students solve these mysteries, collect keywords, and finally come up with an answer. It’s commonly known as a treasure hunt game.<br /> <br />The time limit is two hours, and the area is reasonably extensive.<br /> <br />If they fail to answer the last question, the curry they make for dinner will be without any ingredients.<br /> <br />However, since the main theme is to deepen the interaction with team members, the school has designed it to be easily cleared by the students, like a light hiking activity.<br /> <br />“Wow.”<br /> <br />“Dangerous!”<br /> <br />However, being in the mountain, even if it’s managed, there are more risks due to uneven terrain.<br /> <br />Saito and the others had to be careful to avoid accidents.<br /> <br />Lily, whose attention was distracted by the surroundings, stumbled over a tree branch.<br /> <br />Just as she was about to fall, Haruki caught her in the nick of time.<br /> <br />“Are you okay?”<br /> <br />“…Thanks. I’m fine now. Can you let go?”<br /> <br />“Sorry. I’ll let go right away.”<br /> <br />Haruki, worried about whether Lily was injured, looked into her face.<br /> <br />Lily, showing a hint of disgust as their faces were uncomfortably close, asked him to let go, and Haruki immediately apologized and released her.<br /> <br />“It’s like a manga.”<br /> <br />(That’s true.)<br /> <br />Saito internally agreed with Minaka’s statement.<br /> <br />The series of events between the two could have been the beginning of a love story in a beautifully fictional world.<br /> <br />However, just as Saito was starting to think about it, he felt a dull pain in his chest.<br /> <br />“Lilycchi, are you okay? Be careful where you step!”<br /> <br />“Did you twist your ankle?”<br /> <br />(What’s this? I have to go to Lily first.)<br /> <br />Although it was a type of pain he had never felt before, Saito quickly headed towards Lily, but his foot slipped when he tried to stand up.<br /> <br />“Ah!”<br /> <br />In the tilting world, he caught sight of wet leaves on the spot he had stepped on earlier.<br /> <br />“Ugh!?”<br /> <br />That was the root of all evil. Unforgivable. With that thought, Saito kissed the ground.<br /> <br />As a review of the kiss, let’s just say sand got into his mouth, and it was awful.<br /> <br />“Saito!?”<br /> <br />“Wow, a magnificent fall. Saito, is your nose okay?”<br /> <br />“Pff, pff! My nose hurts like hell, but probably no major injuries.”<br /> <br />Having fallen on his face, his nose hurt quite a bit, but it didn’t feel like it was broken. There didn’t seem to be any significant injuries.</p>

<p>As if to reassure the worried team members, Saito waved his hands lightly and then stood up.<br /> <br />“Ugh, the worst. My jersey is all dirty.”<br /> <br />“Don’t worry about it.”<br /> <br />As Saito looked around his body, the ground was muddy due to the slight wetness, and he was completely covered in mud.<br /> <br />He let out a heavy sigh.<br /> <br />“Saito, are you okay?”<br /> <br />Looking up, in front of him was a childhood friend extending her hand with a worried expression.<br /> <br />“I’m fine, I’m fine. Other than a hurting nose, it’s nothing serious. By the way, are you okay over there?”<br /> <br />“Yeah… thanks to Nishizono-kun, I’m perfectly fine.”<br /> <br />Saito, whose hands are dirty because he touched the ground when he stood up, stands up without any help from Lily.<br /> <br />When Saito looked at her worriedly, she told him that she was okay while looking a bit dissatisfied.<br /> <br />“Good then. …Hey, it’s more of a coincidence that both of us fell, right? We’re childhood friends, so we don’t need to be this similar.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, that’s true.”<br /> <br />Saito laughed at Lily’s agreement. Both of them laughed as if it were an unfortunate day.<br /> <br />“Okay, so that’s how it is. Since both of us fell, you have to be careful on the mountain. Walk with caution~”<br /> <br />Saito, who confirmed that all the members of the group can move without any problems, uses his own fall as a pretext to warn the group members to be careful as a group leader.<br /> <br />“Roger.”<br /> <br />“Be careful.”<br /> <br />“Watch your step.”<br /> <br />“It’s more convincing when someone covered in mud says it.”<br /> <br />“True.”<br /> <br />“Why are you so proud? I don’t get it.”<br /> <br />“Well, don’t sweat the small stuff. Anyway, let’s head for the next riddle and depart!”<br /> <br />“Ooh!”<br /> <br />With responses coming from each member, Saito gave the signal to start the journey, and some members responded with cheers.<br /> <br />Then, the members of Team Five, each paying attention to their steps, solved the riddles, and successfully cleared the treasure hunt.<br /> <br />They managed to avoid the curry without ingredients for dinner.<br /> <br />By the way, the gathered keywords hinted at solving the mystery, but it turned out to be curry rice. I thought it could have been something a bit more creative, but that’s just my secret opinion.<br /> <br />“Sensei, if there’s still time, can I change into regular clothes? This is getting uncomfortable.”<br /> <br />“It would be better to change. Sure, go ahead. But please come back as soon as possible.”<br /> <br />“Got it.”<br /> <br />Returning earlier than planned, Saito asks if he can change into his jersey.<br /> <br />After seeing the state he’s in, Chiee readily agrees, and Saito is allowed to return to the dormitory by himself.<br /> <br />“I’ll be right back.”<br /> <br />“Take care, Saito.”<br /> <br />“See you.”<br /> <br />After informing his team members, Saito quickly returns to their room and changes into his jersey.<br /> <br />As he packs the jersey into a plastic bag, it’s not even 2:30 yet.<br /> <br />With plenty of time left, Saito decides to wash the dirty jersey.<br /> <br />“Hangers, hangers… Huh? What’s this picture?”<br /> <br />While searching for hangers to hang the jersey to dry, Saito discovers a photo falling out of someone’s bag.<br /> <br />Curious, he picks up the photo.<br /> <br />“This is a photo of Lily that I took when I joined the club. I did a good job on this one. …But why is it here? I don’t remember printing this photo.”<br /> <br />Without a doubt, it’s a photo Saito took when he joined the club.<br /> <br />Since it turned out well, he asked a senior to send the data to his phone, but he didn’t print it.<br /> <br />(Wait a minute. Maybe I made one printout for the day we review the photos. So, maybe Kai brought this? Could it be that he likes Lily? Oh no, this is bad. He’s definitely someone who didn’t want this to be noticed. What should I do?)<br /> <br />After activating his brain’s internal computer and deducing the possibilities, Saito realizes that Kai might have feelings for Lily.<br /> <br />Otherwise, there’s no explanation for why he brought a photo of her.<br /> <br />He never thought that his friend is in love with his childhood friend.<br /> <br />Saito had not noticed it at all since there was no sign of it in Kai usual behavior.<br /> <br />It’s an abnormal situation for sure since Kai hasn’t confided in Saito about this.<br /> <br />(…Let’s just pretend I didn’t see anything.)<br /> <br />After careful consideration, Saito decides to act as if he didn’t see anything and forget everything he saw.<br /> <br />He puts the photo back into Kai’s bag and takes the hanger from the drawer to go to the washroom, as planned,<br /> <br />He washes the jersey with soap and scrubbing it with no care.<br /> <br />“…Can I really do that? Pretend I didn’t see such big news? It’s impossible for me!”<br /> <br />However, that determination doesn’t last long, and Saito slams his hand on the washstand after washing the jersey.<br /> <br />Given the circumstances, no matter how much Saito tries to clear his mind, the image he saw earlier clings stubbornly and refuses to let go.<br /> <br />Returning like this would undoubtedly result in awkward behavior.<br /> <br />The thought of it is giving him a headache.<br /> <br />“Wait a minute. Maybe, just maybe, there’s a chance I misunderstood, and it might not be related at all?”<br /> <br />Upon closer reflection, Saito has only discovered that Kai has Lily’s photo.<br /> <br />He hasn’t heard from him directly about having feelings for her.<br /> <br />While he believes Kai does, there’s still another possibility.<br /> <br />“Yeah, that’s right. Now that I think about it, it’s unlikely to develop feelings in such a short time since entering school.”<br /> <br />Convincing himself and repeating those thoughts, Saito returns to the balcony after hanging the washed jersey.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>



<p>Three hours later.<br /> <br />(That guy Kai, he’s taking a lot of pictures of Lily! This is definitely confirmed!)<br /> <br />Saito’s hopes are quickly shattered.<br /> <br />As a member of the photography club, Kai is obligated to take class photos.<br /> <br />However, he clearly takes more photos of Lily than necessary.<br /> <br />Even now, he’s taking distant shots of Lily cutting vegetables for curry along with Shuri.<br /> <br />This solidifies Saito’s belief that Kai has feelings for Lily.<br /> <br />“Wow, seriously?<br /> <br />Confirming that Kai has feelings for Lily, Saito is faced with the reality that his assumptions were correct, leaving him troubled about what to do.<br /> <br />“It’s fine if you want to feel down on your own, but light the fire before Nishizono finishes preparing the pot of rice.”<br /> <br />“I’m doing it. Wait a moment. I’ll get it ready soon.”<br /> <br />However, the world seems to not give Saito the time to think.<br /> <br />When he returns with firewood, Minaka urges him to light the fire.<br /> <br />Reluctantly, Saito gets up, picks up some cedar leaves and twigs lying around,<br /> <br />He stacks them in pairs, puts some of the collected twigs and cedar leaves inside, and uses the chakaman they were given to start the fire.<br /> <br />The cedar leaves, which contain a large amount of oil, burn first, and some twigs catch fire.<br /> <br />Then, before the fire could go out until it lit the firewood, a splendid flame rose in less than two minutes as cedar leaves were continuously thrown in to keep the fire alive.<br /> <br />“You’re quite adept at this.”<br /> <br />“Well, I’ve been taken camping since I was little. Handling this is a breeze. If someone told me to start a fire with a bow drill, that’d be a different story.”<br /> <br />As Saito manipulated the firewood to ensure an even fire, Minaka, who was sitting next to him with a dissatisfied look, complimented him.<br /> <br />“Aren’t you a bit more impressed now?”<br /> <br />“Not really. If I have to say, you’ve just changed from an annoying idiot to a not-so-funny idiot.”<br /> <br />WSeeing Saito’s slight change in attitude, Minaka gives her a cold, disapproving look.<br /> <br />“Is that so? Fine, I’ll keep an eye on this. You go help Lily and the others.”<br /> <br />“If that’s the case, I’ll take you up on that offer. I’m going to play with the cute girls.”<br /> <br />Saito shrugs it off and issues instructions for other tasks.<br /> <br />With a smug look on her face, Minaka joins Lily and the others.<br /> <br />(Weirdo. But anyway, now it’s Kai’s turn. Does he really like Lily? The current distance makes it seem complicated. What’s he planning to do?)<br /> <br />With Minaka gone, Saito seriously contemplates the possibility of Kai and Lily dating.<br /> <br />In Saito’s assessment, at the current stage, the chances of them dating are almost nonexistent.<br /> <br />The main reason being that Lily still hasn’t spoken to Kai properly.<br /> <br />Having heard enough of her stories about being popular, Saito knows that to win over that childhood friend, proper steps need to be taken.<br /> <br />So, for now, they need to establish a relationship where they can talk. However, simply taking pictures from a distance won’t bridge the gap.<br /> <br />(Is Kai really determined? Come on, you can do it!)<br /> <br />Saito sends his friend encouragement, but his silent cheers fall on deaf ears as Kai is absorbed in taking photos.<br /> </p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />“Let’s dig in!”<br /> <br />“I-i-i-i-indeed! Let’s dig in!”<br /> <br />At Saito’s signal, other team members, including Lily, join in the chorus.<br /> <br />After that, looking down, the aroma of spiced curry rice wafts around as each member is presented with their portion.<br /> <br />Today’s dinner is mild curry rice that they made themselves.<br /> <br />Shuri and Haruki wanted spicy curry, but the rest of the members, especially Saito, who is sensitive to spiciness, protested. Eventually, they decided on a mild version.<br /> <br />First, scoop up a spoonful to make it half rice and half roux.<br /> <br />(Yeah, delicious. Sweet curry is still the easiest to eat.)<br /> <br />As a feedback, it’s delicious, just as expected.<br /> <br />Using store-bought roux is a given, but the moderate spiciness of sweet curry, without the sharp heat of regular curry, suits Lily’s palate the best.<br /> <br />“I didn’t notice since I’ve been eating spicy lately, but sweet curry is tasty too! Lily.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, that’s right. I like the slightly smoky aroma too; it feels like we cooked outdoors.”<br /> <br />Even Shuri, who usually prefers spicy, seems to enjoy it as he happily devours the curry.<br /> <br />Watching their content expressions, Lily smiles.<br /> <br />“I get it! It’s delicious with a different flavor than usual. By the way, I prefer the rice a bit firmer, but if everyone is eating it, this is fine.”<br /> <br />“I actually prefer it a bit firmer too.”<br /> <br />“Haha, sorry. I just cooked it with the usual amount of water without thinking.”<br /> <br />“Ah, no, sorry. I didn’t mean to blame you. It’s just that a bit firmer would be better, that’s all.”<br /> <br />The conversation shifts from curry roux to rice.<br /> <br />Saito and Haruki, discussing the situation, were interrupted by an apologetic Haruki.<br /> <br />Seeing that he had no intention of blaming him, Shuri quickly reassured the dejected Haruki.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Lily, having shifted her gaze away from them, looked at her childhood friend, who was sitting on the opposite side.<br /> <br />“Kai, is it really okay for you not to sit next to me?”<br /> <br />“Huh? It doesn’t matter where I sit.”<br /> <br />“O-Okay.”<br /> <br />Saito discussed seating arrangements with his friend Kai.<br /> <br />It seemed like there was a desire to switch seats, but Kai didn’t seem to notice and declined, leaving Haruki feeling down.<br /> <br />(What does he want to do?)</p>







<p><br /> <br />Even with their long history, Lily couldn’t understand the meaning behind his actions and tilted her head.<br /> <br />After that, Saito’s behavior became a bit strange.<br /> <br />He suddenly complained of stomach pain, taking Haruki with him to the restroom. He even offered to take care of the dishes, saying his skin would get rough if the girls did them.<br /> <br />As for Lily, it was a great help for Saito to do the dishes, When he finished washing the dishes and pots, he was holding his head in despair, a real mystery.<br /> <br />(Today, Saito is acting really weird.)<br /> <br />Never having witnessed such bizarre behavior before, Lily’s thoughts were consumed by Saito.<br /> <br />This did not change while Lily was taking her favorite bath.<br /> <br />“Li~lichi~!”<br /> <br />“Hyaah! Wait, Shuri-chan!?”<br /> <br />Lost in her thoughts, Lily didn’t notice her approaching friend from behind.<br /> <br />Suddenly, someone approached from behind, squeezing her ample chest, and Lily screamed in surprise.<br /> <br />“Oh, just as expected. It’s irresistible. Your soft skin clings to my hands, it feels so good.”<br /> <br />“Wait, stop! No, nooo!?”<br /> <br />Making crude remarks like a middle-aged man, Shuri continued to fondle Lily’s chest.<br /> <br />Lily tried to squirm away, but her body wouldn’t cooperate because of the strange touches.<br /> <br />“Where’s the problem? Tell me, Nee-san.”<br /> <br />“Hey! Shuri-chan, what are you doing!?”<br /> <br />“Nn, ah, Minaka-chan, help!”<br /> <br />Struggling to escape, Lily was relieved when her other friend, Minaka, appeared.<br /> <br />Surely, she would help. Minaka seemed like a serious person.<br /> <br />In Lily’s eyes, Minaka appeared as a goddess of salvation.<br /> <br />“Oh, Minacchi, look at this. I’m savoring the sweetness of Li-lichi’s watermelon. Isn’t it amazing? This JK’s assets are of just the right size. And they’re not sagging, but plump and bouncy. I’d give it 120 points, not just a perfect 100.”<br /> <br />Gulp<br /> <br />“Do not just gulping! Minaka-chan!? Help!”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry, Lily-chan. It’s not that I want to touch big breasts, you see. It’s an intellectual curiosity about how to maintain firmness with this size. Nothing more, nothing less. Yes, there’s absolutely no ulterior motive. It’s not because I want to touch my crush’s breasts or anything impure like that, okay?”<br /> <br />However, swayed by Shuri’s sweet words, the goddess fell without resistance.<br /> <br />Muttering excuses, Minaka approached, hands rubbing together.<br /> <br />“Wait, what are you saying, Minaka-chan!? Don’t come any closer. the eyes, it’s scary! Please, don’t come here~!”</p>

<p>Resisting desperately, Lily’s futile struggles echoed in the large bathhouse as the girl’s distressing screams resonated throughout.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>“Snik snik… I can never get married now.”<br /> <br />It was a while after Lily was released from their grasp.<br /> <br />Returning to the room, Lily had tears in the corners of her eyes as she sat in the corner, cross-legged.<br /> <br />“Oh, it was amazing, Li-lichi’s breasts. Totally different from mine, so I never got tired of it.”<br /> <br />In stark contrast, the face of one of the culprits, Shuri, gleamed with satisfaction.<br /> <br />She showed no remorse whatsoever.<br /> <br />“I’m sorry. I really went too far. To do such a thing to you, Lily-chan. If it comes to it, I’ll apologize by cutting my belly.”<br /> <br />“Heavy, heavy! You don’t have to go that far.”<br /> <br />On the other hand, the other culprit, Minaka, who had regained her sanity, seemed visibly down.<br /> <br />Without realizing it, a cutter knife from her pencil case was gripped in her hand, making a clicking sound.<br /> <br />Lily intervened when she heard the sound, fearing Minaka might actually cut her belly.<br /> <br />“Do you really forgive me?”<br /> <br />Her downcast eyes showed anxiety, afraid that Lily might dislike her.<br /> <br />“Well, I didn’t like having my chest touched, but that’s within the range of girls’ friendly physical contact. The talk about not being able to get married is just a joke. I don’t really think that seriously!”<br /> <br />“Lily-chan… I like you!”<br /> <br />“Whoa, don’t suddenly hug me!?”<br /> <br />Certainly, their physical contact was intense, touching various parts of Lily’s body, and she didn’t like it.<br /> <br />However, she had experienced similar things a few times in her first life, so she wasn’t about to get upset now.<br /> <br />Keeping the time loop a secret, she conveyed that she wasn’t angry. Overwhelmed by her feelings, Minaka hugged Lily.<br /> <br />The cool Minaka, unexpectedly, did something like that, leaving Lily flustered.<br /> <br />Seeing Minaka rubbing her cheek, Lily’s opinion of Minaka changed considerably.<br /> <br />Afterward, Lily and her friends discussed the events of the day at the outdoor school and engaged in some girlish talk about romance.<br /> <br />However, since they had recently entered high school, there was no information about who liked whom.<br /> <br />Although Lily knew who the girls in her class had crushes on due to the time loop, revealing that information would be too unnatural, so she kept it to herself.<br /> <br />The conversation then shifted to discussions about their middle school love lives, and most of the spotlight was taken by Shuri.<br /> <br />When asked about her relationship with Saito, Lily shared a somewhat embarrassing childhood episode, making it clear that she didn’t see him as a romantic interest.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s about time to sleep and prepare for tomorrow.”<br /> <br />When engrossed in something, time passes quickly. Glancing at the clock, Lily noticed it was past 10, the usual bedtime.<br /> <br />Although it was still early for her, today’s outdoor activities had accumulated more fatigue than she expected, making her eyelids heavy.<br /> <br />As the conversation naturally concluded, she suggested it was time to sleep.<br /> <br />“Let’s do that. Ahh, I’m so tired today. My eyelids are heavy because I don’t usually exercise.”<br /> <br />“Ehh, we still have a lot to talk about… Szzz”<br /> <br />Seemingly, the drowsiness wasn’t limited to Lily alone.<br /> <br />Minaka readily agreed to Lily’s proposal, and Shuri, who seemed to have more to say, gradually fell asleep in the middle of her sentences.<br /> <br />“You fell asleep at an incredible speed. Just like that kid from that certain robot cat anime.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, be careful not to catch a cold. Let’s go to sleep too?”<br /> <br />In awe of Shuri’s incredible speed of falling asleep, Minaka likened her to a character from an anime.<br /> <br />Finding the expression surprisingly accurate, Lily couldn’t help but burst into laughter.<br /> <br />“Yes, good night, Lily-chan.”<br /> <br />“Good night, Minaka-chan.”<br /> <br />Covering her friends with blankets, Lily turned off the room’s lights and lay down.<br /> <br />Closing her eyes, not as fast as Shuri but certainly not as slow as Minaka, both of them easily drifted into the world of dreams.<br /> </p>




<p> </p>







<p><br />Click.<br /> <br />In the sinking darkness, a mechanical shutter sound echoed.<br /> <br />Due to my mother being a photographer, this sound was familiar yet disliked by me.<br /> <br />Opening my eyes, I found myself standing in front of the train station Lily often used.<br /> <br />However, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and it seemed like rain was about to fall.<br /> <br />(I need to go back.)<br /> <br />Nevertheless, with that vague thought, I turned away from the station and started walking towards my home.<br /> <br />Click.<br /> <br />As I passed the intersection, I heard the shutter sound.<br /> <br />Turning my gaze towards the direction of the sound, but there was no one there.<br /> <br />Thinking it might be my imagination, I convinced myself and walked past the park. Then, I heard the shutter sound again, two times this time, from the direction of the park.<br /> <br />Reacting to the sound, I immediately looked to the side, but again, no one was visible.<br /> <br />Feeling an indescribable sense of discomfort, I continued walking past the park. This time, I heard the shutter sound three times from the opposite lane as I crossed the bridge.<br /> <br />The third time’s a charm, and this time, I turned my gaze to the side, but a truck passed right in front of me, blocking my view.<br /> <br />Once the truck was gone, unsurprisingly, there was no one there.<br /> <br />Click click click click.<br /> <br />After hearing it from behind, I turned around.<br /> <br />Still, no one.<br /> <br />Click click click click click.<br /> <br />From the left, I heard it five times, but there was no one there.<br /> <br />Click click click click click click.<br /> <br />Six times from the right, yet no one.<br /> <br />Click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click.<br /> <br />No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br /> <br />Repeated dozens of times, with the fear reaching its limit, I ran away from the spot.<br /> <br />Click click click click click click.<br /> <br />I didn’t care about the sound anymore.<br /> <br />I just wanted to run. Run. Run. Run. Run.<br /> <br />(Home!)<br /> <br />When it became difficult to breathe, and my run turned into wheezing, I finally saw my home.<br /> <br />In an instant, an indescribable sense of relief enveloped me.<br /> <br />Ignoring the incessant shutter sound, I rushed into the house and hastily locked the door.<br /> <br />The sound stopped, and relieved, I collapsed on the spot.<br /> <br />Now, everything was fine.<br /> <br />That’s what I thought, but at that moment, my vision distorted, and I found myself in a different place.<br /> <br />In front of me was the door of a certain apartment.<br /> <br />With a click, the sound of the unlocked door reached my ears, and as the door opened, a boy with naturally curly hair and darkened pupils, holding a camera, appeared.<br /> <br />“[More, let me take more of your sparkle?]”<br /> <br />As he muttered those words, the bundle of photos showing my reflection entwined around my legs, trying to pull me into the door.<br /> <br />[…No, stop. No─────Ahh~! Huuu, huuu!]<br /> <br />Just as Lily, overwhelmed by fear, was about to scream, she woke up from the dream, panting heavily.<br /> <br />Breathing heavily like during an asthma attack, it was suffocating.<br /> <br />The sweat from her entire body, the unpleasant kind, flowed out, making her feel nauseous.<br /> <br />For now, to focus on stabilizing her breathing, she concentrated on regulating her breath, taking about three minutes to stabilize.<br /> <br />(Worst. Oh, is anyone awake?)<br /> <br />“Soo, soo.”<br /> <br />“Spee. Ah… there… good, Lilycchi… Spee.”<br /> <br />Having calmed down, Lily was able to check her surroundings calmly. The room was still dark, indicating it was nighttime.<br /> <br />Which meant everyone was still asleep.<br /> <br />She checked the faces of her friends sleeping on either side of her to see if she had woken anyone up with her scream earlier, but they were both sleeping peacefully.<br /> <br />“…… Thank God.”<br /> <br />Realizing this, Lily sighed in relief, exhaling a breath she had been holding.<br /> <br />If she had unintentionally woken up her friends with her scream due to the nightmare, it would have been incredibly embarrassing.<br /> <br />For now, to avoid causing any more disturbances, Lily quietly left the room and exited the dormitory.<br /> <br />The outside is chilly, despite it being spring, and the clear air pierces the skin.<br /> <br />Enduring that, Lily sits on a bench beside a vending machine.<br /> <br />“What should I do, really?”<br /> <br />She’s contemplating the nightmare she just had, or rather, the stalking incident she experienced once, which was the trigger for it all.<br /> <br />It was a dream, so it was exaggerated a little, but it actually happened.<br /> <br />The nightmare began about a month into her high school life, on her way home, when she started hearing the sound of a shutter click, “pasha.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>


<p>At first, she thought someone was taking a photo with their smartphone and didn’t pay much attention.<br /> <br />However, as the shutter sound continued every day on her way home, and after a week, it started happening even after she got off the train.<br /> <br />It was then that Lily became convinced someone was taking pictures of her.<br /> <br />But, even when she turned towards the direction of the sound, she couldn’t find anyone.<br /> <br />She was being secretly photographed by an unknown entity.<br /> <br />Feeling the fear, but with no decisive evidence, Lily couldn’t involve the police.<br /> <br />She reluctantly tried to identify the stalker on her own but couldn’t catch a lead, and two weeks passed.<br /> <br />The shutter sound escalated, and it switched to continuous shooting.<br /> <br />It was genuinely terrifying. So, one day, while running to avoid being caught, someone grabbed Lily’s hand.<br /> <br />The person was Akashi Kai, a student from Class 3, where Lily used to be.<br /> <br />He was a boy who always sat alone in the corner of the room, and no one knew what he was thinking.<br /> <br />“Don’t run away. Let me capture more of your sparkle.”<br /> <br />His murky black eyes were as dark as the night, and just looking at them made one feel absorbed.<br /> <br />Instinctively feeling fear, Lily tried to escape, but he had an unexpectedly strong grip for a small boy.<br /> <br />When she attempted to shout, he covered her mouth with a handkerchief, making it impossible to call for help. As he tried to drag her home, her ex-boyfriend appeared, restrained Kai, and called the police, bringing an end to the incident.<br /> <br />According to her ex-boyfriend, he happened to be following her because she seemed strange, and he saw her about to be taken away.<br /> <br />It sends shivers down her spine to think what might have happened if he hadn’t been there.<br /> <br />That became one of Lily’s traumas.<br /> <br />Now, getting into the main topic,<br /> <br />But there’s more important part.<br /> <br />what troubles Lily is the fact that the person stalking and secretly photographing her became friends with her childhood friend.<br /> <br />At this point, many would wonder:<br /> <br />Why did she enroll in a high school with such a dangerous person in the first place?<br /> <br />The answer is simple: to overcome her trauma.<br /> <br />Immediately after the time leap, she focused solely on preventing and avoiding trauma.<br /> <br />However, with her encounter with Saito, she realized that she could never truly be happy if she continued to avoid and run away from her problems.<br /> <br />So, she enrolled in Seira High School, which had several traumatic memories.<br /> <br />She initially intended to catch the stalker, Kai, on her own.<br /> <br />But, fate had other plans, and instead of the dangerous criminal Kai, he ended up becoming friends with Saito.<br /> <br />This has become a thorn in Lily’s side.<br /> <br />With him being next to Saito, her chances to talk to her childhood friend decreased, and she always had to be on guard against potential stalking.<br /> <br />Now, catching Kai and handing him over to the police might seem like the obvious solution, but doing so would undoubtedly make her childhood friend sad.<br /> <br />He is someone who cares deeply about his friends.<br /> <br />She regrets not being able to do something back then.<br /> <br />She doesn’t want to experience that again.<br /> <br />However, if she doesn’t catch Kai, the stalking won’t stop.<br /> <br />The conflicting feelings of not wanting to make her childhood friend sad and wanting Kai, the boy who gave her trauma, to face appropriate consequences, leave Lily in a state of confusion.<br /> <br />Though the stalking hasn’t started yet, Lily has been troubled by this dilemma for a while now.<br /> <br />She had been thinking about it even before the nightmare but hasn’t come up with a good solution.<br /> <br />Staring at the sky, Lily, feeling annoyed by the overly sparkling stars, unknowingly glares at them.<br /> <br />At that moment, she hears the shutter sound, “pasha.”<br /> <br />Turning her gaze in that direction, all she sees is deep darkness.<br /> <br />However, there’s no doubt that she heard it.<br /> <br />In other words, Kai’s stalking has begun.<br /> <br />(If it’s come to this, I have no choice but to catch him.)<br /> <br />Deciding so, Lily stands up and starts walking towards the direction of the sound.<br /> <br />After a while, she hears a loud noise, as if someone has fallen. When she turns on the flashlight of her phone and points it there—<br /> <br />“You idiot! Don’t do such things while hiding from the person you like! If you want to take a picture, just ask the person directly, fool! What you’re doing is a serious crime, you know!?”<br /> <br />—there’s Saito, grabbing Kai’s collar, yelling at him.<br /> </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> <br />The eldest son was born into a very ordinary family, with a salaryman father and a housewife mother.<br /> <br />However, this boy was peculiar.<br /> <br />Mostly quiet, he would stare into space, and suddenly burst into happy laughter.<br /> <br />Later, as he learned to speak, it became apparent that the boy could see a radiance invisible to ordinary people.<br /> <br />Capturing it in photos led to professional-level pictures, and his parents praised him as a genius.<br /> <br />But his peers had a different reaction.<br /> <br />They found the boy’s unexplained comments about seeing “sparkles” strange and made fun of him, labeling him a monster.<br /> <br />Naturally, he had no friends.<br /> <br />It was tough and painful.<br /> <br />Yet, the boy never complained.<br /> <br />Because capturing that radiance in photos could make the unpleasant events of the day disappear.<br /> <br />If he could just take a photo, that was enough.<br /> <br />Eventually, as a primary school student, he reached a point where he neglected human interactions entirely.<br /> <br />Even if spoken to, or even if things were thrown at him, he remained unresponsive.<br /> <br />His already unchanging face froze completely, and he stopped moving.<br /> <br />By then, the bullying had stopped.<br /> <br />It was simple – without a reaction, it wasn’t fun.<br /> <br />Initially, there was some action, like glaring or contorting his face in anguish, but without even that, it felt like hitting a doll and became empty.<br /> <br />However, stopping the bullying now wouldn’t change anything.<br /> <br />He had already been fundamentally broken as a human.<br /> <br />Photographs are everything. That is the man called Kai Akashi.<br /> <br />The inevitability of him committing a crime became a matter of time.<br /> <br />Until he entered high school, he hadn’t committed a crime simply because his ability to see radiance didn’t work with humans.<br /> <br />Until then, it had only worked with animals and objects. But then, he encountered her.<br /> <br />A human who shone brilliantly, dazzlingly bright<br /> <br />– Machigane Lily.<br /> <br />She had an otherworldly beauty that competed for the top spot in the class’s popularity rankings.<br /> <br />However, her face was always frozen, much like the boy, and the radiance wasn’t visible at first glance.<br /> <br />But one day, as she cracked a smile, it became visible.<br /> <br />“Beautiful.”<br /> <br />A radiance brighter than anything he had seen before.<br /> <br />From that day on,<br /> <br />the boy started taking photos of Lily.<br /> <br />Obsessed, he followed her every day, capturing photos. Strangely, he was never satisfied.<br /> <br />Even though he couldn’t see any radiance in humans before, with each photo of her, she displayed different lights.<br /> <br />Gradually, the boy developed a desire to photograph Lily all day long and tried to confine her to his house.<br /> <br />The result was a failure.<br /> <br />Interference occurred, and he ended up getting caught by the police.<br /> <br />If only he had been a bit faster, he could have kidnapped her. That regret lingered, but it was too late once he was imprisoned.<br /> <br />(I want to take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos, take photos… Ah.)<br /> <br />After being imprisoned, the boy, who felt an incredible amount of stress from not being able to take photos, died when a blood vessel in his head burst due to stress.<br /> <br />This was the first life of Akashi Kai.<br /> <br />Lily was completely unaware of this, but like her, Kai’s life was irredeemable.<br /> <br />Even if a second life came, it was likely to remain unchanged.<br /> <br />However, on the day of the beautiful cherry blossom entrance ceremony, everything changed.<br /> <br />“Oops, sorry to surprise you. I want to check the class but forgot where to look. Do you remember where to check?”<br /> <br />A certain boy spoke to him.<br /> <br />It was Saito.<br /> <br />Normally, Kai would ignore anyone who spoke to him, but for some reason, he reacted that day. Not only did he guide Saito to the bulletin board’s location, but he even introduced himself.<br /> <br />This was a remarkable occurrence.<br /> <br />He never expected himself to do such a thing.<br /> <br />After Saito disappeared, Kai pondered why he had taken such actions, but there was no answer.<br /> <br />In any case, he thought they would never interact again. However, the morning after the entrance ceremony, Saito found Kai sitting at the corner of the classroom.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p>“Hey, we meet again.”<br /> <br />“Thanks for yesterday. You really saved me.”<br /> <br />“As a token of gratitude, I’ll offer you my CalorieMate. It’s special. …Huh? Don’t need it. Shut up and eat.”<br /> <br />“Haha, don’t say something interesting with such a deadpan expression. You’re amusing.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Saito was a mysterious boy.<br /> <br />Kai, who was usually unresponsive and considered boring, found him the only one who called him interesting.<br /> <br />It filled a part of his chest that should have been empty.<br /> <br />At that moment, Kai felt happiness.<br /> <br />From then on, Kai began to hang out with Saito.<br /> <br />Their conversations were filled with humor and childlike playfulness, and Saito effortlessly joined in with Kai’s laid-back stories.<br /> <br />It felt pleasant.<br /> <br />This was what having a friend meant, Kai understood.<br /> <br />Saito was an amazing person.<br /> <br />He is not only adjusted to him but also expanded the world of Kai that should have been small.<br /> <br />When Entering school, Kai noticed his friends section on the messaging app was initially zero, but before he knew it, it had increased to three with Shuri, Saito, and Haruki.<br /> <br />They, too, found the expressionless, doll-like Kai interesting, and Kai felt the emptiness in his chest filling up again.<br /> <br />(It’s fun.)<br /> <br />By this time, going to school had become enjoyable for Kai.<br /> <br />Talking about silly things with friends and occasionally playing at the arcade after school made his ordinary student life enjoyable.<br /> <br />So, carried away, Kai wanted to share his likes with Saito and invited him to join the photography club.<br /> <br />Little did he know that this decision would later become a factor that led him to the worst situation.<br /> <br />Saito, as anticipated by Kai, agreed to join the trial membership, praising the photos Kai took just like his parents did.<br /> <br />He wanted Saito to know the greatness of photography too.<br /> <br />Throughout the trial membership, that’s all Kai kept thinking about.<br /> <br />But towards the end of the trial,<br /> <br />when he saw the photos Saito took, everything changed.<br /> <br />The girl in his photos shone brighter than anything Kai had ever seen before.<br /> <br />Lily’s radiance captivated Kai in an instant, making him want to capture it as well.<br /> <br />From then on, Kai started taking photos of Lily whenever there was a chance, but always within the limits of common sense.<br /> <br />As a result of regaining his human-like qualities through interacting with Saito and others,<br /> <br />Kai decided to limit himself to taking photos only when given permission by the teacher or when specifically asked by Saito to capture moments with Lily.<br /> <br />He refrained from taking photos otherwise.<br /> <br />However, this self-imposed restriction proved to be ineffective.<br /> <br />In such a limited state, he realized he couldn’t capture Lily’s radiance as he did that day when Saito asked him to take photos.<br /> <br />(If that’s the case, I have no choice but to take photos at other times.)<br /> <br />With this conclusion, Kai attempted to take pictures of Lily, but due to her aversion to men, she wouldn’t even talk to him, making it impossible to obtain permission.<br /> <br />So, he decided to take photos without permission.<br /> <br />One night during the school trip, while looking at the photos he had taken of Lily, Kai happened to notice her leaving the dormitory.<br /> <br />Carrying his camera, he moved to the spot where she would look most beautiful and raised his camera to take the shot.<br /> <br />(In this moment, if you press the shutter, you will fall into an irreversible place.)<br /> <br />However, completely absorbed in taking photos, Kai doesn’t realize it. In the moment when he was about to press the shutter, when she’s sparkling and shining…<br /> <br />“What are you doing? You.”<br /> <br />Suddenly a chilling voice cut through the silence, a hand reached out from the side.<br /> <br />It felt as if his arm was pressed with cold iron, causing the lens to blur.<br /> <br />With a snap, the camera hit the ground.<br /> <br />Turning his gaze to the side, he saw Saito with an expression of anger he had never seen before.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />Silence hung between the two.<br /> <br />“Why the hell did you do this?”<br /> <br />“…I wanted to take a picture of Machigane-san.”<br /> <br />Questioned with a voice Kai had never heard before, he honestly confessed his reason, unable to withstand the overwhelming pressure.<br /> <br />In the next moment, Kai’s collar was grabbed, and he was forcefully pulled closer. Their heads collided with a jolt, causing Kai’s vision to waver.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />“You idiot! Don’t do such things while hiding from the person you like! If you want to take a picture, just ask the person directly, fool! What you’re doing is a serious crime, you know!?”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Ignoring the fact that their heads had collided, Saito shouted in anger.<br /> <br />In Kai’s distorted field of vision, he could faintly see tears in Saito’s eyes.<br /> <br />（Oh, I must have made a mistake.)<br /> <br />Kai realized that he had made a mistake by hurting his friend.<br /> </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> <br />Time rewound a little, right after dinner.<br /> <br />“Sigh, it’s no use. It’s not going well.”<br /> <br />After finishing cleaning up, Saito was in the western-style toilet, holding his head.<br /> <br />The reason was obvious—it was about Kai and Lily.<br /> <br />Since realizing that Kai had feelings for Lily, Saito had been trying to bring the two closer, but with no success.<br /> <br />Even when creating situations where they were alone together, Kai and Lily wouldn’t even attempt to have a conversation.<br /> <br />He understood to some extent, but Lily’s aversion to men was deeply ingrained, and she wouldn’t talk one-on-one.<br /> <br />But if Saito tried to mediate between them, Lily would probably find out.<br /> <br />His childhood friend is an esper.<br /> <br />If Saito did something thoughtless, she would read his thoughts.<br /> <br />So, what he did today was Kai’s best support.<br /> <br />It was impossible for Saito to do more than that.<br /> <br />“I can’t do it anymore. Do your best, Kai.”<br /> <br />In the empty toilet, Saito thought about his friend who was organizing photos in her bedroom.<br /> <br />However, despite praying for the two to get closer, there was no event today where he could be with the girls.<br /> <br />Without any particular plans, he took a bath, returned to his room, and idly passed the time.<br /> <br />Although it was a dull time, for Saito, it was great not to have to be unnecessarily considerate and to spend time peacefully.<br /> <br />“It’s about time to sleep.”<br /> <br />“Yeah.”<br /> <br />“Yawn~ Well then, I’ll turn off the lights. I’m at my limit too.”<br /> <br />As bedtime approached and with nothing else to do, the three of them went to bed without any fuss.<br /> <br />Due to the accumulated fatigue, the three friends, all peacefully drifted off to sleep.<br /> <br />After a few hours passed since they fell asleep, Saito, awakened by a rustling sound, sensed someone rummaging through a bag.<br /> <br />In the darkness, he looked around and noticed that Kai was leaving the room.<br /> <br />(Where is he going? That guy.)<br /> <br />Assuming it was probably just a trip to the bathroom, Saito, intrigued by his friend’s actions, decided to follow Kai outside the room.<br /> <br />However, contrary to his expectations,<br /> <br />Kai was nowhere to be seen even after he went to the bathroom.<br /> <br />(Could he be taking photos of the stars?)<br /> <br />Walking while pondering where Kai might have gone, Saito unexpectedly caught sight of a breathtaking night sky, filled with stars not commonly seen in the city.<br /> <br />If Kai, the photography enthusiast, wanted to capture this beautiful night sky, it wouldn’t be surprising. No, it was definitely something he would do.<br /> <br />With a strange conviction, Saito left the dormitory.<br /> <br />“Brr, it’s chilly.”<br /> <br />The outside of the dormitory turned out to be surprisingly cold, and Saito, shivering, searched for Kai.<br /> <br />“Oh, there he is. What are you trying to shoot, Kai…tsu!?”<br /> <br />As Saito’s eyes adapted to the night darkness, he quickly spotted his friend,<br /> <br />holding a camera and seemingly aiming to capture something.<br /> <br />While expecting it to be stars, Saito directed his gaze to the camera’s viewfinder, only to find Lily, her face illuminated by the starry sky, completely unaware of Kai’s presence.<br /> <br />At that moment, something snapped inside Saito.<br /> <br />Acting on instinct rather than rational thought, he grabbed Kai’s hand, attempting to stop him from taking the photo.<br /> <br />“What are you doing? You!”<br /> <br />Surprised at his own ability to produce such a scary voice, Saito confronted Kai with a question about his intentions.<br /> <br />What are you trying to do?<br /> <br />To Saito’s amazement, he managed to stop Kai, and with a click sound, the camera fell to the ground.<br /> <br />Saito locked eyes with Kai.<br /> <br />In the dim light, it was hard to see clearly, but somehow, Saito could sense Kai’s awkward expression.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />Silence hung between the two, and during that time, Kai’s expression remained unchanged. Suddenly, Saito’s mind cleared.<br /> <br />Only now did he fully comprehend the situation, and an uncontrollable anger overwhelmed him.<br /> <br />Suppressing the boiling emotions as best as he could, Saito, still holding onto Kai, questioned him once again.<br /> <br />“Why the hell did you do this?”<br /> <br />“…I wanted to take a picture of Machigane-san.”<br /> <br />Kai’s response was exactly what Saito expected.<br /> <br />However, deep down, he had hoped it was a mistake.<br /> <br />(I believed in you. Why would you do something like this, Kai!!)<br /> <br />The moment Saito realized what Kai intended to capture, the restraint he had maintained exploded.<br /> <br />Grabbing Kai’s collar with both hands and pulling him, Saito didn’t care about their heads colliding.<br /> <br />Their heads hit each other because they were pulled without any resistance, but Saito didn’t care.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>


<p>“You idiot! Don’t do such things while hiding from the person you like! If you want to take a picture, just ask the person directly, fool! What you’re doing is a serious crime, you know!?”<br /> <br />” …… “<br /> <br />Saito continued to berate Kai, forcefully pulling him,<br /> <br />but Kai remained unresponsive.<br /> <br />“Hey, respond! Do you get it!? You were trying to take creepy photos! Taking advantage of Lily not noticing! You were trying to capture it with this camera!”<br /> <br />Frustrated, Saito forcibly brings his face closer, locking eyes, and continues to reprimand once more.<br /> <br />“…I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />After a short pause, Kai finally moved his trembling lips and offered a belated apology.<br /> <br />However, Saito’s anger didn’t subside.<br /> <br />This wasn’t enough.<br /> <br />So, Saito began expressing everything he had been thinking, one by one, to Kai.<br /> <br />“I thought I could trust you, my friend, I thought I could entrust Lily to you.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />“I tried my best for both of you to get along. To make sure Lily doesn’t feel uncomfortable.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />“Yet, you guys hardly talk at all. Don’t mess around, seriously.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />“If you like her, be more proactive.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />“If you want to take pictures, tell her directly. She might be cold, but she’s kind. She would have forgiven you for various things.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />“Why, why, why, why, why!? …Why did you do this, Kai?”<br /> <br />After pouring out his feelings, Saito collapsed on the spot, looking up at Kai’s face while crying.<br /> <br />“I’m sorry. Saito.”<br /> <br />It was only then that Saito noticed that Kai was shedding tears.<br /> <br />Uncharacteristically, Kai, who usually had an emotionless expression, was now crying, his face contorted with genuine remorse, apologizing like a child.<br /> <br />Just that made Saito realize that Kai deeply regretted betraying the expectations of his friend.<br /> <br />But it was too late.<br /> <br />It was too late to take action after the fact.<br /> <br />What Kai did was an attempted serious crime.<br /> <br />It is wrong.<br /> <br />He needed to be taken to the appropriate authorities.<br /> <br />He will be judged in the proper place.<br /> <br />That’s normal. It’s obvious.<br /> <br />But, what would happen if you did that to Kai?<br /> <br />Probably, he wouldn’t be able to stay in school anymore.<br /> <br />Even though it was an attempt, a crime was about to be committed.<br /> <br />Surely, he would be treated like a ticking time bomb.<br /> <br />Feeling unwelcome, Kai would probably transfer to another high school.<br /> <br />Saito hate it.<br /> <br />He hate it so much.<br /> <br />Kai certainly made a mistake.<br /> <br />He did something wrong as a human being.<br /> <br />Kai tried to harm his precious childhood friend.<br /> <br />He’s the worst.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />But, even so, for Saito, Kai was an important friend.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />At first, he seemed blunt and difficult to understand. But, as they interacted, Saito gradually saw the goodness in Kai.<br /> <br />His way of speaking is unique and amusing. Surprisingly, he’s easy-going. Good at studying. Unpredictable. A fool who unknowingly drank soup left untouched for days. Bad at coin games. Good at rhythm games. Skilled at taking photos. Sees things that others can’t. Surprisingly energetic. Cares about his friends.<br /> <br />Saito likes Kai for having so many charms.<br /> <br />Again, they’ll do stupid things together. Again, they’ll get scolded by teachers together.<br /> <br />Saito wants to continue such high school life.<br /> <br />So, Saito, standing next to his childhood friend, tearfully begged for forgiveness.<br /> <br />“Lily, please. This guy is scum who tried to harm you. But still, he’s my precious friend. Can you please forgive him?”<br /> <br />And…<br /> <br />“…Fine. If you’re begging me with that face, I can’t help but forgive.”<br /> <br />Under the moonlight, Saito’s childhood friend smiled helplessly, almost like a goddess.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />(Unfair, really.)<br /> <br />Watching his childhood friend cry and break down, Lily thought that.<br /> <br />If he’s asking with such a terrible crying face, there’s no way she could refuse.<br /> <br />Because, if she doesn’t forgive, Saito might resent her.<br /> <br />Does he understand how painful that is for her?<br /> <br />(It’s really bad that he is unaware of it.)<br /> <br />No, it’s about her stupid childhood friend.<br /> <br />He’s probably doing it without realizing it.<br /> <br />Completely selfish.<br /> <br />No plans or calculations.<br /> <br />Just selfishness all the way, always painting a world Lily never thought of.<br /> <br />Because of Saito, Lily was helplessly drawn to him.<br /> <br />(Akashi-kun can make such a face. I didn’t know.)<br /> <br />Today, for the first time, Lily properly saw the face of the crying Kai, who was together with Saito.<br /> <br />“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />When their eyes met, he apologized repeatedly, like a broken machine.<br /> <br />Seems like he’s feeling a considerable amount of guilt.<br /> <br />In her first life, Lily didn’t know that a stalker who attacked her could have such a young face and cry like a child.<br /> <br />Back then, it was dark and murky, and Lily couldn’t understand, but surprisingly, his eyes were clear and beautiful.<br /> <br />Despite being an eerie loner without friends, he turned out to be a kind-hearted boy who could shed tears for his friends.<br /> <br />Lily didn’t know.<br /> <br />No, she didn’t want to know.<br /> <br />Because she had decided from the beginning that it was impossible and had rejected any dialogue.<br /> <br />If she had talked, maybe a better ending could have been drawn.</p>







<p><br /> <br />“Akashi-kun, I hate you. I really hate you. Peeping and such is unacceptable for a human being. I think only the worst people do that. But because Saito insisted, I’ll forgive you this time. If you do something similar again, I won’t hesitate to hand you over to the police. Be prepared.”<br /> <br />So, this is her punishment.<br /> <br />A reminder to herself that she was so caught up in the trauma that she didn’t try to find a better way.<br /> <br />Also, because Lily thought that the current Kai would never betray his friends like that again,<br /> <br />without any basis, she forgave him, and he responded with a crumpled smile, saying,<br /> <br />“Well, I don’t want someone like me to be jailed.”<br /> <br />That smile was like a curse lifted, incredibly bright.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The incident seemed to be resolved, and it seemed like everything was settling down. However, Lily’s ordeal was far from over.<br /> <br />“What are you doing! You guys! Shouting so loudly in the middle of the night is so rude!”<br /> <br />“Oh!”<br /> <br />“Oops.”<br /> <br />“…Uh, it’s not my business.”<br /> <br />“There’s no way that’s true. All three of you, sit properly.”<br /> <br />Saito’s angry voice and Kai’s apologies seemed to reach the dormitory, and their furious homeroom teacher, appeared before them.<br /> <br />There was no way to escape from this situation.<br /> <br />Forced to sit properly, the three of vaguely covered that Kai had been taking inappropriate photos. Instead they claimed that Kai and Saito were fighting because they disliked each other, and the teacher, furious at high school students behaving like this, scolded them severely.<br /> <br />Even Lily, who had done nothing wrong except being outside the dormitory, was scolded thoroughly.<br /> <br />“Haa, haa, please don’t do such things anymore. Do you understand?”<br /> <br />“Yeah. I’ll keep it in mind.”<br /> <br />“I won’t do it again.”<br /> <br />“I won’t go out without permission.”<br /> <br />Then the three were released around the time the sky began to lighten.<br /> <br />It was an hour before the students woke up.<br /> <br />Among the three, there was a common understanding that their homeroom teacher, Chiee, was dangerous when angered, and they were determined never to defy her again.<br /> <br />“Hey, wait? Machigane-san.”<br /> <br />“What is it? Akashi-kun.”<br /> <br />Just before returning to the dormitory, Lily, who had been suddenly stopped by Kai, stopped and turned around.<br /> <br />Truth be told, she hated talking with Kai.<br /> <br />But compared to when she first entered school, it had gotten much better, and now she felt she could tolerate a little conversation.<br /> <br />(What does he want?)<br /> <br />Thinking that, she turned her head, and Kai approached with an apologetic expression, speaking in a volume that only Lily could hear.<br /> <br />“…Is it okay if I take a picture when Saito and Machigane-san are together at school? Machigane-san looks sparkling and charming when she’s with someone she likes. I want to capture that if it’s allowed.”<br /> <br />“Huh!?”<br /> <br />Even after what happened earlier, Kai’s request seemed selfish, like that of Saito’s friend.<br /> <br />More than being surprised at how thick-skinned he was, Lily was bewildered as to how he found out.<br /> <br />“W-What are you talking about, Akashi-kun? I don’t like Saito like that. Well, as childhood friends, yes. But, anyway, it’s different, okay!?”<br /> <br />“…You don’t have to deny it so much. It’s obvious that you sparkle like crazy when you’re with Saito. I can see it clearly only when you’re with him.”<br /> <br />Lily desperately tried to brush it off as a misunderstanding, but Kai had reached a level where there was no escaping.<br /> <br />“Ugh… Am I really that easy to understand?”<br /> <br />“Maybe, I just happened to notice because my eyes are a bit special. Normal people probably wouldn’t notice.”<br /> <br />“I see.”<br /> <br />Reluctantly accepting it, Lily asked if it was so obvious on her face.<br /> <br />But she felt relieved when she heard that Kai was special, and normal people probably wouldn’t notice.<br /> <br />If she had accidentally revealed more than she intended while trying to cover up, it would have been too embarrassing.<br /> <br />(Photos of Saito and me…)<br /> <br />With a slightly calmer mind, Lily thought about the disadvantages and advantages of letting Kai take pictures of them.<br /> <br />First, the disadvantages.<br /> <br />She simply didn’t like being photographed by Kai.<br /> <br />She didn’t want others to find out that Kai is taking photos of her, especially Saito.<br /> <br />She didn’t like the idea of someone watching her interactions with Saito all the time.<br /> <br />Next, the advantages.<br /> <br />They would have many photos of Saito and Lily’s memories together. That’s it.<br /> <br />She listed the disadvantages and advantages that came to mind, but there was no clear advantage to accepting Kai’s offer.<br /> <br />However, the foolish maiden in love couldn’t help but think.<br /> <br />(…I want various photos of Saito.)<br /> <br />And so,<br /> <br />When the childish desire to see everything about someone you like, even the parts they don’t know, arose, it was already too late.<br /> <br />The balance within Lily had tilted to the opposite side.<br /> <br />” …You can take pictures as long as it’s only during school hours.”<br /> <br />“Really!? Thank you!”<br /> <br />With Lily’s conditional permission, Kai happily lit up with joy.<br /> <br />Although until recently, he had been desperate to make him stop taking pictures of her, now she found herself approving of him taking photos.<br /> <br />Today, Lily is clearly acting strange.<br /> <br />She’s an idiot. A complete idiot.<br /> <br />Normally, she would never allow such a thing.<br /> <br />She understands that in her mind.<br /> <br />But she doesn’t feel bad about it, probably because she’s been poisoned by her idiot childhood friend to an unbearable extent.<br /> <br />“Saito, you idiot!”<br /> <br />Lily, who didn’t want to admit this fact, hurls insults at Saito.<br /> <br />“What’s up all of a sudden!? Did I do something?”<br /> <br />“Just felt like saying it!”<br /> <br />With a mischievous smile, Lily suddenly insults her childhood friend, leaving him confused, and then rushes back to the dormitory where the girls are.<br /> <br />On the way, she hears a shutter sound, but she no longer finds it unpleasant.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On this day, the fate of Machigane Lily being attacked by Akashi Kai was partially whitewashed by Minazuki Saito.<br /> <br />But if it’s been whitewashed, then it can be rewritten anew.<br /> <br />To fill the born blank space, the world has written the name of another person there, but no one yet knows about this.</p>
