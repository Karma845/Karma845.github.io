<h1>Interlude 1: Overnight in a Student’s Room </h1>

<p class="calibre4">“Mmm~, I slept so well.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As if a switch was flipped, I instantly woke up with my eyes wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Usually, I have to set multiple alarms on my phone, dragging my consciousness out of a deep, muddy sleep and crawling out of bed like a zombie.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s been a while since I’ve slept this well. I feel lighter than usual, and my head is clear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When was the last time I woke up feeling this good?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be great if it could be like this every day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stretch in bed and reach for my phone to check the time, but it’s not by the pillow.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What, where is it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My phone is nowhere to be found.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This, the sheets feel different…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The feel of the body pillow I usually hug is different, and now that I think about it, the smell is different too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sit up and look around the room in a daze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a room that I know, but something feels off.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Was it always like this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As my vision becomes clearer, I realize what feels so different.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“!? This is Nishiki-kun’s room!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ve really done it now!!!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt the blood drain from my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How on earth did this happen?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, d-did I really do this!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">An inaudible scream of despair escapes me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Words like ‘overnight stay’, ‘misconduct with a minor’, and ‘disciplinary dismissal’ suddenly race through my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No way, wait a minute! I really slept over in my student’s room?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quickly check my own state.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s okay, I’m properly dressed. I’m wearing underwear too. Nothing looks disheveled. Still pure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a brief moment of relief, I hurriedly recall what happened last night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I went to his room, ate curry rice, cried, and was comforted while resting on his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Later, we talked while eating strawberries, and I must have fallen asleep at some point…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Remembering this makes my face burn with heat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“N-not only did I enter a man’s house, but I also spent the night here…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My carelessness plunges my previously bright mood into the ground.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, are you awake?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A voice comes from the floor.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“N-Nishiki-kun!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He sounds sleepy as he lifts himself off the floor.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“G-good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My agitation comes out in my voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Th-thanks to you…were you sleeping on the floor?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, because Sensei was deeply asleep in my bed. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nishiki-kun asks while holding back a yawn.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t remember at all…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel so awkward that I can’t even look at him properly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, Sensei. Could you please fix your clothes or hide them?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I check my appearance as he makes that request.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My clothes are really disheveled due to the earlier body check.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The top buttons of my shirt are undone, revealing my cleavage and bra, and my skirt is hiked up from checking my underwear, creating a rather revealing and sexy appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly wrapped myself in the duvet and backed away to the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just to be clear, I didn’t lay a finger on Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“B-but! Why am I sleeping in your bed?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I fidgeted under the duvet while straightening my clothes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, you moved there yourself, Sensei. You were leaning against the bed at first, but eventually, you crawled in and fell sound asleep. I tried calling out to you several times, but you didn’t wake up, so I gave up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He calmly explained what happened last night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Right, I often fall asleep leaning against my bed at home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Usually, I wake up briefly in the middle of the night and return to bed in a half-asleep state, so it’s not impossible for me to do something like this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But to think I would do such a thing in the room of a man who is also my student…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, you spent the whole night on the floor?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Would it have been better if I had slept beside you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He stood up, stretching his back and waist as if they were stiff.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m really, really sorry!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I bowed deeply on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m such an idiot───────!!</p>
<p class="calibre4">What would have happened if he hadn’t been such a gentleman?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If it gets out that you stayed in a male student’s room, it’ll be a huge scandal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way…I don’t want to be fired as a teacher.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I held my head in my hands.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I won’t spread it around.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">How many weaknesses of mine has he grasped up until this morning?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re not threatening me? You didn’t take any photos of me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel like crying again first thing in the morning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you doubt me, feel free to check my phone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…are you a god? I almost want to worship you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In a situation where I can no longer maintain even a shred of my dignity as a teacher, he remains calm, his demeanor unchanging.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What kind of upbringing leads to a high school sophomore being this composed?</p>
<p class="calibre4">My student is too mature.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what will you do? If you have time after this, I would like to continue where we left off yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I tilt my head, not understanding what he means.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t tell me that he would never attack someone in her sleep, but he would do it if she consented to it?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sensing danger, I try to get out of bed, but he stands in my way, blocking my path.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh no… I’m sure I won’t be able to escape if he comes any closer…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“….!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I swallow my breath as tension seizes my body.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Look! I’ve decided my first time would be with someone I love, so I can’t do such things lightly! Besides, I don’t have the adult techniques you might be expecting, so please give up!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In a flurry, I blurt out everything that comes to mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I feel like I might have said too much, but I was desperate to protect myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then it’s his turn to panic.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m talking about the discussion between the neighbors! Since Sensei fell asleep last night, we didn’t get to discuss anything!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He’s also in a rush to clear his name of any false accusations.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, yeah, I see…Of course, that’s what you meant. Thank goodness.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Finally, the tension drains from my body.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s jumping to conclusions, and then there’s this. Seriously, give me a break.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He looks genuinely troubled and averts his gaze from me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t apologize enough. But, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">All I can do is apologize.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Embarrassed by my own misunderstanding, I couldn’t even look him in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s more than just a blow to my dignity as a teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though nothing happened, an awkward silence fills the room bathed with morning sunlight.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since it’s a day off, how about we have breakfast first? Maybe this time we can have that talk.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He was the first to speak.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I’ll eat. Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I respond quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s always Nishiki-kun who makes these suggestions first.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His ability to sense and break through awkward situations is honestly reliable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, how about in an hour? Sensei, you probably need to get ready too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hearing his suggestion, I remember I hadn’t even showered before sleeping in his bed last night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh no, I start worrying about my own sweat and smell.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay! And I’ll do the laundry for the bed covers and everything!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’ll do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just leave it to me! It’s my apology for using your bed!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before Nishiki-kun can agree, I forcibly strip the sheets off the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“See you in an hour!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I rush out of his room while clutching the linens like a bandit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With that momentum, I return to my own room next door for the first time since last night, forgetting again about the bags of trash I left out in the hallway.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Whoa, wha-!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I trip spectacularly and end up burying my face in the pile of sheets I was carrying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a slight pain, I notice a scent that’s not my own.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ahh, ahhhhhhh────!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While letting out a strange cry, I quickly throw everything into the washing machine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, as if to wash away the traces of last night, I strip off the clothes and underwear I was wearing and turn on the switch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I step into the shower and let the hot water pour over me, I’m filled with intense self-loathing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What am I doing sleeping in his room?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nothing happened, but spending the night in a man’s room was a first in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve lived for twenty-three years without a single boyfriend. Never even been in a relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, I’ve never been involved in any adult relationships either.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve always had little interest in romance, viewing my friends’ obsessions with love and partners as something very distant to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though I’ve been confessed to since my student days, I’ve always rejected everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So much so that I’ve hardly ever been on a proper date, let alone stay over at a man’s place.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This is jumping ahead too fast.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And the person in question is a younger boy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi Nishiki. My student, who I coincidentally discovered lives next door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Maybe someone suitable is closer than you expect? Isn’t there someone nice at school?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">The words of my best friend suddenly resurface. That only makes me more conscious of him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Now the heat in my face isn’t just from the shower.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How am I supposed to face him after this!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m not sure if I can act like an adult in front of him anymore…</p>
