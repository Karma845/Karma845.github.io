<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.1</strong></p>

<p>Suddenly, A thought comes to me.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t like the word &#8220;loner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TN: ぼっち)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Loner&#8221; is the one who is always alone, without friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It stands for &#8220;lonely&#8221;. It&#8217;s quite easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I hate the word &#8220;loner&#8221;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before any misunderstandings, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I&#8217;m usually a bit lonely, but here, that’s not the reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason is&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This&#8230; &#8220;loner&#8221; is always used in a bad way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">i.e. &#8220;Botchi&#8221; is a bad word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sad, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to shout out my feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;huh? What&#8217;s that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, for calling you out to the gym all of a sudden&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s alright. So…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reflexively hid in the shadows.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I came across a “strange” scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A troublesome mess where a person is trying to say something important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve always liked you! Please go out with me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can you, like, just get it done with? And leave?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sigh as I keep myself concealed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;ll just go back to the story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not always bad to be alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s all your choice if you want to be with someone, or alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I like one person.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s all. Nothing more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, &#8220;Loner&#8221; is always bad-mouthed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s just being selective. There’s nothing bad about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I like to be alone, but I dislike the word &#8216;loner&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not definitely not saying that to find an excuse for this situation that I&#8217;ve fallen into because of my communication skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For God&#8217;s sake, I want you to believe me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I’ll have to refuse. Bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A direct hit.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A complete crush.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slavery of youth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, high school life is limited to being alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you try to find love, that’s what you’re gonna get.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you find love, then good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it&#8217;s over, you eventually break up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to go through it, a short-cut to life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The road ahead is full of thorns, and my shoulders are heavy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s really different this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?! Wait!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;There&#8217;s still something?&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can we at least be friends? I’m sure you’ll come to love me, just one chance!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really? Are you still tenacious?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I respect that passion, but I wonder if a persistent man will be even more hated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to give you that opportunity. So excuse me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey!&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no flag to raise. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the girl&#8217;s argument is clearly more reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really don&#8217;t think she’s interested in that boy.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confession is very one-sided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially when it comes to someone you don&#8217;t like, it&#8217;s just a push for favors and a compulsion to choose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you want to date the other person, or not?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Confession forces people to make that decision, even though they don&#8217;t have to think about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one should have that right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When love is the reason, everyone is unconcerned about bothering the other person as if they had justice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?! Why can’t we even be friends?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don&#8217;t feel the need.&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh!!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;No, it&#8217;s amusing, no matter how you look at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was completely rejected and turned it upside down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s absolutely hilarious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But hurting the girl&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s a lot to be said for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am not asking you out just because you are beautiful. I actually like you.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, please stop it, AHH, that hurts.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy was grabbing her arm quite hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Damn it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What bad luck!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;m going to give up on leaving secretly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped out of the hiding place and shouted in a loud voice that I rarely put out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Takeda-sensei! This way! Come quick!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The teacher?! Damn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let me just use the counselor&#8217;s name without permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TN: Actually, it&#8217;s “student guidance teacher”, but&#8230;yh…)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy who was confessing was surprisingly small and mature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He ran away in a very weird manner and turned to the corner and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let me think&#8230; Could there have been a better way?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was too late to change what had happened, and I couldn’t afford it either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was frustrated, but I didn’t want to get used to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Where&#8217;s Dr. Takeda?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I put my hand on my jaw, I heard a cold but clear, yet a little trembling, voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shoulder-length hair, that was rare among the girls, but the hairstyle was common.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the face…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was ridiculously beautiful with an overwhelming presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beautiful eyes, a tiny nose, and small lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An atmosphere which makes you feel relaxed, yet confident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You just need a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This beautiful girl might actually be the opposite of what we might think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I was fascinated by it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I’ll be back to myself soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignore what she said, and pass her without even taking a glance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t want it, neither do I expect it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like I said, if you try to ask for love, all you’ll get is pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today I just happened to be frustrated by that boy&#8217;s pestering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He wasted my time and blocked my path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why it’s over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing happens anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on, I&#8217;m going back to my normal life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Go home, eat, go to bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s fine with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s better this way.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, after the incident concerning the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gracefully dozed off during the second period of Japanese history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I woke up at the chime of the bell, stretching my body and streching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is always a hustle and bustle in the short 10 minutes of the break between classes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are those who just chat with their friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A guy in the corner was flirting with his girlfriend.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also have a friend who just came up and said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you sleep a while ago?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;sigh&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m kidding. Of course, I have no such friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My only friend now completely ignores me. I also have a club, where the guys usually chat and laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it happens, obviously, I&#8217;m completely isolated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that&#8217;s quite alright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the path I choose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A carefree and peaceful lifestyle.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t make friends, but rather I don&#8217;t try to make any.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to say that like I&#8217;m not lonely, but I actually am, so it can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;In the summer of starting high school, you can make friends without even thinking about making them.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told that, but really didn&#8217;t think it was so. So I just said, &#8220;You&#8217;re noisy, shut up.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;in my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My sleepy and narrow eyes vaguely looked throughout the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if I will fall asleep again.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I closed my eyes with that in mind, suddenly I heard a sharp voice in my ears that made me feel sleepy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba Ren, are you here? &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Kusuba Ren was now yawning and opening his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always alone, he sits alone in his seat and never talks to anyone. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus I was surprised to hear someone call me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the owner of that voice came, she came here and stopped in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As  she was coming here, I couldn&#8217;t move a step and only looked at her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was that beautiful girl from yesterday. It was definitely her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unlike that time when I was worried, I was being looked down upon as I was sitting. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was standing there with a dignified atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, she had an exceptionally beautiful face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ridiculously beautiful girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not only me, rather the whole class was captivated by this girl, and the classroom went quiet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;2-grade section E, Tachibana Rika. Thank you for your help yesterday. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TN: Junior year of high school, Japanese grades are named different</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rika Tachibana, the beautiful girl, said so while bowing her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you just come all the way to say yesterday&#8217;s thanks?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you looked up my class and name, which even I had probably forgotten.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what&#8217;s more? In such a way&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would like to give you something as thanks.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? No, no, no. I don&#8217;t need a thank you or gift, you can go back.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. I have to return the favor I received.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This conversation was being heard throughout the class.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A beautiful girl and such a mob to have such a relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If such a thing is known, my peaceful life will surely be shattered into pieces!</span></p

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something ridiculous just happened, for a beautiful girl to owe a favor to a loner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that happens, I have no choice but to convince her to go back before misunderstandings start to occur&#8230;!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said in a voice that could only reach Tachibana, such that even I could hardly hear it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am grateful for your thoughts but I don&#8217;t want to be involved with anyone. So please go to your class.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was you who first sold your favor voluntarily, so you should be responsible to receive the price.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, you do.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No&#8230; I won&#8217;t withdraw at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a difficult&#8230; or rather, a stubborn girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we continue to argue as it is, it will attract more and more attention from those around us.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first decision here is to let Tachibana return.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Okay. Fine. Then I&#8217;ll tell you about the price later. I have to ask you to go now. I don&#8217;t want to stand out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rika Tachibana didn&#8217;t say anything more, perhaps because the word &#8220;nuisance&#8221; worked.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She turned around and quickly walked out of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyes of the classmates who were following her turned at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unintentionally, I looked down upon my desk and avoided all eye contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn, It&#8217;s really getting bad&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can feel the curious  and jealous  eyes on  me, even though I can&#8217;t see their stares.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excuses and lies will only arouse interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school students like to spread rumors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if it starts to spread, the people spreading or listening never care about the feelings of the person involved, whether the rumor is true or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I definitely don&#8217;t want to be the target.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I completely misunderstood that beautiful girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather&#8230; that beautiful girl is unusual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I have predicted it from yesterday&#8217;s incident?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this was the case, I wouldn&#8217;t help people anymore&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While listening to the gossip of the class, I pretend to sleep until the chime of the bell signalled the beginning of 3rd period.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long day was  now over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sixth period had  finished and it was now  time to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students started leaving for home or club activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them were looking at me as well. Not to invite me to go home together or to join the club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather because of curiosity.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am a Bocchi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite easy to understand, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their interest and curiosity was about the relation between me and Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the morning incident, I crossed Tachibana in the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana said in a small voice, almost a whisper, &#8220;In your classroom after school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she understood my intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day didn&#8217;t seem that disturbing if you ignore the incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, back to the present.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretend to be in your thoughts and wait for people to leave.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few seconds after the last person left, Tachibana entered the classroom as if it was the most natural thing to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, she is really cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn&#8217;t matter now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My purpose right now is to break up my current relationship with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why I am not captivated by her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can only see her in that way a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I wasn&#8217;t thinking about your feelings.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First an apology?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well&#8230; she is not a bad person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine if you understand. Now, what about &#8220;returning the favor&#8221; you were talking about? .&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going straight to the point .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faster we get there, the faster we will leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was looking right at me, probably guessing what I was about to ask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not very captivating right now, but cute enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Make lunch for me tomorrow&#8221;</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Lunch?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, not a fancy one. Bread and milk will do. That&#8217;s the price for yesterday&#8217;s doing .&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;No. It&#8217;s still not enough. Request a little more.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No. If I request any more, the balance between lending and borrowing will be lost. We both want to finish the relationship between us as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I replied, Tachibana fidgeted a bit.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was way too cute, no matter how you look at it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning from the cold impression, this childishness.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This girl really is perfect.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Let me decide what to give you. I can&#8217;t just give you bread and milk.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh ? No&#8230; but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you disagree, choose more. I won&#8217;t accept it otherwise, and don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s troubling me.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Hmm?</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/6FwJLG0/195954.jpg"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found it quite surprising.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure that she would like to end her relationship with a mob-like me quickly.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, we are quite different?</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Well. Tachibana-san is right. So&#8230; how much?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I extend my right hand while saying that.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing my action, Tachibana just tilts her head, looking confused.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s just too cute&#8230;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m going crazy, just stop it, keep your cool.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What&#8217;s with the hand?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tachibana-san said to pay me back right? So, how much? Whatever will do.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am not giving in the form of money. It&#8217;s too dull.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then give me something you bought, I want to get over this.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I want. I want to give you a real treat.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn&#8230;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A beautiful girl who cares about the simplest things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll like what I bought for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I will definitely like what Tachibana-san would buy for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t trust you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;No.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all this beautiful girl is quite stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep arguing, you&#8217;ll just waste your time and energy.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, she&#8217;ll just get more and more stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Alright, tomorrow morning, I&#8217;ll receive directly from Tachibana-san right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Yes&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana said that with a very satisfying smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beautiful smile transcended any smile I&#8217;ve seen before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn&#8230; It&#8217;s dangerous for my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like I now understand the feelings of that boy yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can see such a face, any man&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, Kusuba-san. See you tomorrow. &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah&#8230; yes&#8230; see you tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, like in the morning, she walked out of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;See you tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words I unconsciously repeat make my heart flutter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as  a calm and collected person, I soon calmed myself down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had just replied as we had promised to meet together.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s just a greeting, no more, no less.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t expect much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations create disappointments and frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s just how I am.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At lunch tomorrow, I&#8217;ll receive food from Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is reality and what I expect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well&#8230;There is also something else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe I was lucky to see Tachibana&#8217;s smile.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.4</strong></p>


</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um&#8230; What is this?&#8221; I said during the lunch break on the next day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I had promised, I met Tachibana in the corridor in front of the classroom to receive lunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tachibana gave me a small box wrapped in a yellow cloth that didn&#8217;t look like anything I expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see it? It&#8217;s your lunch box.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t! Why did this happen? Our agreement was different.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I buy something Tachibana is satisfied with, and “receive” it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this has changed the agreement too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is getting worse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strange looks around me are making me very conscious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was stupid to trust her&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, get your face closer to Tachibana and enter quiet mode so others can&#8217;t hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked again, the answer was worse than expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I thought you were giving me a favor?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I said that I would decide what to treat, and I was responsible for the ingredients, so it&#8217;s the same as having a treat.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It will change&#8230; Shit.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I held my head in my hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument is becoming pointless because what she is saying is rather correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think about it, the cost of buying a packed lunch would be more. So&#8230; she was actually correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be less troublesome to receive it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But&#8230;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just why a bento&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You look very unhealthy, so I made some nutritious based food for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I would have been fine with the convenience store.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s ready-made, so it&#8217;s not good for your health. And&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tachibana said, she took out another thing, which was wrapped in a light green cloth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, It has the same shape as what I had received.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a really bad feeling about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get going.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whoa, Wait! What do you mean? I am not going anywhere.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana suddenly grabbed my arm and tugged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, this one is too troublesome&#8230;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you eat?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eat?! I would have! But why together?!&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Because I won&#8217;t be able to confirm if you ate properly.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same lines I heard yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana&#8217;s wide eyes say that she was not willing to give up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I have no intention of giving it up either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;if it&#8217;s just yesterday&#8217;s case, the rumors can be stopped and not taken seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now there must be a lot of misunderstandings. We must definitely avoid further discussion about this topic.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t like it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eating alone in the classroom wouldn&#8217;t be convenient for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, who grabbed my arm again, said something unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wouldn&#8217;t be convenient for me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did she say that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Speaking with you yesterday, I somehow knew how you are like . Based on your personality, I recommend eating with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out of the classroom together. That&#8217;s the best thing to do right now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I couldn&#8217;t argue with Tachibana&#8217;s words.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we went towards a place where the two of us won&#8217;t be seen by others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would give fewer misunderstandings to the people around me, and Tachibana could see me eating the bento.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was for each other&#8217;s benefit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what Tachibana said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was half-convinced, and the other half was just not giving up.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started walking faster to get my arm back from Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won&#8217;t let you drag me how you please.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But apparently, I noticed that I had unconsciously agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;you have an understanding of people&#8217;s feelings.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all my rebellion and sarcasm, I said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tachibana&#8217;s reply was surprising yet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; I can also understand your feelings.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.5</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s a blind spot. Over here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was brought to sit on the stairs leading to the roof.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, our high school roof is always closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, no one comes up here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be a common choice, but it&#8217;s fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sitting beside each other on the steps, we opened our boxes together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It looks pretty good,&#8221; I said.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meat, vegetables, eggs &amp; fish.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a very well-made bento with a perfect balance of colors and ingredients.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was definitely different from the convenience store bento.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven&#8217;t tasted it yet, but I feel it&#8217;s going to be good.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here.&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I received a stylish chopstick case which was crimson, and I clapped my hands.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Itadakimasu.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Itadakimasu.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Tamagoyaki- A Japanese dish made from egg.)</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Un&#8230; It&#8217;s delicious&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be called the most delicious tamagoyaki I&#8217;ve ever eaten.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well&#8230;really? Thank you for your praise.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that, Tachibana smiled faintly with a face that seemed to be satisfied.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cute and delicious.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chopsticks moved forward with no intention of stopping, and everything easily went into my stomach.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was probably the best lunch I&#8217;ve ever had.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; It was delicious. Gochisousama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Like Itadakimasu, but used after eating.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pack the lunch box and return it to Tachibana.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving it, Tachibana finished eating her own meal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thanks for that day,&#8221; she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No&#8230; it&#8217;s okay. I did it because I got annoyed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What he said, yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, I was able to talk naturally with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be due to the delicious rice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I felt like I didn&#8217;t care about the reason.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He should be happy that I heard him out,&#8221; she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…hmm.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I even refused, but still&#8230;&#8221; she said. &#8220;He had the guts to talk about why. Why did I reject him, and then even complain?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Mhm&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s really selfish,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I was…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I noticed Tachibana has a strange face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uh oh, I talked too much in vain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That seemed really rude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I find such stories annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uhhh&#8230; yes, I agree?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No. Sorry, I just started babbling and asked for a random explanation.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yeah. Well, I mean…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san, you are&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the chime of the bell sounded, which drowned Tachibana&#8217;s words.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that the chimes can be heard really loudly here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is it, the time I had been waiting for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I jumped up and looked towards Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bye,&#8221;I said, &#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went down the stairs leaving her with only 2 words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the sign of the ending.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship between me and Tachibana has now ended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shall not talk about it anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the path I choose. The &#8220;right&#8221; way in life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I didn&#8217;t even leave anything behind, nor did I listen to those lines that were drowned in the chimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;just like me,&#8221; finished Tachibana, but there was no one to hear her.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.6</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana Rika is obsessed with Kusuba Ren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These kinds of rumors vanished within a week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most major rumors last around 75 days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, around a week is basically negligible. This is because of my powers as a “mob”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a reason they got tired of the topic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because there was no addition to that rumor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana and I haven’t been in contact since the day we had lunch together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never talked or saw her with familiarity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I&#8217;m not good with it and do poorly, I may not even approach Tachibana within a radius of 3 meters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… It is to be expected that I have seen her a few times from afar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, beautiful girls tend to stand out, unlike someone like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, the relationship between me and Tachibana is completely normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, our paths of life had slightly overlapped but were now separate again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… Now that it’s over, we are back to normal.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is why it’s all over. So, stop talking about this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the classroom after school, I do not hide my feeling of annoyance and say so to the person sitting on the opposite seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he just gives a bright smile and say’s, “NOPE!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I expected those words but I still involuntarily sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You have a chance to get close to the “Takatsuki no Hana”?! This is a very rare, no, not only rare, this opportunity might never happen again!!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am not doing it again,&#8221; he said. “I don&#8217;t want to get any closer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“See you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My only “friend”, Natsume Kyoya came close to my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Kyoya is “きょや” in hiragana.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This skinship, aura, and overflowing energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact opposite of me, in every way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Anyway, why is she called “Takatsuki no Hana”?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmmm…? You don’t know that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya claps his hands as if he realized something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, he understands me. I’m sure if that’s good or bad though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tachibana Rika. She is cute, good at studies, and she is very famous in school. The delicate but dignified aura is super popular among boys who want to strike. But, maybe, because of that personality, she doesn’t have any male friends. That&#8217;s why she is called “Takatsuki no Hana”.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have no interest?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have any interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was more impressed with Kyoya, who somehow knew that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skills he has been as strong as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s a complete waste of this precious opportunity! Just try your best, what’s wrong with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Basically, I have no reason to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I say that, Kyoya can’t stop grinning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya is like a power charge of the world.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a big one at that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Handsome, good in sports, exceptional socializing abilities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, he has a lot of friends and is usually the center of class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A race that is different from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A human, but yet not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why am I friends with such a normie?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t look so surprised, I have known Kusuba Ren for more than 10 years. I know what you are thinking”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up, if you know, then read the mood.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, that’s what it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it simply, we have a long relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children from elementary school can become friends easily if they live close together or their parents are friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of the person is not that important.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Kyoya has been maintaining a relationship with me for a long time with the friendly nature of his possessions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Kyoya has been in touch for a long time now. After all, he is gifted with his friendly nature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s quite a big deal.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were, to be honest, I am grateful that he is my friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I can’t say I agree with his point of view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be able to do that,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t like to expect and regret, do you?&#8221; he continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. Discouragement and negative emotions come from expectations. If you quit from the beginning and don’t take any challenges, you can live peacefully.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But to hit a ball, you have to swing,” he tried to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That logic only works at the person on the batting line,&#8221; I replied. For someone like me, I am not even on the audience bench.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya opened his hands and shook his head.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… we do have a long relationship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I got accepted in this school thanks to you, and Tachibana is also in this school. Naturally, I want to repay the favor, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you really think so, leave the topic quietly, that’s the best repayment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, what about the examination?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have brought up another old story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya was not very good at studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, for me, that was like the only thing I was good at.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no energy to drive away Kyoya who came to visit my house to study.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And…That’s all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t expect anything in return.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think I’ll regret coming here, Tachibana is too cute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is the issue here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I could see through Kyoya’s eyes, I could see everything in an optimistic manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I already know what life is actually like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want any high hopes.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 16 years of experience, that is the conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyoya, are you there?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the classroom door opened, and a girl came in.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.7</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long beautiful black hair, clear round eyes, a cute nose, thin lips, tall and good posture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Posture as in style)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is different from Tachibana but still beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this guy…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Satsuki.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, there you are. I was going to the club.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Probs referring to the club, or that his GF is going to the club. Not referring to his GF)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, this beautiful girl is Kyoya’s girlfriend, Hinata Satsuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is nowhere inferior to Kyoya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya usually said &#8220;Thanks to Ren&#8221;, but I listened to Kyoya&#8217;s story for a moment and went back to the consultation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I hadn’t been there, Kyoya and Hinata would have never got together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: He means about how he helped Kyoya for exams in the previous chapter.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinata and Kyoya were really good together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By that, I mean their personalities, and their views on life are very similar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘In front of myself, I will do my best.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">also,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Do not be afraid to engage with other people.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And these ways of life must have been backed up by the confidence received from the experience of successful experiments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Kusuba is here as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whaa&#8230;? Still the same negative aura&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stunned expression.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a friend of Kyoya, my existence is accepted by Hinata.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though I am not her friend.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nzdj0K8/195955.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm… I think that a guy who talks to me, like Kyoya, is good. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would he otherwise?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is natural that the one who likes Kyoya can’t possibly be good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Not sure, but I think the author means to say like, “Talking advantage of the kind” or something.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinata turns to Kyoya and starts to chat away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not interested in their chat, but I still hear the loud voices.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How was today’s class? What happened with whom?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their relationship still seems to be well as Kyoya is patiently listening with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic slowly shifted to the club activities going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears that the flow of the conversation will stay that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… I should get going now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my thoughts, I suddenly look at the entrance of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked closely, two girls outside the classroom, who seemed to be waiting for Hinata, looked towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are those two Hinata’s friends?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought so, while the girl with shorter hair met my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Tachibana Rika.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to look away reflexively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I could not do it because Tachibana gave me a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did she nod?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While wondering, I raised my hand, and withdrew quickly, to make it look natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could sense the other girl outside grinning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to it, Kyoya also seemed to have noticed the interaction between Tachibana and me, and happily sent eye contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s uncomfortable, in a way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my gaze away from the window and kept silent until Kyoya and Hinata left the classroom.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Hinata’s friend was close with Tachibana, that is completely irrelevant to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just a coincidence…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think.</span></p>
