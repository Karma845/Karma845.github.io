<h2>Chapter 1: Shimizu-san and Joining the Club</h2>

<p>“Daiki, let’s start talking about love!”</p>

<p>One day, about a week after the commotion regarding Shimizu-san’s confession, I was on my way home from school as usual when Toshiya called out to me.</p>
<p>We hadn’t chatted about love recently, so I had thought he’d lost interest, but it seems I was mistaken.</p>

<p>“Don’t you have club activities today?”</p>
<p>“Today is an off day for the club, so I’m good!”</p>
<p>“Alright, then.”</p>

<p>I glance around the classroom just to make sure.</p>
<p>There are a few others left in the classroom, but it doesn’t look like anyone is interested in our conversation.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san, who sits next to me, seems to be napping with her head on her desk, so she probably won’t hear us.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Daiki! So I’ll announce today’s theme! Today’s topic is club activities you’d do with the person you like!”</p>

<p>I see, club activities with the one you like.</p>
<p>I’m not in any club, so this is a challenging theme for me.</p>
<p>However, it does remind me of something similar we discussed before.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you mention during a previous love talk that you’d like to be cheered on by your crush during a soccer match? Wouldn’t that also fit today’s theme?”</p>
<p>“Good point, that would be true if we’re talking about the soccer club. How about this time we discuss what it would be like if I joined the club Seto-san is in?”</p>
<p>“What club is Seto-san in?”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I haven’t told you. Seto-san is in…”</p>

<p>Before Toshiya can finish his sentence, the door at the back of the classroom bursts open.</p>

<p>“Kei, Daiki-kun, are you both here?”</p>

<p>The person who appeared was none other than Shimizu Ai-san, Shimizu-san’s older sister.</p>

<p>“Were you called here for some kind of appointment with Ai-san, Daiki?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>

<p>I shake my head several times.</p>
<p>I’ve run into Ai-san a few times in the hallways since the incident, but I don’t recall making any plans with her for today.</p>
<p>While I’m feeling confused, Ai-san has already approached my desk. Then she grins when our eyes meet.</p>

<p>“Okay, you’re both here. Daiki-kun, do you have some time now?”</p>
<p>“Hello, Ai-san. Sorry, I’m talking to Toshiya right now…”</p>

<p>Upon hearing my explanation, Ai-san shifts her gaze to Toshiya.</p>

<p>“Toshiya-kun… are you Toshiya Matsuoka-kun, Daiki-kun’s friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s me. You remember my name too!”</p>
<p>“Of course! I’m the vice president of the hyper-ultra student council, after all!”</p>
<p>“That has nothing to do with the vice president of the student council.”</p>

<p>An unexpected retort came from somewhere.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction of the voice, an exasperated Shimizu-san was staring at us. It seems she woke up due to the commotion.</p>

<p>“It seems Kei is awake too! Then, Kei, Daiki-kun, let’s go!”</p>
<p>“Where are we going? Besides, Hondō is in the middle of a conversation with Matsuoka.”</p>
<p>“Right! But, Toshiya-kun, is it okay for you to chat here?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you on library committee duty today?”</p>
<p>“Oh, shoot…”</p>

<p>Toshiya’s face rapidly turned pale.</p>
<p>It seems that what Ai-san said was true.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Daiki. I forgot I’m on library duty today! I have to go!”</p>
<p>“It’s good that you remember it now.”</p>
<p>“We’ll continue our conversation another time. And Ai-san, thank you for reminding me about the duty!”</p>

<p>Toshiya deeply bowed to Ai-san.</p>

<p>“No worries. She’s probably waiting for you, so you should hurry.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do that. See you tomorrow, Daiki.”</p>
<p>“See you, Toshiya.”</p>

<p>And with that, Toshiya hurriedly left the classroom.</p>

<p>“By the way, Ai-san, how did you know Toshiya had library committee duty today?”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, that’s a simple deduction, my dear assistant.”</p>
<p>“Since when did Hondō become your assistant? And why do you look so smug?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san quickly retorted to Ai-san’s statement.</p>

<p>“Your comebacks are sharp as ever today! Well, the truth is that one of today’s library committee members is an acquaintance of mine. I heard from them before that they were on duty today.”</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s why you knew.”</p>

<p>With that explanation, it made sense why she knew Toshiya had library duty.</p>

<p>“Did you get it? So, Daiki-kun, do you have some time now?”</p>
<p>“It should be fine as long as it’s not too late.”</p>

<p>I had plans to cook dinner when I got home, but I wasn’t in such a rush.</p>

<p>“It should be okay then because I don’t think it will take too long. Shall we go right away?”</p>
<p>“Hold on. Ask me about my plans too, and for goodness’ sake, tell us where we’re going.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Kei, you’re probably free, right? Anyway, the destination is a surprise!”</p>

<p>Saying that, Ai-san suddenly grabbed both my and Shimizu-san’s arms.</p>
<p>We were caught so off guard that we didn’t even have time to react.</p>

<p>“Now, allow me to escort the both of you~”</p>
<p>“Hey, let go! I’m not a child. At least let us carry our stuff.”</p>

<p>Ai-san released our arms.</p>
<p>It seems Shimizu-san’s words reached her.</p>

<p>“Right, you should bring your stuff. I got a bit too carried away.”</p>
<p>“What are you even planning to do…”</p>

<p>After that, Shimizu-san and I gathered our belongings, and we left the classroom with Ai-san.</p>

<p>“We’ve arrived!”</p>

<p>It must’ve been a few minutes after we left the classroom.</p>
<p>We were standing in front of a certain room’s door.</p>

<p>“Finally arrived. So, what are we doing?”</p>
<p>“We’ll let the person inside explain! Let’s open it!”</p>

<p>With that, Ai-san energetically opened the door. Following Ai-san, we cautiously entered.</p>
<p>In the room, two long desks were placed together in the center, surrounded by chairs, and a male student was sitting on one of the chairs.</p>

<p>“Yousuke, I’ve brought them both~”</p>
<p>“You’re here. I hope you brought them here with their consent…”</p>

<p>The bespectacled male student called Yousuke seems to be an acquaintance of Ai-san.</p>
<p>Looking at his face closely, he seemed somewhat familiar.</p>

<p>“Of course! Both of them willingly agreed!”</p>
<p>“You didn’t ask for my permission.”</p>
<p>“Kei, I know your inner voice agreed.”</p>
<p>“Do your ears only pick up what they want to hear…”</p>

<p>Both of them seem to be in high spirits today.</p>
<p>As I had that thought, Yousuke spoke up.</p>

<p>“Ai, Kei, calm down for a moment. If I indulge in your sibling comedy routine, the day will end. Let me introduce myself first so I can explain the situation.”</p>

<p>I was surprised by Yousuke’s statement.</p>
<p>Not many people at our school call Shimizu-san by her first name.</p>
<p>I think this is because many students are intimidated by her.</p>

<p>The fact that Yousuke casually calls Shimizu-san by her first name suggests he knows not only Ai-san but also Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>I wonder how Yousuke is connected to the Shimizu sisters?</p>

<p>“Right, Daiki-kun doesn’t know Yousuke. Go ahead, introduce yourself!”</p>
<p>“Yes, my name is Yousuke Sakata, a third-year student and the student council president. Also, I’m the troublesome Ai’s childhood friend. I know you might be confused about being brought here all of a sudden, but please take care of me (yoroshiku).”</p>

<p>I see, the reason I felt I’d seen Yousuke before was because he’s the student council president.</p>
<p>Moreover, being Ai-san’s childhood friend suggests he has some connection to Shimizu-san and likely knows her well.</p>
<p>It makes sense then that he would call Shimizu-san by her first name.</p>

<p>As soon as the introduction was over, Yousuke bowed deeply.</p>
<p>Surprised, I also bowed back in a hurry.</p>

<p>“Both of you, no need to be so formal. It’s not a blind date! Let’s be more relaxed!”</p>

<p>Upon hearing Ai-san’s words, both Yousuke and I lifted our heads.</p>

<p>“You’re too laid-back, though.”</p>
<p>“Flexibility is important, Kei. It reduces the risk of injury when you’re active.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the kind of flexibility I’m talking about.”</p>
<p>“We’re getting off track again. For now, all three of you, please sit in the available seats.”</p>
<p>“Right. Come on, both of you, sit down, sit down.”</p>

<p>After Ai-san took a seat next to Yousuke, Shimizu-san sat across from Ai-san, with a desk between them, and I sat across from Yousuke.</p>

<p>“So, where should we start… Hondō, what has Ai told you so far?”</p>
<p>“Um… I haven’t heard anything at all.”</p>

<p>Yousuke’s disapproving gaze is directed at Ai-san.</p>

<p>“I told you to give a brief explanation on the way here.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do better next time!”</p>
<p>“You keep saying that, but I don’t remember you ever making a difference… Well, whatever. Let’s start from the beginning then.”</p>

<p>Yousuke’s gaze shifts from Ai-san to me.</p>

<p>“Daiki-kun, where do you think we are?”</p>
<p>“Yes? …isn’t this an empty room?”</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised by the sudden question, but I decided to say what I was thinking.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d think so, but it’s a bit different. Kei, you know where we are, don’t you?”</p>

<p>With a slightly annoyed expression, Shimizu-san took a moment before replying.</p>

<p>“…It’s your club room.”</p>
<p>“Ding-ding! Correct! This is the Astronomy Enthusiast Club room of our school!”</p>
<p>“Astronomy Enthusiast Club? (天文同好会)”</p>

<p>I blurted out without thinking.</p>
<p>I didn’t know our school had such a club.</p>

<p>“It’s no surprise you don’t know. Our club is pretty low-key since there are only three members.”</p>
<p>“I mean, why is it an Astronomy Enthusiast Club, not an Astronomy Club?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san voiced the question that I had been pondering.</p>

<p>“We’ll explain that in detail later. I want to get to the main point first.”</p>
<p>“In the end, why were Hondō and I brought here?”</p>
<p>“It’s to recruit the two of you into the this Astronomy Enthusiast Club.”</p>
<p>“…why do you need to recruit Hondō and me?”</p>
<p>“There are two main reasons.”</p>

<p>Yousuke’s expression seemed to have turned a bit more serious than before. It’s as if a switch has been flipped.</p>

<p>“The first reason is to avoid the risk of disbanding the club. Currently, there are three members in the Astronomy Enthusiast Club including Ai and me. Ai and I are seniors, and we will have to leave the club once the second semester ends. The minimum number of members for the club is two, so if things remain as they are, the club will be disbanded when the second semester ends. At first, I thought it was inevitable…”</p>
<p>“I will never allow that to happen! As long as I’m still alive, I will not let it be disbanded!”</p>
<p>“…Ai has been like this for a long time. Well, I also have a sentimental attachment to this place, so I want to keep it alive if possible.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, what’s the second reason?”</p>
<p>“That is… because I want to do astronomical observations from the school rooftop!”</p>
<p>“Huh?” “What?”</p>

<p>Both Shimizu-san and I spoke simultaneously.</p>
<p>The topic seemed to have jumped too far, making it hard for us to understand.</p>

<p>“You’ve skipped too many details. We can understand from that explanation alone.”</p>
<p>“Really? In that case, Yousuke, can you explain properly?”</p>
<p>“I was planning to, even without you telling me….Well, the ultimate goal is to observe the stars from the school rooftop.”</p>
<p>“Just observe the stars however you like. What does that have to do with us joining here?”</p>

<p>I was also curious about that.</p>
<p>What’s the connection between observing the stars from the rooftop and needing more members for the Astronomy Enthusiast Club?</p>

<p>“I’ll explain it step by step. First, what do you think is needed to observe the stars from the rooftop?”</p>
<p>“What… A telescope and the key to the rooftop?”</p>
<p>“What do you think, Hondō-kun?”</p>
<p>“I also think we’d need the key to the rooftop.”</p>

<p>Indeed, I recall that the rooftop of our school was usually locked, and students generally couldn’t access it.</p>

<p>“That’s right, the key to the rooftop is essential, and to borrow the key, permission is required to use the rooftop.”</p>
<p>“If you know that, why not just get permission and observe the stars?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple. The rooftop is not authorized for use by individuals or hobby clubs.”</p>

<p>So it seems. Accessing our school’s rooftop is harder than I thought.</p>

<p>“Then maybe you might as well give up?”</p>
<p>“No, there is a way. While individual students or hobby clubs can’t get permission, if we become an official club, there’s a possibility. It might depend on having an adult supervisor, like a faculty advisor.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“We can’t do stargazing on the rooftop as an Astronomy Enthusiast Club, but if we become an official Astronomy Club, we might be able to.”</p>
<p>“Is there a way to change from a hobby club to an official club?”</p>
<p>“Yes, at our school, if there are more than five members and a faculty advisor, it can be recognized as an official club. Well, to be precise, there are other requirements like having a specific purpose and a place for activities.”</p>

<p>Listening to Yousuke’s explanation, I finally understood why we were being recruited.</p>

<p>“In other words, you need two more members to turn the Astronomy Enthusiast Club into an Astronomy Club, and that’s why you want us to join?”</p>
<p>“That’s pretty much it. We already have a potential faculty advisor, so the only issue is the lack of members. That’s why, for both the club’s survival and for stargazing on the rooftop, we really want you two to join.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for explaining, Yousuke! Do you both understand the reasons we’ve invited you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think I’ve mostly understood.”</p>
<p>“Same here.”</p>
<p>“Any questions? I’ll answer anything within my knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Can I ask one?”</p>

<p>If I’m joining the club, there’s one thing I need to know.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, ask away.”</p>
<p>“On weekdays, I can’t stay at school too late. Will that be okay?”</p>

<p>During the week, my parents often come home late from work, so I usually prepare dinner.</p>
<p>It’s fine if it’s just me at home, but I have a younger sister, Teruno.</p>
<p>I want to ensure dinner isn’t delayed too much for her sake.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. We don’t have a fixed activity time, and you can come and go as you please. Both Ai and I often have student council activities and aren’t always around, and another member sometimes misses due to committee work. In fact, the reason he’s not here today is because of committee duties.”</p>
<p>“I see… In that case, I think it won’t be a problem.”</p>

<p>If I don’t have to return home too late, there’s no particular reason to decline.</p>


<p>“Hey, are you deciding it just like that? We haven’t asked you the important stuff yet.”</p>
<p>“Important stuff?”</p>
<p>“What do you guys do here after school? You’re not always preparing for stargazing, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>Indeed, we hadn’t heard any details about their activities.</p>
<p>I assumed they studied something related to astronomy, but maybe it’s different?</p>

<p>“T-that’s…”</p>

<p>Yousuke seems flustered. Somehow, I’m getting the feeling their activities aren’t exactly what I’d imagined.</p>

<p>“Then let me answer that instead! The Astronomy Enthusiast Club is a place where you can casually chat and laugh about random things with your fellow members! It’s essentially a modern-day paradise!”</p>

<p>To sum it up, the Astronomy Enthusiast Club’s activity is…</p>

<p>“In other words, you’re basically using this place as a lounge and chatting aimlessly!”</p>
<p>“Well, you could see it that way, yes…”</p>

<p>The fact that Ai-san isn’t denying it seems to confirm that what Shimizu-san said about the club’s activities is accurate.</p>

<p>“Either way, I’m actually not interested in joining any club now. If we’re done talking, I’m leaving.”</p>

<p>As Shimizu-san stood up, Ai-san followed suit.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Kei! Just listen a bit more!”</p>
<p>“What is it? Convincing me is pointless.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t hear this out, Kei, I think you’ll regret it.”</p>
<p>“…That’s an unpleasant way to put it. Well, I’ll listen to you if you insist.”</p>
<p>“Good decision. Please, come this way.”</p>

<p>Ai-san said this while walking toward the door, then paused there.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you just say it here? Why do I have to move all the way over there?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with discussing it here, but I thought it might be inconvenient for Kei. Oh, if Kei prefers, I can say it here?”</p>

<p>Ai-san stood at the door, grinning mischievously as she stared at Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san glared back, though it didn’t seem to have any effect.</p>

<p>“If it’s not something significant, I won’t care.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. I promise it’s information that’ll benefit Kei.”</p>

<p>Hearing those words, Shimizu-san disappeared outside the room with Ai-san. Leaving just Yousuke and me inside.</p>
<p>As I wondered what to talk about, Yousuke spoke up first.</p>

<p>“Actually, there’s something I’ve wanted to say for a while now. Can I?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>

<p>Considering we just met today, what could he want to talk about?</p>
<p>Unable to imagine, I felt a bit nervous.</p>

<p>“Thank you for what you did for Kei.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Yousuke deeply bowed his head.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? I don’t remember doing anything deserving of thanks…”</p>

<p>Slowly lifting his head, Yousuke continued.</p>

<p>“No, you did. Do you remember when Kei was confessed to by that troublesome guy some time ago?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, when Ai-san came to the classroom before, she mentioned looking for Shimizu-san with a childhood friend.</p>
<p>That childhood friend must’ve been Yousuke.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t found Kei for us, I don’t know what might have happened. I hadn’t had the chance to thank you since then, but I always wanted to express my gratitude directly if we ever talked.”</p>
<p>“…I see. In that case, please let me thank you as well.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Thank me for what?”</p>

<p>Yousuke looked genuinely puzzled.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san is also someone precious to me. Thank you for helping me search for her during that lunch break.”</p>

<p>This time, I bowed my head in gratitude to Yousuke.</p>

<p>“Ah, raise your head, Hondō! I only helped out Ai! Besides, I see Kei like a younger sister. It’s only natural for me to be concerned.”</p>
<p>“You think of Shimizu-san like a younger sister?”</p>

<p>As I lifted my head, that question inadvertently slipped from my lips.</p>

<p>“Kei is my childhood friend too, you know. She’s always been like a rebellious little sister to me. That’s why I’m glad you’re by her side, Hondō.”</p>
<p>“All I do is talk to Shimizu-san, nothing more.”</p>
<p>“Just having a classmate nearby and someone she can casually talk to about anything might be precious to her.”</p>
<p>“I hope that’s the case…”</p>
<p>“Yes, so if you don’t mind, I hope you continue to be good friends with her.”</p>

<p>Yousuke’s gaze seemed to be filled with kindness.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Alright, that concludes the thank you’s. There’s something I wanted to ask you, Hondō…”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“You mentioned earlier that Shimizu-san is someone precious to you, does that mean… No, nevermind. Please forget I asked. If Ai or Kei finds out I asked you this, I have a feeling I’d get more than just a scolding.”</p>
<p>“Yes? Okay, I understand.”</p>

<p>I wonder what Yousuke wanted to ask.</p>
<p>He retracted his question so I won’t pry him any further.</p>

<p>“Regardless of the circumstances, just know that I’ll support you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you?”</p>

<p>I wonder what Yousuke is supporting for.</p>
<p>I can’t pinpoint it, but his support is reassuring.</p>
<p>Before I realized it, Yousuke’s gaze had shifted from me to the door.</p>

<p>“Speaking of which, Ai and Kei haven’t returned yet. Seems like convincing Kei is taking longer than expected.”</p>
<p>“It seems so.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“I forgot to ask earlier, but have you decided if you’ll join the Astronomy Enthusiast Club, Hondō?”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I hadn’t told him yet whether I’d join the club or not.</p>

<p>“Yes, if it’s okay for me to leave early sometimes, then it’s no problem. Plus, it seems fun, so I think I’ll join.”</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you! At least with this, the club will continue until the end of the second term. Whether it becomes an official astronomy club depends on Kei now.”</p>
<p>“It would be nice if Shimizu-san also joined.”</p>
<p>“If you mention it to Kei, she might just join… But for now, let’s wait a bit.”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>And so, Yousuke and I began to chat.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“So what’s the story?”</p>

<p>Standing in the hallway in front of the Astronomy Enthusiast Club’s room, Ai and I were alone.</p>
<p>With no one else around, it was unlikely that anyone would overhear us.</p>

<p>“Before that, why aren’t you joining the club? That’s not what we discussed!”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk as if we’ve been talking about this forever. This conversation started today.”</p>
<p>“Uh, well… yes, I know. But this is your chance!”</p>
<p>“A chance for what?”</p>
<p>“A chance to get closer to Daiki-kun! If you spend more time together in the same place, you’ll naturally become closer. And if you experience stargazing together, it will definitely strengthen your bond!”</p>

<p>Ai seemed to suggest that joining the club and participating in stargazing would benefit me.</p>

<p>“You just want to stargaze from the rooftop yourself, don’t you? And why the rooftop? Aren’t there other places where it’s easier to observe the stars?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, you got me. Though, what I said earlier wasn’t a lie. Recently, I got some information!”</p>
<p>“What information?”</p>
<p>“Apparently, if you stargaze from our school’s rooftop, your love will come true!”</p>
<p>“…Where did you get that ridiculous rumor from?”</p>

<p>I’ve never heard such a thing.</p>
<p>I usually only get this kind of information from Hondō, and he’s not one for gossip.</p>
<p>There might not be anyone less informed about rumors in this school than me.</p>


<p>“I usually keep my sources a secret, but I’ll disclose it this time! It’s a friend of a friend’s older sister!”</p>
<p>“You really trust that source? It’s basically almost a stranger to you.”</p>
<p>“I trust her. She seemed like a nice person when we talked.”</p>
<p>“You talked to her directly? Why would you even have a chance to talk to a friend of a friend’s older sister?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but be surprised, but given Ai’s nature, it wouldn’t be odd for her to find a way to strike up a conversation.</p>
<p>That’s what’s terrifying about her.</p>

<p>“Well, a lot of things happened. She told me that long ago, the astronomy club at our school stargazed from the rooftop. Nothing unusual happened at that time, but the peculiar part was what happened after. The members of the astronomy club found their loves one after the other after that stargazing event on the rooftop! And ever since then, this story has been passed down as a legend among the club members…”</p>
<p>“Given that you from the Astronomy Enthusiast Club didn’t know about it and only heard it from someone else, it means the legend wasn’t really passed down.”</p>
<p>“Come on, forget about the details! We can’t miss out on this legend! It’s a huge opportunity for Kei to find love too!”</p>
<p>“What big opportunity? This legend is probably just a coincidence. Seriously… I must be out of my mind to have taken you seriously.”</p>

<p>As I was about to head back to the Astronomy Club’s room to grab my things, Ai suddenly grabbed my shoulder.</p>

<p>“What is it? I’m heading home now.”</p>
<p>“Kei-san, have you forgotten why you came here?”</p>

<p>Why I came here?</p>
<p>She did mention there was something I would regret not hearing.</p>

<p>“You still have something to say? Even if you do, it won’t change my mind.”</p>
<p>“No, what I’m going to say will definitely change your mind by 360 degrees.”</p>
<p>“That means my mind wouldn’t change at all. You should say 180 degrees.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I wanted to say. Anyway, what I wanted to say concerns the third club member.”</p>

<p>True, Yousuke did mention earlier that there were three members, but there was little information about who that third member was.</p>

<p>“So, who’s this member?”</p>
<p>“This member is… believe it or not…!”</p>
<p>“Get to the point, else I’m leaving.”</p>

<p>It felt like a moment in a TV show right before a commercial break.</p>

<p>“The third member is… a second-year girl!”</p>
<p>“…So what?”</p>

<p>Why did Ai think that the third member being a girl would convince me to join?</p>

<p>“Eh, you still don’t get it after all I’ve said? Kei-san, it might be a problem if you don’t join the Astronomy Enthusiast Club now.”</p>
<p>“…what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I think Daiki-kun will join based on his reactions so far. And both Yousuke and I will sadly be leaving the club after this semester. You can guess what happens next, right, Kei?”</p>
<p>“…The Astronomy Club will be left with just that girl and Hondō?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Spending their after-school hours together, just the two of them, their emotional distance might get closer and closer until… Well, it’s not impossible, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>I can’t deny the possibility.</p>
<p>I don’t know much about this second-year girl, but it’s possible that with time, she could recognize his kindness and fall for Hondō.</p>

<p>“If you join the club, Kei, you can always keep an eye on them. Plus, you’ll get closer to Daiki-kun. It’s like killing two birds with one stone!”</p>
<p>“The only one benefiting from this ‘two birds with one stone’ situation by avoiding disbandment and being able to stargaze on the rooftop is you!”</p>
<p>“That’s one way of putting it. Then what will you do? Not joining the club?”</p>
<p>“Gunununu…”</p>

<p>Though it’s really annoying to be manipulated by Ai, who’s grinning like a little villain, I feel like I might gain more by joining the club.</p>

<p>“…I’ll join.”</p>
<p>“That expression on your face, Kei… Okay, let’s head to the clubroom.”</p>

<p>I decided to return to the Astronomy Club’s room with Ai.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>While chatting with Yousuke, the clubroom door opened, and when I looked towards the door, the Shimizu sisters entered.</p>
<p>It seems their conversation had ended.</p>

<p>“We’re back~. How did things go over there?”</p>
<p>“Over here, Hondō-kun has decided to join.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Thank you, Daiki-kun! I’m looking forward to working with you!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“How did things turn out for you?”</p>
<p>“Kei-san, please tell us!”</p>
<p>“…I’ve also decided to join the Astronomy Enthusiast Club.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s expression looked somewhat displeased for some reason. What did she discuss with Ai-san?</p>

<p>“With this, the new Astronomy Enthusiast Club, no, the birth of the Astronomy Club is upon us!”</p>
<p>“It will take a bit more time since we need to create various documents and obtain permission to be officially recognized as a club activity though.”</p>
<p>“We’ll work hard on that! And now, stargazing on the rooftop is becoming a reality!”</p>
<p>“I’m glad both of you decided to join. If you hadn’t, stargazing would’ve been impossible.”</p>

<p>I felt a bit puzzled by Yousuke-san’s comment.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you planning to invite anyone else?”</p>
<p>“Well… actually, there’s another member of the Astronomy Club who’s quite shy… And she was only okay with the two of you joining.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying she’s an acquaintance of ours?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I kept it a secret to surprise you, but I guess I can tell you her name now. Her name is…”</p>

<p>The sound of the door opening interrupted him, and I shifted my gaze towards it.</p>

<p>“Oh, speak of the devil. I thought you had a committee meeting today?”</p>
<p>“Matsuoka-kun said he’d take over my duties since he was coming late, so I came here early. Are these two your guests?”</p>
<p>“Actually, these two just decided to join. They’re the new members of the Astronomy Enthusiast Club. I think you know them, but let me introduce them again. This is Kei and Daiki-kun. And this is…”</p>

<p>Standing at the door was a short-haired girl we recognized.</p>

<p>“…Mio-chan! She’s our cool and cute junior!”</p>

<p>The girl called Mio-chan’s full name was Mio Seto.</p>
<p>She was also the love interest of Toshiya, a classmate of Shimizu-san and me.</p>
