<h2>Chapter 1: Makia and Thor </h2>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4>
<p>Maydare.</p>

<p>That was the name of this world that someone first shouted.</p>

<p> The great southern kingdom of Ruschia.</p>

<p>Even the heathlands of Deliafield, located at its eastern end, had a beautiful morning glow.</p>

<p>On this day, I, who had been studying magic since early morning, unusually neglected my magic book and was idly looking outside the window.</p>

<p>I dreamed of a strange world last night.</p>

<p>A dream about a spineless and boring girl who held herself back for her female friend and couldn&rsquo;t even confess to the boy she liked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a stupid girl. You should have given a love potion to the boy you like and steal him away from your rival. That&rsquo;s what I would have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was an &ldquo;unknown someone&rdquo; in the dream, but my deepest condolences to her. In the end, it was an abrupt bad end where everyone is killed by a mysterious man who appeared out of nowhere, and something about that really did feel like a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, are you awake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one who knocked on the door and poked their head in was a refined gentleman with wine-red hair and beard.</p>

<p>He was my father, Elliot O&rsquo;Drielle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is your eleventh birthday. I was just thinking of going to the market, but perhaps we can also buy a present together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course! It&rsquo;s like I rose early for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I jumped down from the protrusion by the window, stood in front of my mirror leaning against the wall, and started making preparations excitedly in that way.</p>

<p>My name is Makia O&rsquo;Drielle. Today I was an eleven-year-old small witch.</p>

<p>Around my almond-shaped eyes with the corners turned upwards, were framed by tight double eyelids and long eyelashes, preciously embracing our family&rsquo;s distinctive &ldquo;sea-colored&rdquo; eyes.</p>

<p>My long, rose-colored hair was decorated with a ribbon. Its luster rippled beautifully when it swayed, and Mother said it was like velvet.</p>

<p>I was a terribly beautiful girl, if I do say so myself, but I get a wrinkle between my eyebrows when I had a straight face, which made me look somewhat cheeky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nii&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was why when I smiled on purpose, it instantly became a nihilistic smile that looked devious.</p>

<p>When I raised the corners of my mouth with my fingers and forced a wide smile, my bright white and perfectly straight teeth just looked fake and scary. It was all due to brushing my teeth with Grandmother&rsquo;s special toothpaste every day.</p>

<p>Thanks to that, everyone said this.</p>

<p>With this, you&rsquo;ll be a villainous witch becoming of the O&rsquo;Drielle family in the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Okay. Preparations complete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put on a thin black robe over my dark red dress and checked the silver ring on the middle finger of my right hand.</p>

<p>And then, I flew out of my room and dashed down the spiral staircase of our mansion. My mother was at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, are you sure you haven&rsquo;t forgotten anything? If you get lost, call Freddy. If you get kidnapped because you&rsquo;re so cute, please pinch them with all of your strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother. I&rsquo;ll pinch them until they get a burn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother took out a cherry-colored lipstick from her breast pocket and applied it firmly to my small lips. This was my good luck charm when I headed out.</p>

<p>Then, she kissed my cheek and whispered into my ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, my dear. Do not be unreasonable with your father because it is your birthday. But, if there is something that you truly desire, firmly negotiate for it. An excellent witch is a woman who always gets what she wants. That&rsquo;s how I got your father as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aww, I want Father too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, Father is Mother&rsquo;s husband. But, this morning&rsquo;s card-reading tells me that Makia will find what she wants, so I&rsquo;m waiting eagerly to see what you will bring home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What I want, huh&#8230;</p>

<p>I got into the carriage, and as I looked out over the vast land that continued on endlessly, I wondered what that was.</p>

<p>This wild land was called &ldquo;Deliafield.&rdquo; The mansion with a pointed roof like a spear, standing alone in the middle of this land, was the residence of we, the O&rsquo;Drielle family.</p>

<p>The O&rsquo;Drielle family, the baron house that was entrusted with Deliafield, was a family of venerable magicians. I was the only daughter.</p>

<p>My father and mother are both a magician and a witch, respectively.</p>

<p>I would also enroll into a magic school when I turn sixteen, and after I graduate, I would work in the royal palace as a royal magician for a while. And then, I would eventually succeed my father and become a &ldquo;baroness.&rdquo; (TN: Kanji is literally &quot;witch baron&quot;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything you want, Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a new mandrake seedling, Father. Also, the finest dewdrops of daybreak and rainbow spider silk, and chocolates and caramels and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was swinging my legs and counting on my fingers the ingredients for the magic potions I had been practicing recently, as well as my favorite sweets. Father smiled perplexedly and tilted his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you those things even when it&rsquo;s not your birthday. You really do love magic, don&rsquo;t you, Makia. When I was your age, I hated studying magic&#8230; Did you wake up early this morning to study?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because magic is the best! The more I do it, the more I&rsquo;m able to do it. I definitely don&rsquo;t want to fail magic school either, so I&rsquo;m working hard starting now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha! Why are you worrying about exams now? With your talent, you will be able to pass on your first try without worrying about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm. I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wonder why. Since I was little, I had a strange anxiety about taking the exams for magic school.</p>

<p>The boring girl in my dream last night was also worried about the exams at some school.</p>

<p>Huh, maybe it was expressing my unconscious mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are gifted with a special talent. Our family is descended from the famous &lsquo;Scarlet Witch,&rsquo; but it seems that you, Makia, have strongly inherited the power of that witch, just as Grandmother judged. That is why it&rsquo;s fine for you to leave your studies sometimes and ask for what you really want. They say that witch got what she wanted no matter the cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I really want...Umm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I crossed my arms and wriggled my small body back and forth as I contemplated.</p>

<p>My father said this, but I was currently absorbed in magic, and I had enough dolls, dresses and shoes.</p>

<p>But, I actually did have one wish.</p>

<p>I had it for as long as I could remember. A strange longing of &ldquo;I want to meet someone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know where that person was, who were they, or why I wanted to meet them.</p>

<p>Far from living in the countryside, I lived in the middle of nowhere, and since I had no siblings, it might be that I just wanted a friend my age.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4>

<p>Now. The place Father and I arrived at was the port town Kartedt, which took three hours to reach by carriage.</p>

<p>Kartedt was outwardly a glamorous town, but when you entered the back alleys, you could find the black market that sold &ldquo;bad&rdquo; goods from all over the world. Father often came here to gather ingredients that were used for magic.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the type of place an eleven-year-old child would go to for her birthday, but it wasn&rsquo;t all that scary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Lord O&rsquo;Drielle. I&rsquo;ve obtained the item you were looking for. Come, this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that Father was buying something from the shop he patronized.</p>

<p>The shopowner beckoned Father to the back. Father told me to look around the shop.</p>

<p>It was a shop that sold curios from around the world. There were a lot of items with shady histories, and old books that whispered &ldquo;Open me, open me,&rdquo; but&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so noisy. If I open you, I&rsquo;ll just get dragged in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew. I must not open things like these.</p>

<p>And thus, I placed a heavy ornament on the book, then spotted a carriage through the window.</p>

<p>A boy dressed in ragged clothes was silently unloading cargo from the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That kid...is using magic without a ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I clung to the window in spite of myself. I wondered if he was a bit older than me&#8230;</p>

<p>It seemed like he stacked several wooden crates on top of each other and was lifting them up easily, but he was actually casting levitation magic on them. Just with his own intuition, no wands or incantations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Incredible. That&rsquo;s too incredible. Even though levitation magic is so hard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curious about that boy, I ran out of the shop.</p>

<p>Untidy and long black hair. A terribly thin body. And his eyes, which could be seen through his hair, was a striking &ldquo;violet&rdquo; color, and they held a mystical light.</p>

<p>It was an eye color that was considered to be of the highest rank in the world of magicians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey. What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I tried talking to him, the boy only gave me a side glance, then dropped his gaze again and worked hard at his job. He answered like he was annoyed.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You know what if you watch me. I&rsquo;m unloading cargo, young miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p> He sounded extremely sarcastic, but it didn&rsquo;t seem like he misheard me.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You were using magic to make the cargo float, right? I saw you do it earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p> The boy stopped his work and glared down at me.</p>

<p> His eyes, which could be seen through his long bangs, really were as beautiful as amethysts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look like one, but I&rsquo;m a witch. So, I thought your magic was fascinating.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Interesting&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Disgust filled the boy&rsquo;s eyes, and he snorted.</p>

<p> &ldquo;As expected of a rich noble lady, finding watching slave work fascinating. You&rsquo;re as wicked as you look.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Wha&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> I just thought I would sincerely praise him, though.</p>

<p> I felt miffed in spite of myself, and I crossed my arms and turned away.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll correct myself. I wanted to say that it was incredible. You&rsquo;re a genius for being able to use magic without wands or incantations or rings. Also, I&rsquo;m not wicked, I just look like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p> The boy resumed unloading the crates. I didn&rsquo;t know if he was listening to me or not.</p>

<p> Jangle...jangle...</p>

<p> There were metallic sounds coming from the boy&rsquo;s feet. His feet were restrained together with chains that were no longer than his stride.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey, those chains at your feet&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah. That&rsquo;s the mark of a slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p> When I carved a deep crease between my brows, the boy laughed out loud. It was a light laugh.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ahahaha. Is this your first time seeing a slave in chains, miss? Why would such a naive young lady come to a black market, I wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p> He unloaded the last crate and sat on it, then looked into my face with an adult-like expression.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Look here, miss. In this world, there are many kids who are sold as collateral for their parents&rsquo; debts, or kidnapped into slavery. I was born in the Frezier Empire in the west, and I was taken to this country after being sold by my parents. Well, I guess you don&rsquo;t understand stuff like that, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p> ...I do understand. Even I understand that&rsquo;s awful.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve heard that the slave trade was rampant in Kartedt, even though it was supposed to have been banned. I&rsquo;ve heard that adults from this country sometimes bought children from other countries in particular.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Your feet must hurt. They&rsquo;re awfully swollen.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Well, you know. I haven&rsquo;t taken them off in a long time. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before my feet rot away.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Then...I&rsquo;ll break those chains for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I knelt down on the spot and gripped the chains that bound the boy&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Myr vis makia...May these iron chains melt and fall away.&rdquo;</p>

<p> When I carefully recited the first and second incantations, my ring glowed faintly, and then the chain turned red-hot from the place I was gripping it and melted. This&#12304;Fire&#12305;attribute heat magic was my specialty, and its heat didn&rsquo;t transfer to anywhere other than the chains specified in the spell.</p>

<p>Even the aloof slave boy was surprised by this. His eyes widened at how only the chains cleanly melted away, and how there were no burns at all on his feet.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ll sprinkle the O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s special ice salt over this melted iron.</p>

<p> &ldquo;So? Magic&rsquo;s incredible, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Although I proudly looked up, the boy&rsquo;s face was hard.</p>

<p> Even though he had such a smart attitude earlier, now it looked he was afraid of something.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Boy! Are you done moving all the cargo?&rdquo;</p>

<p> I heard an angry voice, and the boy stood in front of me as though to protect me.</p>

<p> The person who finally came here was a burly man with a turban wrapped around his head.</p>

<p> He had a very pirate-like look to him, and he seemed to be this boy&rsquo;s master. He immediately noticed that the boy&rsquo;s shackles were removed. &ldquo;Aah!?&rdquo; he shouted in a rough voice.</p>

<p> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this!? Trying to escape, eh!&rdquo;</p>

<p> The man punched the boy&rsquo;s face with his big fist. The light boy slammed his body hard into the crate behind him and coughed violently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh-what are you doing! I&rsquo;m the one who melted that kid&rsquo;s chains!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I was scared, but I leapt out in front of the man with my arms spread out and glared up at him.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ah? Who&rsquo;s this squeaky annoying brat?&rdquo;</p>

<p> However, because the difference between our sizes were too great, I was grabbed by my lapels and lifted up into the air.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Aaaah, put me down, put me down!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ho ho. Still a brat, but a pretty little thing. Don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re from, but you&rsquo;ll sell for a high price.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Boss, that girl is a noble! You must not lay a hand on her!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Shut up, don&rsquo;t order me around! Like hell there&rsquo;d be a noble girl in a place like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p> This time, he kicked the boy who warned him and sent him flying.</p>

<p> The boy&rsquo;s face twisted in pain, and blood flowed from his head and the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p> At that moment, a crow swooped down from the sky with a &ldquo;Caw, caw&rdquo; and pecked at the man&rsquo;s head with its beak.</p>

<p> The man cried out and shook me to try to get rid of the crow. I&rsquo;m going to get sick&#8230;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Makia, are you outside? ...Oh?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Hearing the caws of the crow here, Father came out of the shop.</p>

<p> The crow perched on Father&rsquo;s shoulder. He was Father&rsquo;s familiar, Freddy.</p>

<p> Father saw me being lifted up by the man, and his face immediately turned scary.</p>

<p> &ldquo;T-T-The head of the O&rsquo;Drielle house!?&rdquo;</p>

<p> The man turned completely pale. He seemed to know Father.</p>

<p> I smiled gently, slowly stretched out my hand, and pinched the man&rsquo;s arm with all my strength.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Ow! What the hell is this shitty brat do...H-H-Hot!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I was blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;with a heat constitution. If I pinched something, it would get a burn without exception, and that burn would be quite hard to heal.</p>

<p> The man swung his arm that smelled slightly burnt and hurriedly let go of me. I nearly fell on my backside on the ground, but my body floated slightly right before that, and I was gently let down.</p>

<p> It was that slave boy&rsquo;s levitation magic. I knew because he was holding his hand up to me with a desperate look on his face.</p>

<p> &mdash;&mdash;Mmm. I&rsquo;ve decided.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Father! I want this kid!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I want this child no matter what, Father!&rdquo;</p>

<p> I ran up to Father and gave him a strong look of appeal. I was pointing at the slave boy.</p>

<p> As expected, even Father was surprised by this. Of course, the slave boy and the man who was his master were also surprised.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm. A slave, eh...Hmmm.&rdquo;</p>

<p> When Father finally began to worry, the turban man shook his head while pressing his arm.</p>

<p> &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take him, my lord, you can&rsquo;t! No matter how much you request him, he is the only one who I cannot let go! His eye color seems to be rare, so he already has a buyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p> However, Father ignored the man, swept up the slave boy&rsquo;s bangs, and peered into his eyes.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Violet-colored eyes, huh. A mystical color that indicates that the holder is likely to possess the most magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p> The slave boy said nothing.</p>

<p> Even when Father gripped his chin and drew his face to him, he stared back at him with no fear.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Father. This kid was using magic just now. Without a wand or ring or even a first incantation. I&rsquo;m sure he wasn&rsquo;t taught by anyone and doing it unconsciously. His talent is amazing!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I see. Makia&rsquo;s judgement might be correct. He&rsquo;s the possessor of exceptional magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Please, Father. I&rsquo;ll be working as a royal magician one day, so I&rsquo;ll pay you back. So, please buy this kid for my birthday!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;A ten year old intends to take out a loan from her parents? Ahahahahahahaha!&rdquo;</p>

<p> Father was holding his stomach as he burst into laughter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be eleven years old starting today,&rdquo; I corrected.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll ask you one thing. What exactly are you going to use this child for, Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible to say &lsquo;use&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ll have this kid use us.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I was just desperate. If I couldn&rsquo;t have him as a birthday present, I was going to beg him in every way possible, saying this and that.</p>

<p> &ldquo;First, we should take him in as a pupil. Producing a strong magician will lead to the restoration of the O&rsquo;Drielle family...Isn&rsquo;t that right, Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p> The O&rsquo;Drielle family was a noble family of magic with a lineage that stretched back five hundred years, but I knew that we were in a decline. If you leave the heathlands and go into the royal capital, they would say that we were ruined nobles or a clan of wicked witches, and despise us.</p>

<p> There were many reasons for the decline, but the lack of successors was more serious than anything else. For the restoration of our clan, we had to produce many outstanding magicians from our family.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; Father stroked his beard. He seemed to be considering my opinion from various angles.</p>

<p> &ldquo;I see. I yield, Makia. Well then, slaver, I wish to buy this child.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;I told you, sir, I cannot sell him! He already has a buyer!&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re buying him anyways. I want this kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p> I looked up at him firmly, and the turban man clicked his tongue, like this was bothersome.</p>

<p> However, little by little, the man&rsquo;s eyes became drowsy, and his expression became vacant.</p>

<p> &ldquo;So, how much?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Father backed me up.</p>

<p> The sea-blue eyes of us father and daughter might have been tinged with a little bit of magic.</p>

<p> The slave boy, who we bought at asking price, didn&rsquo;t let down his guard when he got into our carriage, and though it was probably unconscious, he was tingling with magical energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know who you are. You&rsquo;re the magicians of the O&rsquo;Drielle family. I heard you guys skin people raw, drain their blood, and use their eyeballs and bones as magical ingredients. Are you gonna use me for some kind of magic too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father and I looked at each other.</p>

<p>Unable to hold it in, Father burst into laughter, slapping his knee. He doesn&rsquo;t look like it, but he laughed easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahahaha! You&rsquo;re a very cautious child! Although, contrary people have a promising future in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father took his jewelled walking stick and quickly thrusted it at the former slave boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we are O&rsquo;Drielle magicians. That is precisely why my daughter Makia noticed that you are a possessor of exceptionally strong magic. You&rsquo;ve used that mysterious power several times before, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...That&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy shifted his eyes away. &ldquo;Because it was convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is unmistakably &lsquo;magic.&rsquo; You have a talent. Therefore, we want to nurture it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Nurture? Me, a slave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a slave anymore. You&rsquo;ll be learning magic with me. I&rsquo;ve always wanted a magician friend who&rsquo;s the same age as me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy looked like he still didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, I still haven&rsquo;t asked this boy something very important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have one. When I was sold by my parents, I threw it away at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t like he had forgotten it, but it seemed that he didn&rsquo;t plan on telling us the name he had thrown away once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see...hmm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment, even as I crossed my arms and twisted my body back and forth, I unconsciously used one of the&#12304;Ancient Magics&#12305;of this world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll give you a new name. Your name shall be &lsquo;Thor.&rsquo; I think it&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>That name came to me like a divine revelation.</p>

<p>The boy had a befuddled look on his face, but I thought his strong gaze was staring at me unwaveringly through his bangs.</p>

<h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4>

<p>When we returned to the Deliafield mansion, Mother came out to greet us along with her snake familiar.</p>

<p>And, she looked surprised in her own Mother way. &ldquo;My, my,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who exactly is this child? I have thought you would buy something no good, but I&rsquo;m shocked that you bought a boy of all things. Explain this situation, Elliot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bought him because Makia boasted that she would borrow money from me. His name is Thor. Makia named him as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, how amusing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d find it amusing, Julia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My parents started flirting with each other, so I took Thor&rsquo;s hand and led him to the bath.</p>

<p>In the bathroom, Damian, our servant, was cleaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Young Mistress Makia. Who exactly is this dirty child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a slave we bought on the black market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bought a slave?? This is a wicked deed that is befitting a witch of the O&rsquo;Drielle family. Are you planning to sacrifice him for something?&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not doing that. I think Father will probably make him a servant as well as pupil. Oh, give him a bath. I&rsquo;ll get his clothes ready and bring the salve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurriedly ran out of the bathroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Servant as well as pupil, eh. Hey, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Age?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably twelve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That kid was crabby and unsociable, but he properly said the name I gave him.</p>

<p>After the bath, he then got his hair cut by Mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, look, Makia. You&rsquo;re surprisingly weak for good looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t noticed because of this kid&rsquo;s unkempt hair and tattered clothes, but it seemed that he was a handsome boy with pleasant features. When his hair was cut short and evenly, I felt that his almond shaped, cool eyes with double eyelids resembled someone very much, but I couldn&rsquo;t remember who that was&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very thin, but if you eat properly and train, you will surely become a good-looking young man. Appearances are important for magicians. Being beautiful is magic in itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Haa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even Thor was being overwhelmed by Mother&rsquo;s somewhat captivating aura.</p>

<p>Yes, that was what magic was.</p>

<p>Mother was a bewitching beauty, but that very beauty was tinged with magical power, and she was able to have people at her mercy just by speaking or standing or walking.</p>

<p>Even after cutting Thor&rsquo;s hair, she cheerfully said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s treat him to a delicious evening meal,&rdquo; while leaving the room. Mother was the mistress of the house, but she liked cooking, and apparently she couldn&rsquo;t stand the free time if she didn&rsquo;t do it, so she stood in the kitchen herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor, I&rsquo;ll heal your wounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I brought with me the O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s special magic potion, the &ldquo;Ribito Salve.&rdquo; It was a soft ointment, and when I smeared it on his festering blue ankles that were chained, the wounds immediately healed.</p>

<p>The rest of his injuries were from being punched and kicked. He had cuts and bruises all over his body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you feel? It doesn&rsquo;t hurt anymore, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change your clothes too. We don&rsquo;t have boys here, so you&rsquo;ll have to wear Father&rsquo;s old childhood clothes, sorry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even so, just by tidying up his hair and putting on some decent clothes, it was hard to believe he was a slave boy just a short while ago, and his appearance even had an air of refinement.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because his appearance was put in order, and he had a mature air about him for a twelve-year-old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your idea of compassion, young miss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Thor looked at me in the mirror and laughed a scornful laugh filled with sarcasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You show compassion to me and tidy me up like this. You feel sure that I&rsquo;ll be happy because of that. I should say one or two words of thanks, yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think Thor wanted to say that it was my own egoism.</p>

<p>It was reasonable that he would think that. Ultimately, there was no changing the fact that I bought Thor from a slaver, and for Thor, his buyer just became someone else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that...I borrowed money from my parents to buy you. I won&rsquo;t deny that. But, it&rsquo;s because you have magical power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magic? Will you help if someone can use magic? There were plenty of slaves in that place. Those poor children who were much clumsier and got treated more horribly than me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But, you&rsquo;re the only one I was able to discover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This might be terribly unfair.</p>

<p>However, even if I lied, this kid could probably see through it. He wouldn&rsquo;t trust me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was only because you had magical powers that I could discover you. I knew with just one look. You aren&rsquo;t a kid who should be allowed to die as a slave in that place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, I said that name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, this is the world of &lsquo;Maydare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maydare. It was generally magicians who called this world by that name.</p>

<p>The first magician in this world named it so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Maydare?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the general name for this world. Apparently, the general public had already forgotten it, though. Maydare is a world where the great historical magicians of each country have moved the times, for better or for worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took out a children&rsquo;s storybook from the bookcase in the room, and had Thor sit on the sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the story of the &lsquo;Hero of Fraxinus&rsquo;?&rdquo; (TN: Fraxinus is the scientific name for ash trees)</p>

<p>Thor stayed silent for a while and stared at the cover of my book, but then finally shook his head.</p>

<p>However, there was a hint of interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five hundred years ago, there were three great magicians in this world. The first was the &lsquo;Black Demon King,&rsquo; the second was the &lsquo;White Sage,&rsquo; and the third was the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo; Their power struggle eventually created a war that engulfed the world. It was a big magical war from five hundred years ago. It&rsquo;s said to have boosted Maydare&rsquo;s magic techniques all at once&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The beasts of the snow kingdom</p>

<p>Their limbs broken and bound</p>

<p>Enslaved by the Black Demon King</p>

<p>The spirits of the lake</p>

<p>Tricked into a pot and boiled</p>

<p>Until they pledged allegiance to the White Sage</p>

<p>The beautiful maidens</p>

<p>Burned at the stake until they are ash</p>

<p>The Scarlet Witch&rsquo;s jealousy was as crimson as hellfire</p>

<p>Ah, how terrifying</p>

<p>The magicians beyond the door!</p>

<p>The first page began with that nursery rhyme.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a song every child in Ruschia knew, but it seemed that it was lost on Thor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the Hero of Fraxinus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the young man who stopped the rampage of the three magicians. With a golden sword in his hand, he was accompanied by his four comrades and defeated the three magicians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In children&rsquo;s stories, that process was portrayed in a very simple way in order for children to understand.</p>

<p>The Hero of Fraxinus first defeated his own teacher, the &ldquo;White Sage.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Next, he buried the &ldquo;Black Demon King,&rdquo; who built a nation with demons following him.</p>

<p>And finally, he was swallowed up in the self-destruction of the most villainous of them all, the Scarlet Witch, and died.</p>

<p>Thus, the world became peaceful with the hero&rsquo;s life as a foundation stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ancestor of us, the O&rsquo;Drielle house, is the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch,&rsquo; one of those three magicians. In that great war five hundred years ago, a huge hole was made in the center of Maydare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Scarlet Witch...I might have heard of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? She&rsquo;s the worst witch in the world. Thanks to that, she became a synonym for scaring children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Scarlet Witch,&rdquo; the ancestor of the O&rsquo;Drielle family, caused a huge explosion in the final battle which the &lsquo;Hero of Fraxinus&rsquo; got caught up in.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because we inherited that power, but the girls of the O&rsquo;Drielle family like me have a high possibility of being blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;. That was why I was easily able to use the heat magic that melted Thor&rsquo;s feet chains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this world, magical talent can be a force that moves the world, in a good and bad sense. If there&rsquo;s something you don&rsquo;t like, isn&rsquo;t it better to hone your magic, become a great magician, and change the world? Just like those three magicians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I closed the book with a thud.</p>

<p>I wonder if any great magician who went down in history accomplished something in the hope of changing this world.</p>

<p>Embracing their ideals, and chasing their dreams&#8230;</p>

<p>No matter what end they met and their name ended up getting passed down through history as that of a villain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...You&rsquo;re quite a strange one, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so? I&rsquo;m deeply serious, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letting out a giggle, I turned towards Thor again and placed my hand against my chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me introduce myself again. My name is Makia O&rsquo;Drielle. &#12304;Fire&#12305;magic is my strongest magic, and I love studying potions. Also, I have the special skill of being able to sleep anywhere. This wicked-looking face of mine is surely something I inherited from the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo; After all, I am the descendant of the world&rsquo;s worst witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even if I was the descendant of the most hated and despised witch in this world, I thought of that as something to be proud of. Therefore, I want to treasure what I have inherited from my ancestor and become a great witch like her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you get bound in chains again, then I&rsquo;ll melt them for you without fail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I extended my hand to &ldquo;Thor,&rdquo; who I named today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why, let&rsquo;s aim to become great magicians who can move Maydare together. I&rsquo;ve always been looking for that &lsquo;someone&rsquo; to uplift each other with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor stared at my hand for a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Haa. Understood, miss. I&rsquo;ll go along with you for the time being. It seems surprisingly interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Smiling his usual sarcastic-looking smile, he ended up taking my small hand.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ambition to use me to rise to a higher position in the world at least had lit up in his heart.</p>

<p>This world was Maydare, where magicians determined its fate even in the present day.</p>

<p>At that time, we had no way of knowing that the encounter between Thor and I would greatly influence Maydare&rsquo;s future history.</p>
