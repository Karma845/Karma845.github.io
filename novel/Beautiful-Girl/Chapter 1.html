<h2>Chapter 1: Entrance Ceremony</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p> <br />As the winter chill began to ease, and the sun rose a bit earlier in the spring,<br /> <br />Saito Minazuki, a tall boy clad in a tracksuit, was running along the riverbank.<br /> <br />“Hah, hah, hah, hah.”<br /> <br />With large strides, he extended his legs, maintaining a steady rhythm,<br /> <br />but today, he was running a bit faster than usual, swiftly navigating the familiar path.<br /> <br />“Oh, good morning, Saito-kun.”<br /> <br />“Good morning, Grandpa! You seem lively today too.”<br /> <br />Arriving at the turning point, he was greeted by a familiar old man.<br /> <br />Saito responded energetically, slowing down and transitioning into jogging in place.<br /> <br />“Hahaha, I can’t beat you, Saito-kun. You seem even more energetic than usual.”<br /> <br />“Oh, did you notice? Today’s my high school entrance ceremony.”<br /> <br />With even more enthusiasm than usual, Saito shared the news of his high school entrance ceremony with the old man.<br /> <br />“Oh, that’s wonderful. Congratulations on your entrance!”<br /> <br />“Thanks. I’m looking forward to it since it’s my first time commuting by train. It’s going to be so much fun.”<br /> <br />“I see, I see. Do your best.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I can’t be late for the entrance ceremony. Well then, I’m off. See you, Grandpa.”<br /> <br />With words of encouragement from the old man, Saito said his goodbyes and resumed his run.<br /> <br />(Well, but the most exciting thing is going to school with her.)<br /> <br />As the distance increased a bit, Saito’s lips curled into a faint smile.<br /> <br />In his mind was the image of his childhood friend.<br /> <br />They had been close for almost ten years, but due to the considerable distance between their homes, they attended different schools in elementary and middle school.<br /> <br />Now, with the opportunity of entering high school, they would finally attend the same school. There was no way they wouldn’t be excited.<br /> <br />when they both found out they had passed, Saito vividly remembered lifting her up, spinning her around, and celebrating their joy.<br /> <br />“All right! I need to get home quickly and get ready.”<br /> <br />He wanted to go to school with his childhood friend as soon as possible.<br /> <br />With that thought, his feet naturally carried him forward,<br /> <br />and before he knew it, he was running at almost full speed.<br /> <br />It was visible that there would be a tremendous backlash after this, but Saito, who was high, couldn’t stop his feet with his own will.<br /> <br />“Afternoon… huff… It was too fast.”<br /> <br />“Oh, Saito, you were early today.”<br /> <br />Returning home, Saito was completely exhausted, and as soon as he took off his shoes, he collapsed in the hallway.<br /> <br />Responding to the sound, his mother, Yabana, peeked out from the living room.<br /> <br />“Huff, huff. Ah, I’m tired.”<br /> <br />“It’s rare to see you, the stamina freak, like this.”<br /> <br />“Well… got a bit carried away.”<br /> <br />“I see. Well then, quickly go take a shower. You can’t meet Lily-chan smelling like sweat.”<br /> <br />It had been a while since Yabana had seen her son in exhausted mode.<br /> <br />Worried, she asked Saito for the reason, and his response was typical of him.<br /> <br />Yabana couldn’t help but show a wry smile and urged him to take a shower.<br /> <br />“Ugh…”<br /> <br />“Really, are you okay?”<br /> <br />She sighed as she watched him not showing any signs of moving, but Yabana went back to preparing breakfast.<br /> <br />“Yum… delicious! Mom, the dashimaki tamago today is as perfect as always.”<br /> <br />“Thank you… sigh, I guess he’s always been like this.”<br /> <br />A few minutes later.<br /> <br />Yabana realized that her worries were completely unfounded.<br /> <br />Saito, who returned from the shower, was back to his usual self, devouring breakfast with gusto.<br /> <br />Even if he caught a cold, he would quickly recover with a little rest. It was futile to worry about such minor things, and Yabana sighed.<br /> <br />“I think you’re okay, but just to confirm. What time is the meetup?”<br /> <br />“I think it was around 7:30 at that station. Let me check for a moment.”<br /> <br />Glancing at the rapidly disappearing mountain of rice, Yabana asked if he had enough time.<br /> <br />Saito thought he was fine, as they had confirmed it thoroughly last night, but he felt a bit uneasy and opened his smartphone.<br /> <br />He opened the messaging app and scrolled through the conversation with his childhood friend.<br /> <br />“It’s okay. I was right. I’ll leave a little before 7.”<br /> <br />“Alright. Take care. As we discussed yesterday, your dad and I will leave a bit later.”<br /> <br />“Got it. Thanks for the meal!”<br /> <br />“Yes, you’re welcome.”<br /> <br />Fortunately, Saito didn’t misremember the meetup time, and it remained unchanged.<br /> <br />Feeling relieved inside, Saito quickly finished the remaining food and stood up.<br /> <br />He rinsed the used dishes lightly, returned to his room.<br /> <br />“New uniforms are not my thing.”<br /> <br />Shortly after returning to his room, Saito changed into his school uniform.<br /> <br />Standing in front of the mirror, he moved around, feeling a bit uncomfortable.<br /> <br />It doesn’t go well with the tight-fitting clothes.<br /> <br />Thinking this, he undid the first and second buttons, and loosened his tie a little.<br /> <br />“This will be fine, I guess.”<br /> <br />Upon looking in the mirror, Saito’s appearance, with the tousled hairstyle and lively face, gave off a somewhat delinquent vibe, resembling some Yankee from somewhere.<br /> <br />However, reassuring himself that everyone does this to some extent, Saito left the room with his school bag in hand.<br /> </p>







<p><br />“Saito, good morning.”<br /> <br />“Good morning, Dad.”<br /> <br />“The uniform suits you.”<br /> <br />“…Does it?”<br /> <br />As Saito left the room, his father, Yo, appeared diagonally from the adjacent bedroom.<br /> <br />After exchanging morning greetings, he complimented Saito on how the uniform looked on him, seeing him in it for the first time.<br /> <br />However, considering that Saito had mistakenly thought of himself as somewhat delinquent earlier, he couldn’t help but have an indescribable expression on his face.<br /> <br />“What’s wrong? You don’t seem too happy.”<br /> <br />“No, it’s nothing.”<br /> <br />“It’s okay. You’re our handsome son, boasting good looks from me and your beautiful mother. Be confident, you’re quite good-looking.”<br /> <br />“Your self-assessment is a bit high, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />Saito may have misunderstood that Sun was trying to boost his confidence, but he was surprised by his dad’s excessively high self-evaluation.<br /> <br />Yabana, being his mother, was one thing, but Yo couldn’t be described as handsome by any means.<br /> <br />Saito thought his dad was probably exaggerating to cheer him up, but he didn’t say anything more to avoid getting scolded.<br /> <br />“Well, thanks. I’m heading out soon.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, take care.”<br /> <br />Choosing to leave the conversation before it got too lengthy,<br /> <br />Saito performed his morning routine, fixing his bedhead and brushing his teeth in the bathroom before leaving the house.<br /> <br />Since the distance from home to the station was around three kilometers and walking would take a considerable amount of time, Saito used his bicycle to commute.<br /> <br />Along the way, perhaps because it wasn’t yet the time for elementary and middle school students to go to school, there were few people, allowing him to use the sidewalk. He arrived earlier than expected, thanks to this.<br /> <br />“Wow, there are so many people at this hour.”<br /> <br />After parking his bicycle in the bike rack, Saito ascended the ticket gate and found quite a crowd. There were undoubtedly over a hundred people.<br /> <br />In this cramped station, especially before seven in the morning, Saito frowned at the unexpected number of people.<br /> <br />(Thought I could at least get a seat.)<br /> <br />It would take quite some time to reach the station where his high school was, so he wanted to sit down if possible. However, judging from the current situation, it seemed impossible.<br /> <br />With his shoulders slumped, Saito used his commuter pass to pass through the ticket gate.<br /> <br />He lined up at the nearby platform and, while collecting login bonuses from various mobile games, the train arrived promptly.<br /> <br />It was one train earlier than Saito originally planned to board, but he thought it wouldn’t hurt to go a bit earlier and boarded the train.<br /> <br />Enduring some discomfort, he swayed along with the train for a while.<br /> <br />He arrived at the station where they planned to meet.<br /> <br />As soon as he got off the train, he looked around, scanning for the figure of his childhood friend.<br /> <br />Thinking they probably hadn’t arrived yet, he looked around just in case. He noticed a crowd forming at the edge.<br /> <br />(Maybe…)<br /> <br />Even though he thought it was unlikely, Saito headed toward the commotion.<br /> <br />“That girl over there is incredibly cute, right?”<br /> <br />“Maybe she’s a celebrity? Her figure is too good.”<br /> <br />“She has blonde hair, so maybe she’s a foreigner. Damn, I can’t speak English!”<br /> <br />Upon getting closer, Saito could hear the voices of male students.<br /> <br />The moment he heard that, Saito’s suspicions turned into certainty, and following their gaze, he found an exceptionally eye-catching beauty standing there, just as he expected.<br /> <br />Her flaxen, silky hair reached down to her waist, and a part of it was braided with a ribbon of the same blue color as her eyes.<br /> <br />Moreover, she was tall for a girl, with a glamorous figure that highlighted her assets and concealed what needed to be concealed<br /> <br />– truly an ideal beauty as if drawn in a painting.<br /> <br />However, despite people gathering around, no one approached her.<br /> <br />That was likely due to the atmosphere the girl exuded. An aura as cold as a blizzard, rejecting anyone who came close.<br /> <br />While everyone shies away from her and just watches her from a distance, a boy approaches her.<br /> <br />“Hey there!”<br /> <br />Of course, that boy was Saito.<br /> <br />Disregarding the girl’s aura, the icy aura that seemed to reject anyone approaching her, Saito, in a friendly manner, struck up a conversation with the beautiful girl.<br /> <br />A gaze as cold as absolute zero was directed at Saito.<br /> <br />Upon witnessing it, everyone immediately thought, “He’s done for.”<br /> <br />“…Good morning, Saito.”<br /> <br />However, in the next moment, the frigid air dissipated, transforming into a soft warmth, welcoming Saito.<br /> <br />The surrounding people were taken aback by the abrupt change, but it was only natural.<br /> <br />Yes, the ideal beauty standing before Saito was none other than his childhood friend, Machigane Lily. They had met by chance at a campsite when they were children and became good friends.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>“Good morning, Lily. You’re here earlier than the meeting time. What are you doing?”<br /> <br />“Just felt like it. I thought Saito might come early. I never actually thought you’d come, though.”<br /> <br />“Seriously? …By the way, did my mom contact you?”<br /> <br />“Oh, busted?”<br /> <br />With a mischievous face, Lily playfully stuck out her tongue.<br /> <br />Saito was exasperated at the predictable turn of events.<br /> <br />It’s a long-standing relationship. He know well that it’s difficult to rely on instincts with her.<br /> <br />There is usually some reason when she finds Saito.<br /> <br />“I got a message from Yabana-san that Saito was leaving, so I thought I’d surprise you.”<br /> <br />“It’s impossible to be stealthy in a place with so many people.”<br /> <br />“Haha, true.”<br /> <br />Both of us look around and share a wry smile.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dn7oDs4.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>It’s quite impossible to surprise people when you’ve gathered so many.<br /> <br />“Should we move for now?”<br /> <br />“Yeah.”<br /> <br />It’s quite uncomfortable being stared at by the crowd.<br /> <br />Saito and Lily, as if avoiding the gazes, move away from the crowd, searching for an empty place.<br /> <br />“Feels weird, doesn’t it?”<br /> <br />“I know, I was thinking the same.”<br /> <br />During this time, when Lily muttered, Saito, who was thinking the same, nodded.<br /> <br />Lily and Saito have mostly spent time together either in the morning or in the evening.<br /> <br />They haven’t been together much after seven in the morning, and the discomfort of being next to each other is quite strong.<br /> <br />“Hehe, but it’s really surprising that we can go to the same high school. Honestly, with Saito’s academic abilities, I thought it was impossible.”<br /> <br />“Well, I studied like my life depended on it. It was really tough at that time.”<br /> <br />Saito and Lily’s academic abilities are quite different, and originally, they shouldn’t have been able to attend the same high school.<br /> <br />However, Saito remembers her saying she wanted to go to the same school with a lonely look on her face for a long time.<br /> <br />So, Saito decided to study hard to make that wish come true.<br /> <br />“When we met at the exam venue, it was fun to hear you muttering the textbook contents like a spell. I have a video of that, want to see?”<br /> <br />“Stop it, I don’t want to remember those times.”<br /> <br />Although he decided it for himself and has no regrets, studying like crazy for three years made his mind go crazy, and there are many embarrassing memories.<br /> <br />It was the only dark period Saito didn’t want to remember.<br /> <br />“Do you not have emotions at all?”<br /> <br />“Oda Nobunaga did Rakuichi Rakuza, and the value of pi is 3.14, and the point goes back one…!”<br /> <br />“Aaaah!”<br /> <br />“It’s because you said I don’t have emotions.”<br /> <br />The video plays, and Saito goes crazy.<br /> <br />Lily watches Saito and breathes out, thinking it’s his own fault.<br /> <br />Originally, Lily had no intention of streaming the video.<br /> <br />However, once she was told that she had no emotions, she had no choice. Her fingers pressed the play button on their own.<br /> <br />After that, the two of them got carried away with exposing each other’s dark history, and it ended in a draw.<br /> <br />The mental damage was significant, and they wanted a break, but as expected, the train was crowded, and there was no vacant space.<br /> <br />When Saito and Lily found a space just enough for the two of them, they slipped into it.<br /> <br />Holding onto the hanging strap, they gazed at the scenery passing by at an incredible speed.<br /> <br />(Hmm?)<br /> <br />When they were about to arrive at the station where their high school was, Saito unexpectedly caught sight of the suspicious movements of a salaryman with glasses nearby through the mirror.<br /> <br />Curious about what he was doing, Saito observed carefully. The man was slowly reaching out.<br /> <br />The destination was Lily’s skirt.<br /> <br />Most likely, this was a molester.<br /> <br />To stop the molester, Saito grabbed his arm, and simultaneously, someone else grabbed the man’s hand from a different direction.<br /> <br />“Molester!”<br /> <br />Immediately after, the voice of a boy echoed through the train.<br /> <br />Although his voice was the typical, unremarkable tone, it strangely permeated the heads of everyone around.<br /> <br />But, in this case, it worked in an unfavorable direction.<br /> <br />“Liar! Where?”<br /> <br />“Maybe, it’s you?”<br /> <br />“No, it’s not me.”<br /> <br />“No, it’s this person.”<br /> <br />Someone accused of being the molester.<br /> <br />Perhaps because at first, they didn’t specifically point out who this person was, everyone on the train began to doubt each other, and panic ensued.<br /> <br />Due to the unexpected event, Saito tried to calm the situation, but his voice was drowned out by the surrounding commotion.<br /> <br />“Ah!”<br /> <br />(Shit)<br /> <br />Taking advantage of everyone around them starting to move, both Saito and Lily had their arms released.<br /> <br />When they tried to catch him again, just at the right moment, the train door opened, and the man escaped.<br /> <br />“Darn, we missed him.”<br /> <br />“Saito, are you okay? Even if we catch him, without evidence, he’ll deny it, and it’ll be over. It’s pointless to chase him.”<br /> <br />“…Ugh! …Well, I guess it’s fine since I prevented it beforehand.”<br /> <br />As he was about to chase after him, Lily stopped him, indicating it was pointless.<br /> <br />Though he still wanted to pursue, she was right. Even if he caught the molester, since he hadn’t touched her, there wouldn’t be any fingerprints.<br /> <br />Saito scratched the back of his head vigorously and completely gave up the chase.<br /> <br />“Thanks for stopping it before he touched me.”<br /> <br />“It’s whatever. If you noticed, you could’ve handled it yourself.”<br /> <br />He had thought that only he noticed at that time, so he instinctively grabbed the arm to stop it. However, if the person about to be touched was aware, it was a different story.<br /> <br />Lily, being smarter than Saito, would have probably chosen a better approach.<br /> <br />Knowing that, Saito couldn’t accept Lily’s thanks wholeheartedly.<br /> <br />“But still, you know. You acted considerate towards me. It made me happy. Thank you, Saito.”<br /> <br />“…You’re welcome.”<br /> <br />However, from Lily, who has issues with men other than Saito, being touched by an unknown guy is far from ideal. Saito genuinely appreciates her.<br /> <br />Once again, conveying her gratitude while peering into his face, Saito finally understood that Lily doesn’t care about it.<br /> <br />With a slightly embarrassed expression, he turned to the side to receive her thanks.<br /> <br />Later, as they were about to leave the station, Saito noticed the boy who had stopped the groper earlier, just like he did.<br /> <br />The reason for recognizing him was the band-aid on the same spot where the boy had grabbed the man’s arm.<br /> <br />The reason he was able to find him was that the bandage was in the same position as the hand that was holding the man’s arm.<br /> <br />“Hey, thanks for earlier.”<br /> <br />“Huh, um, what?”<br /> <br />Saito rushed over to the boy, expressing his gratitude for protecting his precious childhood friend.<br /> <br />Perplexed, the boy tilted his head in confusion.<br /> <br />Perhaps due to his youthful appearance, even though he’s a boy, the way he tilts his head looks girlish. For a moment, Saito doubted if he was truly a boy.<br /> <br />“Oh, sorry about that. I didn’t explain properly. This girl is my childhood friend who was almost molested earlier. Thank God you stopped it; it really helped.”<br /> <br />“…Childhood friend? I see! That makes sense. Well, I didn’t really do anything worth being thanked for. He managed to escape, though.”<br /> <br />“He was in such a panic; there was no helping it. Besides, it’s better for an incident not to happen than to happen. You stopped it beforehand, so don’t worry about it. Though, I was a bit concerned until my childhood friend told me.”<br /> <br />“I see. Well, that’s good then.”<br /> <br />Similar to Saito a while ago, the boy didn’t readily accept the gratitude, but with some encouragement mixed with self-deprecation, the boy’s face brightened slightly.<br /> <br />“Yeah, come over here. This guy also tried to stop the groper. Make sure to thank him too.”<br /> <br />Saying that, Saito conveyed to Lily to thank the boy as well, and reluctantly, Lily approached.<br /> <br />“…Thank you.”<br /> <br />When she bowed slightly to express her gratitude, she walked away, leaving Saito behind.<br /> <br />“Hey, where are you going? My bad, she’s not great with guys. But, she’s a good person deep down. Don’t mind her too much. Well then.”<br /> <br />“Oh, wait!”<br /> <br />If he lingered, he might really get left behind.<br /> <br />Feeling sorry for the boy, Saito provided a light follow-up and chased after Lily.<br /> <br />The two of them rushed away like a storm,<br /> <br />leaving the lonely voice of the boy echoing on the platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/N1zDTW0.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“Your dislike for men is still the same. Even if you’re just saying thanks, be a bit more friendly.”<br /> <br />As they exited the ticket gate, Saito, catching up with Lily, expressed his dissatisfaction with their previous interaction.<br /> <br />No matter how much she dislikes men, that was too unfriendly. If she showed even a smile, the impression of the other person would have been better.<br /> <br />Though Saito’s words were meant for Lily’s sake, she sighed upon hearing them.<br /> <br />“But, if I act friendlier, won’t guys get the wrong idea?”<br /> <br />“Ah… yeah.”<br /> <br />A statement hitting the nail on the head.<br /> <br />It felt impactful, with a strong sense of reality. Being a beautiful girl like Lily, she probably had similar experiences many times during her elementary and middle school days.<br /> <br />Saito himself might not fully understand such feelings, but he has a foolish male friend who, just for getting his eraser picked up, mistakenly thought a girl had a crush on him and confessed, ending up rejected.<br /> <br />Certainly, having witnessed that up close, it was hard to deny.<br /> <br />“…Maybe it’s for the best.”<br /> <br />“I told you.”<br /> <br />If she doesn’t want any particular relationship, maybe it’s just right that way. It’s unsatisfactory, but Saito thought so.<br /> <br />Agreeing with Lily’s opinion, she nodded with satisfaction.<br /> <br />“By the way, if you didn’t deny it, does that mean you have experienced it too, Saito?”<br /> <br />They hadn’t had many conversations like this before, probably because of that.<br /> <br />Lily asked with great curiosity.<br /> <br />“Nah, never happened. Never liked someone just because they picked up my eraser.”<br /> <br />“It feels like your liking someone scenario is extremely limited. Anyway, at least I know there’s been nothing so far.”<br /> <br />Answering honestly, Saito, Lily said, “Well, it’s Saito,” and nodded to herself.<br /> <br />Games over fashion. Sports over shopping. Regular chain stores over stylish cafes.<br /> <br />Even as a high schooler, Saito’s sensibilities haven’t changed since childhood.<br /> </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>He’s a child who has grown physically but remains a child at heart. That’s Saito Minazuki.<br /> <br />“It seems like love is still too early for the childish Saito.”<br /> <br />“Shut up. Just you wait; I’ll definitely have a cute girlfriend and show her off before I graduate high school.”<br /> <br />“Sure, sure. I’m not expecting it, but I’ll be waiting.”<br /> <br />Though he’s somewhat aware of it, being teased for that reason still annoys him.<br /> <br />Once determined to show Lily what’s what, Saito felt a total lack of trust from her side, as she casually brushed off his intentions.<br /> <br />“We’ve arrived at school,” Lily mentioned, seemingly unimpressed by Saito’s resolve.<br /> <br />“Who cares about that… this school is still damn impressive,” Saito replied,<br /> <br />his love life reduced to a single sentence. But his attention quickly shifted to the enormous school building in front of them, boosting his spirits.<br /> <br />The school, located just outside the station, was Seira High School<br /> <br />– a prestigious institution in the county, known for producing professional athletes, celebrities, and students who make it to renowned universities.<br /> <br />Saito couldn’t fathom how he ended up here.<br /> <br />“Where do they post the class lists?” Saito asked, trying to figure out his class.<br /> <br />“Ugh, wasn’t it in front of the building?”<br /> <br />“Doesn’t seem like there are many people around. Hey, can I ask you something?”<br /> <br />Saito initially wanted to check his class, but he forgot where to find it.<br /> <br />He asked Lily, but her reaction wasn’t great, so He’s not sure if he’ll got it right.<br /> <br />Saito approached a male student taking pictures of cherry blossoms nearby.<br /> <br />“Hey, what’s up?”<br /> <br />The boy with natural curls jerked, turned towards Saito with a puzzled look on his face.<br /> <br />Judging by his reaction, he didn’t expect someone to talk to him.<br /> <br />“Oh, sorry if I startled you. I just want to check my class, but I forgot where to find it. Do you remember where to check it?”<br /> <br />“…Oh, that’s what you meant. In that case, you can check it over there in the schoolyard.”<br /> <br />Feeling a bit guilty, but satisfied with the reason, he told Saito where to find the class list.<br /> <br />“Thanks. Oh, by the way, since we’ve met here, how about telling me your name? I’m Saito Minazuki.”<br /> <br />“Akashi Kai.”<br /> <br />“Akashi, huh? Cool name. If we end up in the same class, nice to meet you. Seriously, thanks for the help.”<br /> <br />“Likewise.”<br /> <br />After expressing gratitude to Kai, Saito returned to where Lily was.<br /> <br />There was quite a distance to cover, and Saito couldn’t help but smile at how far Lily was from him.<br /> <br />It seemed like not calling her over this time was the right decision.<br /> <br />“It’s over there in the schoolyard.”<br /> <br />“Got it. Let’s go check it quickly.”<br /> <br />“It would be nice if we ended up in the same class.”<br /> <br />“I think so too, but ultimately, it’s up to luck.”<br /> <br />There were five classes in the first year,<br /> <br />so the chance of being in the same class wasn’t very high.<br /> <br />Therefore, both of them checked their classes without expecting too much.<br /> <br />“No way.”<br /> <br />“Unbelievable.”<br /> <br />When they checked their classes, they were astonished to find out that they were in the same class.<br /> <br />Moreover, since their surnames were close, their seat numbers were consecutive.<br /> <br />What incredible luck.<br /> <br />Saito and Lily were initially skeptical of the convenience of the situation.<br /> <br />“…He really exists.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Did you say something?”<br /> <br />“No, it’s nothing important. Anyway, it’s great that we’re in the same class.”<br /> <br />“Absolutely. I only knew Lily as an acquaintance in this school, so I’m really glad. Looking forward to the next year.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, me too.”<br /> <br />Although they were unsure if things would go smoothly, having Lily by his side made Saito feel more confident.<br /> <br />As Saito extended his hand, Lily squeezed it tightly in response.<br /> <br />(It seems like it’s going to be a fun year.)<br /> <br />Without any evidence, Saito had a strong feeling that he would indeed have an exciting year.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />Click, clack.<br /> <br />Climbing the stairs with the sound of loafers echoing, steps repeated countless times.<br /> <br />The stairs she had used over and over again.<br /> <br />Even though she thought she wouldn’t feel anything new at this point, the presence of her childhood friend, who wasn’t there last time, brought a sense of freshness.<br /> <br />(Really, it feels weird.)<br /> <br />With that thought in mind, she ascended the stairs lightly, one step at a time.<br /> <br />After reaching the top of the stairs and approaching the classroom, the lively noise of students reached her ears, and she finally felt a sense of nostalgia.<br /> <br />(I’ve come back.)<br /> <br />Just like last time, the classroom was noisy, and she doubted if it was truly an advanced school.<br /> <br />At the same time, she felt anxious about whether she would fit in with this class.<br /> <br />Even after a long time had passed since the time leap, this feeling hadn’t changed.<br /> <br />(Will I be able to handle this?)<br /> <br />(Maybe it would have been better if I hadn’t come?)<br /> <br />Fear crept in, and her hand, hesitating, couldn’t open the classroom door.<br /> <br />“Are you okay, Lily?”<br /> <br />Saito, puzzled by Lily’s sudden freeze, peered at her from the side.<br /> <br />[Okay! Well said. You can do it. So, go in with all you’ve got.]<br /> <br />[Yeah!]<br /> <br />(Come to think of it, that’s right. I’ve already made up my mind. I’ve been prepared for this for a long time.)<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’m fine.”<br /> <br />The moment she looked at his face, memories of their exchange from several years ago flashed through her mind.<br /> <br />Since that day, she had decided to move forward no matter what happened.<br /> <br />So, it was too late to be scared now.<br /> <br />The die had been cast ever since she decided to enroll in this high school.<br /> <br />Take a deep breath, adjusting her emotions, Lily opened the classroom door.<br /> <br />All eyes in the classroom turned towards her simultaneously.<br /> <br />It was the first time she faced them fearlessly.<br /> <br />This time, she confidently accepted the attention and took her seat.<br /> <br />A gal student with reddish-brown hair, who was nearby, then approached and started talking.</p>







<p><br /> <br />“Hey, hey, did you dye your hair?”<br /> <br />“No, it’s natural. I was born with this hair. My mother is French, so it comes from there.”<br /> <br />“Really? Nice~ I wanted to dye mine a brighter color, but the school rules limit me to this. I envy real blondes.”<br /> <br />“Haha, it’s not all that great.”<br /> <br />The gal, with sparkling eyes, envied Lily genuinely.<br /> <br />As someone who had been bullied in the past because of her hair color, Lily couldn’t express her feelings and could only respond with a dry smile.<br /> <br />“Yeah, yeah, I have a question too. Your skin is so beautiful; what cosmetics do you use?”<br /> <br />“Do you have a boyfriend!?”<br /> <br />“Where are you from?”<br /> <br />“Favorite food and type of guy?”<br /> <br />Starting with the gal’s questions, a barrage of inquiries from other students surrounded Lily.<br /> <br />Overwhelmed by the sheer number of questions, Lily regretted not escaping earlier.<br /> <br />However, it was somewhat within her expectations.<br /> <br />“I mostly use snow spirit cosmetics.”<br /> <br />“I’ll leave it to your imagination.”<br /> <br />“I don’t know if you’re aware, but it’s Yoshino Middle School.”<br /> <br />“I like sweet snacks.”<br /> <br />Having faced similar questions in her first life, Lily managed to handle them somehow.<br /> <br />In the midst of answering, she suddenly met eyes with Saito, who was a bit away.<br /> <br />His gaze, warm and reminiscent of a father pleased with his daughter’s growth, irritated Lily.<br /> <br />Despite being aware of her since childhood, Saito’s reaction seemed typical, but it annoyed her.<br /> <br />After all, she was older in terms of birthdate and mentally more mature. She wished he would stop treating her like a child.<br /> <br />(Saito, despite his age, can be quite insolent.)<br /> <br />While silently cursing him in her mind, her glare had no effect.<br /> <br />In the end, the questions from classmates continued until the teacher arrived, and Lily had to endure Saito’s gaze until then.<br /> <br />The entrance ceremony concluded without any major issues.<br /> <br />After the ceremony, students attended their first class, Physical Education.<br /> <br />Standing at the lectern, explaining the subject matter was a newly appointed female teacher, Chie Hayama, clad in a fresh suit similar to theirs.<br /> <br />Being a new teacher, she seemed quite nervous, occasionally stumbling over her words and blushing in embarrassment.<br /> <br />She covered various topics, including upcoming classes, school events, grades, textbooks, and guidelines for living at the academy,<br /> <br />using handouts for explanation.<br /> <br />“─That concludes the explanation. For now! Let’s follow these rules and enjoy a delightful three years of school life. Well then, we’ll end it here for today. Thank you very much. Be careful on your way home.”<br /> <br />The explanation lasted about thirty minutes, and the students were dismissed for the day.<br /> <br />“All right, let’s go, Lily.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, just a moment.”<br /> <br />As students prepared to leave, Saito, who had finished his preparations quickly, called out to Lily to leave.<br /> <br />Still not done packing her belongings into her bag, Lily asked him to wait a bit and continued stuffing the remaining textbooks.<br /> <br />“Okay.”<br /> <br />Once she finished packing all the textbooks, Lily stood up and walked alongside Saito.<br /> <br />“Okay, where should we go for lunch? My parents said they’d take us anywhere for my celebration.”<br /> <br />“I haven’t decided yet. Have you?”<br /> <br />“Burger King.”<br /> <br />“…It’s a special day for my enrollment. How about some expensive sushi or yakiniku?”<br /> <br />“Burger King is expensive for a hamburger joint.”<br /> <br />“Well, for a hamburger joint.”<br /> <br />Despite the plans for both families to go out for a meal later, choosing a burger shop for an enrollment celebration seemed a bit too much.<br /> <br />Lily was bewildered by her childhood friend’s unchanging love for burgers.<br /> <br />(I need to be more assertive.)<br /> <br />However, with no other options at the moment, it seemed they were headed for a burger place.<br /> <br />Lily pondered over any good alternatives, and as she did, a quiet-looking girl approached.<br /> <br />“Hey, can I ask you something? What’s the relationship between you two? I saw you coming to school together in the morning.”<br /> <br />Whether it was because Lily, who had been distant with guys, was chatting amicably with Saito, or just curiosity about their relationship, the girl approached to inquire about them.<br /> <br />“We’re childhood friends.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, that’s how it is. Well, high school is our first time going to the same school”<br /> <br />“…I see.”<br /> <br />Since there was nothing to hide, they honestly confessed about the relationship.<br /> <br />Upon hearing that, the girl’s expression became serious, and she looked towards Saito.<br /> <br />Their gazes met, and time passed with silence.<br /> <br />“…Seems like it’s true. I’m sorry for being suspicious. I just got a bit curious, that’s all.”<br /> <br />A few seconds passed.<br /> <br />Perhaps because Saito remained unfazed,<br /> <br />the girl acknowledged her misunderstanding and apologized for prying.<br /> <br />“It’s okay. If I were in your shoes, I might have thought the same. Thanks for asking.”<br /> <br />“Being told that makes me feel relieved. Sorry for taking up your time. See you.”<br /> <br />“Hey, how did it go?”<br /> <br />“It seems like they’re not dating. they’re just childhood friends.”<br /> <br />When Saito mentioned that he wasn’t bothered, the girl bowed again, bid farewell, and returned to her seat. There, she shared the recent outcome with several other girls who were waiting.<br /> <br />It seemed that her curiosity was not unique;<br /> <br />others were interested as well.<br /> <br />“They’re really getting the wrong idea,”<br /> <br />“Well, girls always love romantic gossip. It can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />Saito and Lily exchanged brief words, shared a wry smile, and left the classroom together.<br /> <br />As they did, Lily subtly tugged at Saito’s blazer, but no one in the surroundings noticed, and the two of them remained oblivious.</p>
