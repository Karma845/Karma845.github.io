<h2>Chapter 1: Love</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Yorka, shall we kiss?”</p>



<p>The art preparation room was bathed in the twilight, with just the two of us present. My beloved girlfriend, Arisaka Yorka, gently closed her eyes as if entrusting everything to me.</p>



<p>All I had to do was gently lean in towards those alluring, small lips. That was all. The distance between us slowly narrowed to zero.</p>



<p>Finally, we would exchange our first kiss. At last, we had reached this moment. Just a bit more, a little bit closer.</p>



<p>However, no matter how much time passed, I couldn’t seem to kiss Yorka. The distance between lovers remained unfilled, as though the world had momentarily stopped.</p>



<p>Yorka was right there in front of me, yet always just out of reach.</p>



<p>It was strange.</p>



<p><em>Why? What’s wrong? Did I mess up the steps? What even are the correct steps for a kiss?</em></p>



<p>I didn’t know. I had no clue at all.</p>



<p>“HOW DO YOU EVEN KISS──!?”  When I screamed, a sudden jolt of intense shock ran through my entire body.</p>



<p>“Whoa!?”</p>



<p>I woke up.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, are you awake?”</p>



<p>“H-huh? Wait, was that… a dream?”</p>



<p>Looking around, I found myself in my own room, with my little sister, who just jumped onto me, on top.</p>



<p>“It was just a dream, huh…” I sighed deeply.</p>



<p>How many times had I dreamt of a failed kiss now? Just how much did I want to kiss Yorka?</p>



<p>“Ei, stop jumping to wake me up. You’re getting too big for that; you’ll seriously break something one day,” I scolded my fourth-grade sister.</p>



<p>Her innocent, full-force dives onto me left a dull ache in my body day by day. Just two years ago, she was tiny, but she suddenly shot up in height and still in her growing phase. But her personality remained childish.</p>



<p>“Hehe. You looked like you were in pain, Kisumi-kun,” she giggled.</p>



<p>“Next time, wake me up more gently. And, call me onii-chan properly.”</p>



<p>“Got it.” She replied, but neither of those promises had ever been kept.</p>



<p>I pushed Ei aside on the bed and attempted to catch a few more minutes of sleep.</p>



<p> “Hey, Kisumi-kun. Aren’t you going on a date with Yorka-chan today? You’re going to be late if you don’t get up soon.”</p>



<p>“What time is it!?”</p>



<p>After checking the time, my drowsiness vanished. If I didn’t leave now, I’d be late for our agreed time.</p>



<p>“That’s why I woke you up. You should thank me!”</p>



<p>“My bad, Ei. Thanks! Appreciate it!” </p>



<p>Even though I had set an alarm on my phone, I must have turned it off in my daze. I hastily got ready and dashed out of the house.</p>



<p>When I opened the door, I squinted at the heat and brightness of the air. A piercing blue sky stretched above with large white clouds drifting by. The noisy chirping of cicadas filled the air. The rainy season ended quickly this year. </p>



<p>In early July, the sun was already showing its full power. Summer was definitely here.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>As I ran under the scorching sun, I barely made it onto the train in time for our meeting. After sweating all the way from home to the local station, the coolness of the train was a welcome relief. Thank you, air conditioning.</p>



<p>I transferred trains and rushed through the gates at Harajuku Station. In the shade, my girlfriend was waiting for me. Yorka, in her neat casual attire, looked more mature than when she wore a school uniform.</p>



<p>“Yorka.”</p>



<p>“Good morning. What’s with the rush?”</p>



<p>“I couldn’t wait to see you.”</p>



<p>“…Did you oversleep?”</p>



<p>“Why would you think that!? I made it on time, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you did. I was just joking.”</p>



<p>“Are you psychic or something?”</p>



<p>“It’s just that your expressions are easy to read, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s a bit unsettling.” I couldn’t help but touch my own face.</p>



<p>“…You’re easy to understand, and I appreciate that,” Yorka muttered something in a voice that I couldn’t hear.</p>



<p>“Huh, did you say something?”</p>



<p>“Never mind, let’s go!” Yorka took my hand and pulled me along, as though she couldn’t wait any longer. </p>



<p>We’d been dating for about three months. With final exams looming, Yorka had requested a date in Harajuku for today.</p>



<p>We first visited the IKEA complex right in front of Harajuku Station. The store, with its predominantly white interior, displayed chic furniture and vibrant interior decor items with bold patterns and colors all around.</p>



<p>“This one’s cute. Oh, that one’s nice too. Hey, Kisumi, what do you think about this?” Yorka looked happy, picking up items and sharing her thoughts eagerly.</p>



<p>Watching her like this was enjoyable, and discussing the scenes of various lives that each piece of furniture evoked was fun too.</p>



<p>“If we were to live together, I think I’d want a sofa about this size,” Yorka said, stretching out comfortably on a family-sized couch.</p>



<p>“A sofa this big would be perfect for cozy movie nights.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it would be nice to relax together.”</p>



<p>“But, it might be a bit too big for a two-person living space.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Wouldn’t a larger space be better for relaxing?”</p>



<p>“I’d love to have it, but you need a spacious room to fit large furniture.”</p>



<p>“Why not just live in a bigger house?” Yorka, coming from a wealthy family, stated it as if it were the most obvious solution.</p>



<p>Sure, I’d love to live in a big place filled with fancy furniture too. But a good lifestyle required money. I learned that during last summer’s vacation when I quit the basketball team and took up part-time work to earn some cash.</p>



<p>Thanks to the money I saved up instead of spending it back then, I could afford to go on dates with Yorka now.</p>



<p>“I’ll do my best,” I straightened my back with determination.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to do it alone, Kisumi. I’ll help too.”</p>



<p>“I’m lucky to have such a supportive girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“Things are always fun with you.” Just imagining a future where we’d live together filled me with excitement.</p>



<p>“Well, realistically, I think this sofa is better. Oh, it’s pretty comfy,” I remarked, settling onto the two-seater sofa.</p>



<p>“Hmm, let me see,” Yorka slid in beside me, “Oh, you’re right. It’s nice, Kisu──”</p>



<p>Our shoulders almost touched, fitting snugly in the perfect proximity. Yorka’s beautiful face was right beside mine. When she noticed how close we were, she subtly averted her gaze. Being the shy type, she blushed and tensed up, her ears turning red in no time.</p>



<p>With nowhere to escape in the cramped space, any movement would inevitably result in our arms or knees brushing against each other. Yet, she didn’t react as sensitively as she did in the early days of our relationship, when even the slightest touch would make her flinch.</p>



<p>“It’s narrower than I thought.”</p>



<p>“Probably designed this way for couples to snuggle up.”</p>



<p>Her well-defined features, elegant eyebrows framing long eyelashes, and a cute mole adorning the corner of her left eye added to her charm. Smooth cheeks, a straight nose, and perfectly shaped ears. Her small lips looked plump and inviting. Following the line of her slender neck, her outfit today revealed her collarbones.</p>



<p>Her summer dress boasted a sophisticated design in cool, summery colors. With delicate shoulders and slender arms, her snow-white skin had a hint of blush, not just from the summer heat.</p>



<p>“It does feel like our faces are really close.”</p>



<p>“They’re even closer when we hug.”</p>



<p>“But when we hug, we’re not staring at each other’s faces like this.”</p>



<p>Whenever Yorka hugged me, she always buried her face in my neck or chest, probably to hide her embarrassed expression.</p>



<p>“I guess holding hands and hugging are things we’re used to by now.”</p>



<p>“That’s because if we’re like this, we might end up kissing.”</p>



<p>Yes, for me, the most pressing matter before living together in the future was indeed a kiss.</p>



<p>It had been three months since we became a couple, yet we hadn’t kissed.</p>



<p>I had been wanting to take the next step, but I hadn’t been able to find the right moment. Yorka was my first girlfriend, so naturally, kissing felt like uncharted territory.</p>



<p>How did you smoothly initiate a kiss without making the girl feel uneasy? It was a mystery to me. If I knew, I would have long shed the title of ‘kiss virgin.’</p>



<p>During lunch breaks and after school, we were always alone in the art prep room. Honestly, there had been plenty of opportunities to kiss. But things just didn’t seem to go smoothly.</p>



<p>We sat side by side. Our eyes met. We exchanged smiles. Light touches had become routine. We held hands, occasionally hugs. Every time I was close to the alluring Yorka, my heart and body were on the verge of explosion.</p>



<p>There was a time when I tried to lean in for a kiss, but then she quickly stood up, saying, <em>“Oh, the mug is empty! Shall I brew some more tea?”</em></p>



<p>Another time, when I hesitated to let her go after hugging, she exclaimed, <em>“Kisumi, your eyes are kinda scary,” </em>and backed away, clearly frightened. I realized I had been too forward at that moment.</p>



<p>There was even a time, fueled by the relief of finishing midterm exams, when I mustered the courage to say; <em>“Yorka, how about a kiss?”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s too soon!” </em>she replied.</p>



<p>Of course, I didn’t want to push her beyond her comfort zone, and I knew I was getting ahead of myself. That’s why I struggled, failed, and endured each day, to the point where even my dreams were filled with these dilemmas.</p>



<p>Just because my dear girlfriend was right in front of me didn’t mean everything would go easily.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Huh!? W-What is it?”</p>



<p>“You’re staring at my lips too much.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, I was just thinking about kissing.”</p>



<p>“It’s so obvious.”</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s what you meant.”</p>



<p>Yorka seemed to read my every subtle reaction, more so than being an actual esper. “Do you really want to do it so badly?”</p>



<p>“I do,” I replied eagerly, perhaps too eagerly.</p>



<p>“But we’re in a public place!” Yorka noticed the attention from other patrons and quickly moved away from the sofa.</p>



<p>“Uh, would it be okay if no one was around?”</p>



<p>“It’s not about the place.”</p>



<p>“Then, what do we do?”</p>



<p>“I’ll figure it out!”</p>



<p>I hurriedly followed Yorka who was trying to avoid drawing attention.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>We continued down Takeshita Street and made our way to Omotesando. Since I wasn’t familiar with Harajuku, I was just following Yorka today.</p>



<p>“I’ve been here several times to buy clothes for my sister, so I know where the shops are. Leave it to me.”</p>



<p>“You don’t like crowds, do you?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, but I love shopping. It’s fun to pick out clothes for my sister,” Yorka said confidently as she entered a boutique that seemed a bit intimidating for high schoolers.</p>



<p>“Does your sister let you choose her clothes?”</p>



<p>“She’s very beautiful that she looks good in anything, so she’s stopped being picky.”</p>



<p>Given that she was Yorka’s sister, it was no wonder she could effortlessly pull off any look, probably could outshine any mannequin too.</p>



<p>Feeling a bit out of place in the sophisticated atmosphere of the boutique, I couldn’t help but feel a bit nervous. When I was reflected in the wall mirror, I saw a typical teenage boy, while Yorka exuded an elegant aura.</p>



<p>I couldn’t shake the feeling of being out of my league. Apart from dating such a beautiful girl, I was just an average high school student, blending into the background. A plain guy.</p>



<p>The differences that I hadn’t noticed while wearing my school uniform suddenly became glaringly obvious. After fretting over something as trivial as a kiss, I felt like a kid.</p>



<p>I glanced at the tag of the men’s t-shirt in front of me. Yeah, it was about what I expected for this kind of store.</p>



<p>“So expensive.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi, let’s head out.”</p>



<p>“Are you sure?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, nothing caught my eye anyway,” Yorka said casually after scanning the store.</p>



<p>Just like that, we entered each store that caught her eye and she would leave in no time. After visiting several places, she finally found something she liked at a well-known accessory store that even I recognized.</p>



<p>“Do you think this would suit me?” Yorka pointed to a simple silver necklace.</p>



<p>The delicate chain with a small pendant exuded an understated elegance, perfect for Yorka’s sophisticated yet cute style.</p>



<p>“It suits you perfectly. It’s really nice!”</p>



<p>“Really? Hmm, I might actually want it.”</p>



<p>“Why not try it on?”</p>



<p>“Nope. Once I try accessories on, I end up wanting them even more.”</p>



<p>“…Then how about I get it for you?”</p>



<p>“It’s okay, really. Besides, it’s probably expensive.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s make it a three-month anniversary gift.” I came up with an excuse on the spot. I could use the money I had saved up from part-time jobs for moments like these.</p>



<p>“Wait, how many months have we been together?”</p>



<p>“Depends on how you count it. You said yes to my confession at the beginning of April, so if we go from there, it’s been exactly three months. But if we count from when we officially declared ourselves as a couple, it’s been a little over two months.”</p>



<p>“That’s kind of confusing.”</p>



<p>“You bolted right after my confession.”</p>



<p>“I-I was just so happy I panicked! And, like, couldn’t you have given me some time to think about it?”</p>



<p>“If you were pretty happy, wouldn’t it have been an easy ‘yes’?”</p>



<p>“It’s hard to say that one word in the heat of the moment!!”</p>



<p>Ah, the delicate heart of a maiden. It seemed like guys were the ones in a rush for results most of the time.</p>



<p>“So, what to do? If it makes you happy, any reason for a gift works for me.”</p>



<p>“But then every occasion will turn into a gift-giving fest!”</p>



<p>“You don’t need to hold back.”</p>



<p>“That’s not it. It’s just… knowing you want to give me a present like this makes me incredibly happy.”</p>



<p>“Yorka.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I’m falling for you all over again.”</p>



<p>“Feel free to do that as many times as you like.”</p>



<p>Yorka now openly expressed her affection. Having a girlfriend who valued feelings over material things or experiences was wonderful. Hmm, but that only made me more compelled to give her gifts.</p>



<p>But then again, I worried about forcing gifts upon her and making her uncomfortable. If I couldn’t even get the timing for presents right, let alone kisses, then I guess I still had a lot to learn.</p>



<p>When we stood before a display of necklaces, a store clerk approached us.</p>



<p>“Would you like to try one on?” </p>



<p>“No, we’re good,” Yorka shut down the conversation in seconds and stepped away.</p>



<p>She was still not comfortable talking to strangers.</p>



<p>“Did you leave so quickly because you didn’t want to deal with the clerk?” I asked after we left the store.</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“I get it. I don’t like being approached either.”</p>



<p>“I just don’t feel comfortable having them around. It feels like you have to buy something just because they’ve spoken to you. And saying no is a hassle.”</p>



<p>“Especially for you.”</p>



<p>For someone who disliked being observed by others, it was understandable for Yorka to want to avoid pushy store clerks, even if it was their job. I had thought she left expensive-looking stores quickly because she was used to them. But after knowing it was because of her shyness, I felt a bit relieved. It was the Yorka I knew, after all.</p>



<p>As we strolled through the stores, I noticed that there were many wedding venues in this area. With their chic exteriors, they looked like they could be used for drama sets. A crowd of well-dressed men and women gathered outside one such venue, celebrating the newlyweds’ journey in grand style.</p>



<p>“Looks like they’re having a wedding over there. It’s quite the spectacle, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, and those wedding dresses are stunning.”</p>



<p>In the courtyard, guests on either side showered the couple with a deluge of flower petals. The bride and groom, walking through this floral shower, looked blissfully happy. Even as passersby, we were swept up in the festive atmosphere.</p>



<p>“Oh, they kissed,” I pointed out as the emotional bride pressed her lips to her groom’s cheek. Despite the teasing comments from onlookers, they were completely absorbed in what must be the happiest moment of their lives.</p>



<p>As a high schooler, I couldn’t fully grasp the significance of a wedding. Pledging to be together in sickness and in health, in front of loved ones—it was a concept I struggled to comprehend fully.</p>



<p>“It’s impressive how they can kiss in front of everyone,” Yorka remarked, her tone somewhat detached as we watched the ceremony.</p>



<p>“True, it’d be quite difficult or you,” I chuckled in agreement.</p>



<p>“I’m not a fan of events where everyone gathers to shower you with blessings. I don’t want to be the center of attention.”</p>



<p>“Well, they are the stars of the wedding, especially the bride.”</p>



<p>“Doesn’t it feel like they’re obligated to be happy?”</p>



<p>“But if they’re genuinely happy, isn’t that a good thing?” </p>



<p>“…Do you want to hold a wedding, Kisumi?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, I think it would make our families happy. I’ve been to relatives’ weddings before, and they were quite moving. Lots of tears from the bride and groom’s families.”</p>



<p>“…I’ve never been to a wedding, so I don’t really get it.”</p>



<p>“Really?” </p>



<p>“Yeah, I mean, at our age, it’s usually just family who gets invited together, right? But since my parents are overseas, even if they were invited, they couldn’t come. And my sister’s still in college and single.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>



<p>For high schoolers, unless it was a family wedding or you were invited by someone you were close to, attending a wedding wasn’t something that happened often.</p>



<p>“There’s also the expense from guests. And I’ve heard that the preparations for the bride and groom are incredibly stressful. I wonder if it’s worth all that.”</p>



<p>Yorka sounded disinterested, treating weddings as if they were happening on the opposite side of the planet.</p>



<p>“Well, there are definitely people out there who really want to be celebrated extravagantly.”</p>



<p>“Ah, in that case, my sister fits the bill. She loves anything lively.”</p>



<p>“You should definitely go if your sister has a wedding.”</p>



<p>“I should. Though I have mixed feelings about it.”</p>



<p>“Just be genuinely happy for your sister. It’s not like you dislike her, right?” </p>



<p>“I love my sister. I just don’t like being thrust into the spotlight.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, by then, I might be right there by your side.”</p>



<p>“Huh, what do you mean?” Yorka looked at me with a startled expression.</p>



<p>“Of course, if you’re okay with it, and if your family approves.”</p>



<p>“You’re getting ahead of yourself.”</p>



<p>“If we keep going like this, it’ll happen eventually.”</p>



<p>“I thought you confessed in spring, but it’s already summer. Time really flies when I’m with you.”</p>



<p>“Anyway, what matters most is that the couple is happy.”</p>



<p>“Exactly. You’re wise, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“And one more thing,” I hesitated for a moment, considering whether to bring it up.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? You don’t need to hold back with me.”</p>



<p>“—I’d love to see you in a wedding dress.”</p>



<p>Yorka would undoubtedly look stunning draped in pure white. Just imagining it was enough to conjure up beauty, seeing the reality would surely be even more exquisite.</p>



<p>“…Yorka?”</p>



<p>“If… if you’d walk beside me, I… might consider it,” Yorka replied tentatively, avoiding eye contact but still giving a positive response.</p>



<p>Dreams of weddings were nothing but fantasies for us high schoolers. However, even when I was deemed an adult, I knew I wanted to be by her side. That’s what I decided.</p>



<p>“Yeah… thanks.”</p>



<p>“I-I also want to see you in a tuxedo!” </p>



<p>Her flustered attempt to lighten the mood only made me cherish her more.</p>



<p>From the struggles of our first kiss to the distant prospect of marriage, the road ahead for us high school sophomores was still a long way off. I was still just stretching myself to reach higher. There was so much I didn’t know, so much that made me nervous. However, I never intended for this love to be just a memory of our youth.</p>



<p>I silently pledged to myself that I’d always be the man who could meet Yorka’s expectations. </p>



<p>With that silent vow in my heart, we passed by the distant wedding venue.</p>



<p>The sun blazed fiercely, and the asphalt radiated heat mercilessly. Summer dates in the city now felt like a battle for survival, akin to walking through a sauna.</p>



<p>No matter how carefree we wanted to be, staying hydrated and preventing heatstroke were crucial.</p>



<p>“I could go for something cold to drink.”</p>



<p>“I’m getting hungry too. Let’s grab lunch somewhere.”</p>



<p>Lunchtime had long passed, but it was time for a break. After spotting a suitable burger joint, we decided to head inside.</p>



<p>As soon as we stepped into the air-conditioned interior of the store, we both let out a sigh of relief. The cool air was a welcome reprieve against our heated skin. </p>



<p>When we seated at our table, I wasted no time gulping down the ice-cold lemon water provided. It was a thoughtful touch, offering a refreshing sensation.</p>



<p>I opted for the classic combo of a Teriyaki burger with fries and a cola. Yorka went for the healthier option—an avocado burger with salad and lime soda.</p>



<p>While waiting for our food, I decided to inquire about Yorka’s older sister.</p>



<p>“Your sister was quite something, wasn’t she? She started as student council president from her freshman year at our school. Thanks to her legendary reforms, events like the sports festival and cultural festival became elaborate affairs.”</p>



<p>Our school, Eisei High, was renowned for its extravagant school events, despite being an academically rigorous institution. Students took the initiative to transform mundane school events into grand spectacles, surpassing even the daily attendance of some theme parks.</p>



<p>Yorka’s older sister was the brain behind the expansion of these events.</p>



<p>“You’re well-informed,”</p>



<p>“I heard it from Kanzaki-sensei.”</p>



<p>“You really dare to bring up another woman’s name during our date. And of all people, that teacher.”</p>



<p>Yorka harbored a strong aversion towards our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki Shizuru-sensei. Because of this, Yorka didn’t appreciate me conversing with her, even though most of our discussions were either class-related or about Yorka herself.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi, what are your plans for summer break?” </p>



<p>“I may have some class rep duties at school, but you’ll always come first.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Absolutely.”</p>



<p>No matter what happened, Yorka was my top priority.</p>



<p>“Hehe, thanks. I’m looking forward to summer break,” Yorka said, her smile dazzling.</p>



<p>Ah, I was so lucky to date her. Not just because she was a beautiful girlfriend, but because she genuinely cared about me. That realization never failed to move my heart.</p>



<p>When we discussed our plans for summer break, our food arrived. Even though we came in for a late lunch at the burger joint, we ended up ordering more drinks and dessert, prolonging our stay with lively conversation.</p>



<p>Once outside, the heat had eased off, making it much more bearable. As much as I wanted to spend more time together, I couldn’t keep a girl out too late.</p>



<p>When the sun began to set, we made our way towards the station, marking the end of today’s date. It felt bittersweet. The next time we’d have a holiday date would likely be after exams, so there’d be quite a gap. While we could see each other at school and could text all we want, these moments of just the two of us were truly special.</p>



<p>As we were approaching the station, Yorka seemed restless, she was playing with the ends of her long hair. Normally, she’d be chatting away about our date, but she was oddly quiet. I didn’t mind, though. I loved gazing at her profile.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Yorka stopped in her tracks.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Um, you see—!”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“Can you, uh, listen for a sec?”</p>



<p>I bent down slightly as she approached and whispered into my ear.</p>


<div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010664.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>“Would you like to come over to my place? Nobody’s home today.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s voice was sweet and shy. </p>



<p>Summer indeed made girls a little bolder.</p>
