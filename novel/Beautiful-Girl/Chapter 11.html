<h2>Interlude: The Wailing of a Certain Person</h2>



<p> <br />I had been regretting for a long time.<br /> <br />Why did I do that on that day?<br /> <br />Why didn’t I chase after that person on that day?<br /> <br />And, alone in the room where no one was left, I always regretted.<br /> <br />That person was very important.<br /> <br />I had always wanted to protect that person.<br /> <br />Because that person was weak and fragile. I had decided in my heart to always be by that person side, so that that person wouldn’t disappear like a fleeting moment.<br /> <br />My indecisiveness couldn’t allow me to abandon others.<br /> <br />I couldn’t push away the hand of a junior who seemed as fragile and about to disappear at any moment, just like that person.<br /> <br />Because of that, that person got hurt and truly vanished.<br /> <br />I used phones, messaging apps, emails, but no response.<br /> <br />All I could hear was the cold, impersonal sound of “beep.”<br /> <br />In deep despair, when I realized, time had rewound back to my high school days.<br /> <br />Back to the day of the entrance ceremony when I first met that person.<br /> <br />Time had rolled back.<br /> <br />A miracle had happened.<br /> <br />As if, God was telling me not to make that person sad this time.<br /> <br />This time, I will make that person happy, that was my determination.<br /> <br />(What am I doing now?)</p>





<p><br /> <br />On the way home, looking at the childhood friend next to that person, I thought such a thing.<br /> <br />that person face has changed from the pained expression before.<br /> <br />that person looked genuinely happy to have found the favorite keychain.<br /> <br />That’s good.<br /> <br />It’s a very good thing that that person is happy.<br /> <br />However, the problem is that the person who looks happy is not that person, but the childhood friend.<br /> <br />Despite saying that I will make that person happy, if someone I know is in trouble, I end up helping them just like in my first life.<br /> <br />Because I know the solution to that problem.<br /> <br />Knowing that, I couldn’t just overlook it.<br /> <br />Although I wished to make only one person happy, I couldn’t ignore that others couldn’t be happy.<br /> <br />I hated myself for that.<br /> <br />(Please, quickly bring me back to that day)<br /> <br />So, I wished.<br /> <br />Wished for the day when I would have an interaction with that person to come.<br /> <br />Because if that happens, surely this time I can choose that person.</p>
