<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the end is over, the theatre slowly starts to get brighter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As most of the audience left their seats and went towards the exit, I was still sitting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today was Saturday, also the release of a mystery movie I had been looking forward to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I bought the ticket online in advance and sat in the middle seats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was really interesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, it was better than I expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is only one thing that made me unable to move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t interpret the last scene of the movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when I groan while bending front, it’s no good at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mysteries usually have an impressive, mysterious, and lingering type of ending.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I usually arrive at an interpretation myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I am not able to do it now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a good movie, so I was really frustrated.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Damn it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When everyone had gone, I stood up to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just think of it at home while slowly eating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I noticed a girl standing up beside the seat in front of me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she was hidden because of the backrest’s height so she was not visible from my position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Hello”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;This pattern has been going on for quite long”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Tachibana Rika.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, I mean, our hobbies are still close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Although it doesn’t feel like some divine mischievousness anymore, the coincidences into running her again are still incomprehensible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana and I left our seats together and sat down on a bench near the popcorn stall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, why did you come here today?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I came to see a movie. I had been looking forward to it for a long time, so I came to see it on the release date.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And why did I come?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course I don’t know. Why did you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you sure you don’t know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of us together, shrug our shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not surprised anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike the time with Kaiten-Zushi and the public baths, Tachibana is now a friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to feel frustrated at that time, but now I’m a bit happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like these kinds of movies.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. Rather, I had pretty high hopes this time.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While asking, I thought that maybe we were thinking the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a strange feeling as I wanted Tachibana to have the same reason, as well as to not have the same as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you know the movie “Android in prison” that was  released last year?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…you know too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The story has a series of scenes following the first android being arrested for committing murder as people come to visit him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;that’s right”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masterpiece.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it was a masterpiece.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, it’s my favorite movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s my favorite movie.  Also, “Meeting at the bottom of the water” was similar to “Android in prison””  </span><b>  (Kusuba)</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The director and the lead are same” </span><b>(Tachibana)</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana’s beautiful eyes were wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the slightly dim cinema hall, the shine of her eyes could be seen.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;that&#8217;s right. So, I thought it would be interesting. And it was interesting. It was interesting…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she said that, Tachibana’s expression got complex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can quite understand her feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We seem to be more alike than we thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you hungry?”</span><b> (Kusuba)</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? Yes, I am…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then, let’s talk over something to eat. I am hungry.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Alright”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana nodded with a smile, with a surprised face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I never said something like this before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after watching the same movie, going out to dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what friends do, or so I wonder.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While talking about a restaurant to eat, we both leave the movie hall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many restaurants here, so one could choose where he wants to eat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you want to eat?” (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I decide on that?” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why not? I just want an opinion”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, Tempura is good.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s too old-fashioned&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm…What do you want to eat?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I wish to eat rice. Gyudon maybe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana put her finger on her chin and turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also finally decided what to eat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;to be frank”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s Tempura, isn’t it?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s Tempura”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at each other, we nod at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was easily decided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of us started walking to a place that came to our mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of Tempura, there is only one store here that serves it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I&#8217;ve never been to that restaurant”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too “</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Tempura expensive?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s about 1500 yen. Is that okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, why though?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has a reputation for being delicious. Actually, I wanted to go there once.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope for the best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, If you’re in a tempura shop, you won’t run into people from your school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While thinking like that, I started walking to the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I realized something.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People on the way were looking over here, regardless of the gender.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected of a ridiculously beautiful girl, Rika Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I didn’t really mind the stares, and the girl in question, Tachibana, was imposing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, she didn’t seem to care about them at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, can you all stop looking at me like that while making a suspicious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t give me the, “What?! No way! Is he her boyfriend?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s completely different, really, so don’t look over here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Is it always like this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The gazes from all around.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh…Well, yes. But not as much as when I went out with Satsuki and the others.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don’t really think of it, and I don’t care”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so? That’s a little surprising.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if some stupid guys here will come over to us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not as popular with guys as you think. I’m sure the bad personality is leaking again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That sounds quite unlike you.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s not the case. Apart from my appearance, I have don’t have a high self-esteem” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying such a thing bluntly, Tachibana increased her walking speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Tachibana is not a girl who feels confident in her inner self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think there are many such people in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if they are, then they are usually not a bad person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, look at this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana showed me a piece of paper that she took out from her purse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the folding leather wallet looks quite elegant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the ticket stub of the movie, “Android in prison”. I watched this at the theatre last year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wow, maybe even I left it in mine last year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I try to find it in my wallet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a really good movie, so I saved a memorial.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…ah</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…It’s the same date and time…and the seat…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Right next to mine…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m getting scared of the coincidences…</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is quite…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tempura, which was brought to the table of 2, looked really luxurious. The appearance looked worth the price. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seafood, meat, and vegetables were so much that you couldn’t see the price.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time, I might eat a proper tempura.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me too, but where should I start from?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was puzzled but clearly excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her cheeks got slightly red, and she seemed to be itching to hold the chopsticks and start eating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had also thought of tsukemen and sushi, but I want to eat this now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t show much emotion, but when I see food, my eyes shine like a child&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After all, there’s a shrimp with 2 tails.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">““Itadakimasu””</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, we join our hands together and take a bite of the shrimp.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Mmmmm</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really good…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really tasty…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seriously?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Tachibana’s way of speaking is jumbled up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I felt I can relate to that feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, it’s so delicious that it can’t be compared to any tempura I’ve had up until now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the rice and sauce are also good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tea they gave is also delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is this shop&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a big meal…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Will you be able to eat everything?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana is quite delicate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m really worried about how this will go in my stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big eel in the bowl is bigger than Tachibana&#8217;s face anyway.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Delicious food is different”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, it’s scientifically impossible”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can eat it while we digest it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is some messed up logic”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Logic is powerless in front of delicious food.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending with a mysterious quote, Tachibana proceeded with her chopsticks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also follow suit, slowly eating the tempura in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are eating something delicious, concentrate on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s exactly what we did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I came here to discuss the movie, but I’m eating the tempura instead.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I didn’t know it would be this tasty in the first place, so it can’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s impossible to talk while eating this tempura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, defeat the shrimp, and eat the scallops, and finally to the eel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was tired of eating the eel, I put the sweet pepper in it, and my entire mouth was refreshed and my appetite returned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s a very good combination of the ingredients.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bit expensive for high-school students, but the amount is good, and above all, it’s really delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, my bowl gets empty first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a breath, I looked over to Tachibana. Tachibana looked a little bit forceful, but still happy, gnawing at the scallops in the Tempura.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stare at Tachibana’s face unintentionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cute nose, small lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big and dignified eyes were narrow, giving it a pictorial charm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This girl is ridiculously beautiful after all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the eating face, I think it looks really good for modeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it can’t be helped when people at school or the road look at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, I became friends with Tachibana, and we are having Tempura in a shop now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I may have made way too much progress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First finish the bite, then talk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mmm…uh. Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then why were you looking at me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Hmm.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said that, Tachibana puffed her cheeks in a grumpy manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she immediately held her chopsticks and smiled happily while eating again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Busy girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mm…Gochisosamadeshita”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gochisosamadeshita”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; he said.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tachibana finished her tempura, both of us joined our hands again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana seems to be suffering a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We weren’t able to talk about the movie, so let’s relax for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really delicious; I’ll add it to my favorites list”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’ll do the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusuba-san, you have a list?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I do. There is the Tsukemen shop, a meal shop near the school, and a few more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A meal shop? I didn’t know about that one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, they’re really tasty. And the best thing is that it’s really quiet”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems nice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Next time, I&#8217;ll tell you where it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana probably likes that kind of atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, what’re Tachibana’s favorites”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The cake shop near the public bath is really nice. Also, a yakiniku restaurant in front of the station”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Yakiniku- basically grilled meat)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yakiniku?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a fascinating place it sounds like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a good shop, interested?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, let’s exchange information about our favorite shops.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, our “Introduction to recommended restaurants” continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because of this, when we started to bring the topic of the movie, which is what we had to do in the first place, the tension between us had risen strangely.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.4</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, the heroine is definitely the culprit. She also killed the hero who saw the murder. I know it, so I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s true”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The heroine got misunderstood. The hero killed himself before so that the heroine would not have to kill him. But the heroine thought that she did it. That&#8217;s why the heroine who noticed it, in the last scene, broke down in tears.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She cried in the last scene because she regretted killing the hero, right? And if you want to keep the heroine from committing a crime, there are many other ways to do it than to kill yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…That’s right, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, see, that’s why my interpretation Is correct”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;But you aren’t completely convinced, are you? T don’t think the director&#8217;s work would be that simple. Right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ehh…that’s right. But if you just start guessing randomly on your own while it wasn’t shown in the movie, you’ll reach nowhere”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure it wasn’t there. We may have missed it, or misinterpreted it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I joined my hands and groaned. Tachibana put a finger on her chin, and suddenly looked upwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, there was no correct answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that what I said is correct.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Tachibana also has a point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her point also can’t be ignored.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was probably also thinking the same thing. She shook her head side-to-side trying to desperately remember the contents of the movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Would you like to see it again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san, let’s see it again. Fortunately, the last replay will start soon, if we are quick, we might get the seats.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see, that’s for the best, then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana and I nodded to each other and paid the bill for the tempura in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farewell, 1600 yen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is a very expensive day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short run, we returned to the movie theatre and operated the ticket machine together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cinema was much more crowded than I had thought it would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that they might not have a seat anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…This is”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 2 seats were vacant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only 2 serial numbers, together</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But our fingers were frozen in place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because that seat…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pair seat…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san, this is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well…Maybe it’s a seat for 2 people, I don’t know because I never sat there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking face to face, we remained silent for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Tachibana’s eyes and facial expression, I couldn’t see what she was thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s take it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;EH?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just a normal seat, but just doesn’t have an armrest in between”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we don’t buy it right now, even this will be filled.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh? Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tachibana said that, she pressed the buy button without permission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went along with the flow and also added my money in the machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was only 1 ticket that came out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pair seat ticket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san, come one, let’s go.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh god…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without any concern at all, Tachibana went towards the theatre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept a little distance for a few meters while following her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusuba-san, hurry up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, yes”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It seems that you can’t enter the theatre with the pair ticket if both of the people are not present. Please don’t go anywhere”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All right, all right”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went to stand beside Tachibana, who was being glared at by the staff.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, I have no clue what she is thinking or what she is not thinking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or is it normal for friends to use pair seats? Is it only me who doesn’t know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it’s definitely not like that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looks at me with a mysterious face as I sigh.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.5</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our seat was placed right along the wall, facing the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The front seats and the back seats made it a bit squashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I bought the tickets for the movie at the last moment, so it can’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the problem is&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not what I expected…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couple-seat was narrower than I expected.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was barely wide enough for 2 people to sit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No…this is clearly close physical contact, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible now, isn’t it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do we do…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…It can’t be helped. We have already bought the ticket, and it would cause a nuisance to others if we keep standing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;are you serious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana sat toward the wall side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Tachibana who is usually calm and composed had hard movements and a stiff expression.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tachibana was prepared to sit down, so I couldn’t refuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the aim is to watch the film again and deepen the understanding of the movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not good to think more than you should.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not good…yes…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Hey, Tachibana</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t go to that seat, it’s hard to see there, I’ll go instead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…is it really okay?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Thank you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana accepted my proposal obediently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly changed seats with Tachibana and went to my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down next to Tachibana with no emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I sat down, I noticed that it was small and I couldn’t sit properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our shoulders were touching, but it was not that cramped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I can’t help the feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel my face getting hot from tension and embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s what it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the princess hug from the other day, this might not be so much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel that that comparison is a little strange, but I have to think like that for this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While watching the advertisements for other movies, I try to kill my brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some time, the theatre went completely dark and the screening began again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps there are some important scenes somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I try to watch every scene carefully so I don’t miss any important information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was staring at the screen without making a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hyaa!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one scene, she did a small shriek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her shoulders squeezed together as her body stiffened with a frightened expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work is a mystery, but the whole progression of the story is in a dark, horror-like atmosphere from the start to the end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were some surprising jump scares. When I first saw it, I heard the audience scream sometimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m quite tolerant of horror, and it’s my second time watching the movie, so I wasn’t that scared anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hyaa!”</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana started to scream more as the horror scenes in the movie intensified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was the one who told me to see the movie again…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s the 2nd time she’s watching it…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I spoke to her in a small whisper, she looked surprised at my voice and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry about me, I’m fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really,,,,?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the scene with heavy rain, the loud thunder suddenly sounded. Now able to handle anymore, Tachibana finally clung to my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, there was this scene…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uhhh, I am too&#8230;I completely forgot about the thunder…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana buried her face in my arm and glanced at the screen with only from one eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, this girl is scared of too many things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m usually resolute and composed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But… I’m not able to concentrate on the film…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, get off…isn’t it okay now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That…I said…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was speaking in a soft voice.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, whatever Tachibana is afraid of, I will not judge. But I want you to stop hugging me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I had done something similar once, I can’t help but feel a bit strange again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, really, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is she even aware of her cuteness?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My concentration is wavering because of Tachibana’s soft touch on my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first place, is she not even embarrassed…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn’t it normal to hold a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">boyfriend’s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arm, shouldn’t a girl resist otherwise?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well…The bad scenes will end in some time…please wait until then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did you even endure the first time…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was still alright at that time… Probably because the woman sitting next to me was more scared than I was…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That logic where you get extra courage when you see someone who is more scared than you are?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can&#8217;t be helped, let’s just have some patience…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah…. wait a sec…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure that after this scene is…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;HYAAA!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I remembered, the most amazing scene of the movie came out.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana seemed to have completely forgotten about the movie and clings to me while crying and firmly sticking her body to mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No…This is not good…!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seats were already narrow enough, and we were now almost in a hugging position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My conscience completely leaves the screen from the situation, and Tachibana, who lost herself already, doesn’t try to leave me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn! What a stupid situation…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not to review the movie now, rather two lovers openly flirting in the couple seats of a theatre.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I can’t force the scared Tachibana clinging to me to stop hugging me.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I started stroking Tachibana’s head and back until she calmed down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, Tachibana must come back to her senses as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">God, please forgive me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have an ulterior motive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please give me a fair judgment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While chanting the mantra in my head, I had completely given up watching the movie.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.6</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the film got over, we were completely silent, not exchanging any words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We leave the cinema together and start walking to our home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was completely dark now, but I still don’t think we should go to eat dinner together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no content regarding the second half of the film in my mind.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, we were hugging each other through it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, forget watching the movie to understand the ending better, I couldn’t even think about the interpretation of the ending.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking like this, this story may be incomprehensible and silly but there is a deeper meaning to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, actually, it wasn&#8217;t wrong to say that the reason was rather simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, even when I tried to push off Tachibana, she firmly grabbed me and refused to let go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the couple seat was very narrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was quite difficult to change your position once you sat down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all the reasons it happened.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very simple and easy to understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But no matter how simple the reason may be, the situation was not simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, we were hugging each other for more than an hour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is definitely not something friends do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let alone I, the dark background mob, and that too with the transcendent beauty Tachibana Rika.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than that, I was desperate to keep my chest from pounding, and when I asked if I wasn’t happy with that situation, I’ll have no choice but to deny it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Above all, what I actually think in my heart is that I feel sorry for Tachibana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, she was in a very desperate state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wouldn’t have been able to do anything by herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, I could’ve torn apart Tachibana if I used a little more force, rather, I think I should’ve done that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was Tachibana who clung to me, depending on how you look at it, it’s basically sexual harassment by taking advantage of the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was thinking about all these things the whole time walking silently with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was probably because Tachibana wasn’t talking about anything or starting a conversation.</span></p
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is at least Tachibana&#8217;s kindness that he doesn’t try to go home alone first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…I wonder how I should apologize…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Tachibana”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kusuba-san” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unexpectedly, we spoke at the same time and we both stopped suddenly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m feeling like this awkwardness will end up killing me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Tachibana had a face that seemed somewhat apologetic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;First, may I?” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, sure…” (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I answered, Tachibana straightened her legs and unexpectedly bowed her head down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you doing?</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why on earth did you bow for?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…I’m sorry. We had gone to see the movie again, but I messed it up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Moreover, I lost my composer and clung to…I made Kusuba-san feel uncomfortable…I’m really sorry for all that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Eh? you did care about that kind of thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tachibana raised her face, she had a strange expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can feel the power of my body slowly flowing out.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you really care about such a thing and keep silent about it until now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that&#8217;s the case, I guess she’s quite an idiot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, maybe this is just Tachibana Rika.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you ask me, it’s true that I can’t see it like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, for me, that&#8217;s not the case&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t really matter” (Kusuba)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ow! That hurt…” (Tachibana)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did a light chop on her head while feeling relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looked at me with a grudge-like expression, while holding her head with both her hands and eyes becoming tearful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I was just depressed a bit. Why were you so worried about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, because you had a difficult face ever since you left the theatre. And it’s probably my fault if you’re angry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s not like that, It’s just that I didn’t like being in close contact with someone for a whole hour.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I yelled to make her understand, she still seemed a bit far off.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Do you care?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Huh?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sigh.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana seemed to be greatly disappointed and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so annoying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I was really relieved by Tachibana’s words, even though I didn’t really understand what they meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’re an idiot aren&#8217;t you, Kusuba-san.&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, maybe Kusuba-san has always been that type of person. Please return my worries about you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, come on!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, from that point of view, The way Kusuba-san wants to take advantage of people&#8217;s weakness does seem like sexual harassment.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t just say that out loud!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many times you scream or yell, this girl…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tachibana didn&#8217;t really seem to care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, we were both silent and feeling worried about each other and realized the other party didn’t care at all.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now what?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ok, Alright, that’s enough. I’ve lost my mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s my line”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We started walking again, making frivolous conversations, reproaching each other in a friendly atmosphere, and criticizing each other&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, I didn’t reach any conclusion of the interpretation of the movie, but I got more familiar with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you think about it, today’s events aren’t that bad, are they?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;but”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, who was walking a little behind, said in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…why do I not feel disgusted when I stick close to Kusuba-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was that question directed to me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or did she ask herself?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided not to answer to that and pretend as if I didn’t hear anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana didn’t say anything after that.</span></p>
