<h2>Chapter 15: The First Solo Clear</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>&quot;Details!? About Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis?! A-And a treatment for it?!&quot;</p>

<p>I approached the pop-out in surprise and read the words aloud. It contained details about Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis and stated that there was no access to a treatment for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Details... If I focus on what I want to know in my status, will the details appear?&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed that by focusing on what one wanted to know in their status, more detailed information would appear. However, not everything would be displayed, only specific things. Detailed information about one's job or skills would also appear, but sometimes access would be denied.</p>

<p>&quot;Access denied... If I level up this strange skill, maybe... I'll be able to find a cure for Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis?!&quot;</p>

<p>I had the skills &lsquo;Eye of God&rsquo; and &lsquo;Access Permission&rsquo;, which I obtained from clearing that golden cube, but my Access Permission was only at Level 1.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know how to level up my skills, but it's probably in the dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p>In this world, skills were recognized, but people used them without knowing their proper names or effects. For example, the well-known skill &quot;Provocation&quot; could gather agro from dungeon monsters.</p>

<p>However, no one knew if its official name was actually &quot;Provocation&quot;.</p>

<p>It was just a name that people started calling it.</p>

<p>Since I could see my status, I would probably be able to see the skill's name, or maybe the name that people had given it would be displayed.</p>

<p>&quot;I've heard that clearing dungeons and getting stronger skills is possible. So, maybe!&quot;</p>

<p>I held onto hope.</p>

<p>The cure for Amyotrophic Magic Sclerosis, an incurable disease that millions of people suffer from around the world and that no one had been able to understand, might be found.</p>

<p>If so, Nagi would be able to wake up.</p>

<p>I will help Nagi, who is trapped in darkness in her own body.</p>

<p>I held Nagi's hand tightly.</p>

<p>It's still cold as ever.</p>

<p>But still, she's alive, so there remains a possibility that she'll smile again.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll help you, Nagi. Just wait a little longer. I'll definitely save you. And when I do...&quot;</p>

<p>I made a vow to Nagi, who couldn't respond.</p>

<p>&quot;Smile for me like you always do.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, Ijuin-sensei and Yamaguchi-san. Thank you in advance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, leave it to us. Though there's a limit to what I can do.&quot;</p>

<p>I said goodbye to Ijuin-sensei and Yamaguchi-san from the home care service and left the hospital. It was already past noon, but it didn't feel like much time had passed since I woke up at home this morning.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to dive into the dungeon, completely clear it to gain rewards, and become stronger. If I do that, maybe I can go to higher level dungeons and increase my skills.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to dive into the dungeon.</p>

<p>With this 24 million yen sword, I should be able to solo even an E-class dungeon.</p>

<p>But there's a catch.</p>

<p>&quot;The dungeon points are the problem...&quot;</p>

<p>Dungeon points are the ironclad rule set by the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>When applying to dive into a dungeon, they are allocated based on the strength of the members.</p>

<p>To dive into a dungeon, the total point count must be 10 points.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to dive into an E-class dungeon, you will be given 2 points for each E-class clearer. In other words, you just need five E-class clearers.</p>

<p>From there, for every higher-ranked clearer that participates, an additional 2 points are added.</p>

<p>So if a D-class clearer participates in an E-class dungeon, it becomes 4 points, and if there are two D-class and one E-class clearer, the total points become 10.</p>

<p>For a C-class dungeon, it's 6 points, so you can apply with one D-class or two E-class clearers.</p>

<p>What about unranked clearers? Zero points, of course.</p>

<p>They are treated the same whether they are present or not.</p>

<p>These are the rules for applying to dive into a dungeon.</p>

<p>There are some finer points, but this is the basic rule.</p>

<p>You can't just dive into a dungeon which could put your life at risk.</p>

<p>It's the ironclad rule set by the association that has caused numerous casualties in the dungeon. And if you dive into the dungeon without applying to the association, it's the same as poaching.</p>

<p>It's like stealing resources from the dungeon.</p>

<p>If you're caught, your clearer&rsquo;s license may be revoked. In the worst case, you could receive a prison sentence as a criminal.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, what should I do? But then again, there's the reward for complete clear...&quot;</p>

<p>I pondered. This is a crime.</p>

<p>But, looking at the status of various Cubes today, I realized that for most Cubes, to completely clear them, being solo is a prerequisite.</p>

<p>I, who have spent my life protecting rules, for the first time am going to break them.</p>

<p>I had quite a bit of resistance towards it, similar to the feeling of shoplifting.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I've made up my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;I prioritize Nagi over the rules! If I get caught... I'll apologize and rely on Tanaka-san!&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to just go for it.</p>

<p>Above all else, Nagi is the most important thing to me.</p>

<p>If that means breaking the rules and causing trouble for Tanaka-san, then so be it.</p>

<p>And as for a higher level dungeon, that's another story, but for an E-ranked one, I shouldn't get in too much trouble.</p>

<p>Because there isn't that much money involved.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, it's like shoplifting versus bank robbery.</p>

<p>With higher level cubes, you can make billions with just one clear, but with E-ranked dungeons, it's only a few thousand yen.</p>

<p>That's why I-</p>

<p>&quot;I'll do my best!&quot;</p>

<p>decided to aim for a solo clear.</p>

<p>That being said, I don't want to get caught, so I've decided to aim for a dungeon in the sparsely populated countryside.</p>

<p>I know I'm being cowardly, but it's better to not get caught.</p>

<p>I returned to the guild and used a computer to look up a list of cubes in Japan.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's see... there are quite a few. There are over 200 E-ranked cubes in Japan alone...&quot;</p>

<p>There were over 200 E-ranked cubes throughout Japan.</p>

<p>I'd mainly been active in Tokyo, so I didn't know much about the countryside or how they were clearing dungeons.</p>

<p>Even though it's called the countryside, it's only a little ways away from Tokyo.</p>

<p>Looking at the map of Japan, most of it could be considered countryside, just forests all around this country.</p>

<p>That's when I fixed my gaze on one location on the map.</p>

<p>Countryside or rather mountain? I set my sights on a Cube in a close by town and headed from Tokyo towards the direction of Mount Fuji.</p>

<p>&quot;The location is Shimamura? They probably sell Western-style clothes there.&quot;</p>

<p>I decided to secretly complete the cube in that village. It seemed like it would take about three hours to get there by train and bus.</p>

<p>Without further ado, I prepared myself and set off.</p>

<p>Honestly, there was also the slightly violent reason that I wanted to test this sword out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a guy so I can&rsquo;t help but get excited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I kind of understood the feeling of a killer, but of course not enough to direct it towards people. I embarked on the three-hour journey.</p>

<p>It felt like a solo trip without any real plans, but that was exciting in itself.</p>

<p>As for money, I had savings that I could use.</p>

<p>Luckily, Tanaka-san covered my medical expenses, so I had some spare cash.</p>

<p>Two hours being shaken around on the train and one hour being shaken around on the bus.</p>

<p>After using the regular public transport system, I arrived in Shimamura.</p>

<p>Looking around, there were so many rice fields and small houses that it made me question whether I was still in the same world.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, the air here is so fresh! This is the countryside! It's like I've traveled back in time.&quot;</p>

<p>The peaceful countryside is so tranquil that you can almost hear the murmuring of the river. Despite the loud chirping of the cicadas, the air carries the delightful scent of the countryside. Natural sounds are the only thing audible, enough to make you forget about the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>

<p>Although I ended up wandering aimlessly, it's already 4 pm in the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright, let's do our best before it gets dark!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ran from there to the cube.</p>

<p>As an unranked person, I had to take breaks like an ordinary human, but in the end, I reached my destination.</p>

<p>In the middle of a remote mountain, the Cube stood quietly there.</p>

<p>The area around it was cleared and turned into a square-like plaza in the midst of the forest. Clearers probably take measures regularly to prevent a dungeon collapse.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so this is the cube here. Blue... alright, it's an E rank.&quot;</p>

<p>I gazed at the cube that shone suspiciously like sapphire.</p>

<p>Then, just like with the Tokyo cube, the status was displayed.</p>

<p>Remaining Magic Power&#65306;43/50&#65288;+1/24hr&#65289;</p>

<p>Clear Difficulty&#65306;E Rank</p>

<p>&#9670;Reward</p>

<p>First Clear Reward&#65288;Complete&#65289;&#65306;Magic Power +10</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition(s) 1&#12288;While the dungeon hasn&rsquo;t been cleared before, defeat the boss.</p>

<p>Complete Clear Reward&#65306;Current access level is unable to display this.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;Clear while solo.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 2&#12288;Defeat a 100 or more Blue Bears.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 3&#12288;Defeat the boss within one minute&#12290;</p>

<p>&quot;...Blue Bear. If that's the weakest monster, I should be able to handle it.&quot;</p>

<p>They were a species called Bear type, resembling bears but were considered a type of animal. They were referred to as beast types which included many different types such as wolves, bears, and lions.</p>

<p>They appeared in the same color as the Cubes, which was their basic feature.</p>

<p>Of course, their appearance was far from that of a bear and was more filled with killing intent. But if asked what they resembled, it would be a bear.</p>

<p>And the Blue Bear was the weakest of these bears with a blue appearance.</p>

<p>Each Cube&rsquo;s individual species, also known as &lsquo;Color type&rsquo;, had the same appearance except for their color, but their strength varied greatly depending on the color.</p>

<p>Even so, this E-class Cube with the same blue color was known as the weakest color, so I should be able to handle it.</p>

<p>&quot;Speaking of which, if this remaining magic power reaches its maximum value of 50, does it cause a dungeon collapse? If so, defeating monsters or bosses should reduce the remaining magic power, extending the deadline. If that seems to be the case, it makes sense.&quot;</p>

<p>I would have to defeat dungeon monsters and bosses regularly and enter rest mode.</p>

<p>As a result, I speculated that the remaining magic power would probably disappear.</p>

<p>If I can test it out, I should.</p>

<p>&quot;Now then, let's go. I wonder if it's because of this weapon that I'm not as scared as before? Or is it...&quot;</p>

<p>I approached the cube without any hesitation.</p>

<p>Although it was E-class, I would have been too scared to enter alone before. But now, I didn't feel like I would lose.</p>

<p>Of course, this was probably also due to my equipment being far beyond what was expected of me.</p>

<p>But maybe it was also because I faced true death inside the Golden Cube and was able to stick to my will.</p>

<p>Compared to those immensely powerful monsters, there was no fear in facing the weakest blue type.</p>

<p>My heart raced, my body was tense, and I was nervous.</p>

<p>But I knew this feeling wasn't fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, here I go!!&quot;</p>

<p>I touched the cube, and with a crisp sound, the beautiful walls rippled with blue and gently welcomed me.</p>

<p>On this day, I began my first solo dungeon clear.</p>

<p>There was no fear, only one thing.</p>

<p>This pounding in my chest.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>&quot;Cave-type, huh... A little dark, but I can just barely see.&quot;</p>

<p>I open my eyes in the cramped, suffocating space.</p>

<p>I'm surrounded by a stone-enclosed cavern that emits a true &lsquo;dungeon&rsquo; feeling.</p>

<p>There are various types of dungeons: cave-like places, man-made looking temples, snowy mountains that seem like other worlds, and grasslands.</p>

<p>Dungeon might just be a name; it might be better to call them other worlds. Well, originally, they were called the Great Labyrinths of Another World, but dungeon is easier to understand.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, it's no good to simply clear it. Still, strategy is vital for survival. Let's not do anything reckless.&quot;</p>

<p>I proceed through the dungeon alone.</p>

<p>This dungeon has already been explored, and a map has been made.</p>

<p>I downloaded the map onto my smartphone and open it.</p>

<p>If I can follow this route, it should be clearable in two or three hours.</p>

<p>I grip the sword at my waist and proceed cautiously.</p>

<p>Then, a drooling blue bear emerges from the shadows.</p>

<p>Its skin is a dull blue color, and its size is about the same as mine.</p>

<p>A Blue Bear, being blue which is called the weakest color, is slightly smaller than a regular bear.</p>

<p>Still, there's no way a person can handle a regular bear with their bare hands, but I have this sword now.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, can I see the status of monsters?&quot;</p>

<p>I consciously stare at the Blue Bear, and as expected, I can see its status.</p>

<p>Name: Blue Bear</p>

<p>Magic Power: 10</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;40%=4</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;20%=2</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;40%=4</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;0%=0</p>


<p>&quot;I see! I can see it! It's stronger than me barehanded, but... it looks quite weaker than I expected. Alright, then... phew... let's go!&quot;</p>

<p>I ready my sword and crouch down.</p>

<p>Judging by its status, it's stronger than me, but with this sword equipped, I seem to be considerably more powerful.</p>

<p>Then, the Blue Bear notices me and charges at me, drooling.</p>

<p>If this had happened before, I might have hesitated or involuntarily closed my eyes.</p>

<p>But, not now.</p>

<p>&quot;It looks slower, no, that's not it. I&rsquo;m just not looking away.&quot;</p>

<p>I can see the Blue Bear's movements clearly.</p>

<p>For a moment, I thought it was because of the Eye of God but that's not it.</p>

<p>I'm just calmly focused on every move it makes.</p>

<p>I simply don't look away.</p>

<p>And with that, the world seems to change.</p>

<p>&quot;Compared to that damned demon angel!!&quot;</p>

<p>Compared to that embodiment of terror, that demonic angel, the Blue Bear is nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;It's just a beast!!&quot;</p>

<p>With a single strike, I slash down the Blue Bear from above.</p>

<p>My attack power, strengthened by this weapon, can kill the weakest E-class magical creature in one hit.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... I wonder if I've become stronger.&quot;</p>

<p>I definitely felt more confident in that battle.</p>

<p>The weapon has indeed made me more powerful, so my attack power has increased, but the process leading up to landing a hit was clearly different for me than from before.</p>

<p>Could it be called high-altitude training?</p>

<p>The Blue Bear really felt weaker, and I didn't feel like I would lose at all.</p>

<p>But I can't be careless.</p>

<p>My defense status hasn't changed at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, another one's coming. As for the magic stones... I'll pass on picking them up. I don't know how to explain this to the guild.&quot;</p>

<p>As I stared at the Blue Bear's corpse while reassessing my strength, two more Blue Bears emerged from the shadows.</p>

<p>I took the same stance. Even if it's two against one, I don't feel like I will lose.</p>

<p>I would usually pick up the magic stones, but I decided to give up because I wouldn't be able to explain it when cashing in at the guild.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>An hour later.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... this is quite a challenge, but... hmph!&quot;</p>

<p>I had defeated my 60th Blue Bear.</p>

<p>I had already found the boss room, but the condition for a complete clear is to defeat 100 Blue Bears.</p>

<p>So, I search every corner of the dungeon, looking for places where Blue Bears are hiding.</p>

<p>It felt like a quest in a hunting game to search around and hunt a bunch of the same monster.</p>

<p>They're hard to find. Damn it, where are you &lsquo;weakest bear&rsquo;?</p>

<p>&quot;That's why there aren't many people who have completely cleared it so far. As well as being solo, this dungeon might not even have 100 monsters...&quot;</p>

<p>As I continued searching, I could hardly find any more after I surpassed 90.</p>

<p>I sat down in the dungeon, spreading out the water and rice balls I had bought at a convenience store, expecting it to be a long journey.</p>

<p>It was already past 8 PM.</p>

<p>&quot;Only five more to go, let's hang in there a little longer...&quot;</p>

<p>I was quite tired, but the sheer number of 100 was simply a lot.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!? They're here!!&quot;</p>

<p>Despite my fatigue, I kept searching the dungeon.</p>

<p>Then, I found a group of five Blue Bears near what seemed to be a cave's water edge. Desperate to suppress a cry of joy, I raised my sword and approached the Blue Bears.</p>

<p>By now, I had searched so much that the joy of finding them was greater than that of winning the battles.</p>

<p>&quot;That makes 100!!&quot;</p>

<p>After defeating the 100th Blue Bear, I felt victorious.</p>

<p>By now, I could easily handle 5 vs. 1 as I had figured out their habits.</p>

<p>&#12302;Condition 2 has been achieved.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they're telling me. How kind.&quot;</p>

<p>The cold, mechanical voice echoed in my head.</p>

<p>The voice that one could here when having cleared a Cube, called by us as heaven&rsquo;s voice. It informed me that I had achieved the second condition of completely clearing the dungeon.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad. If I had miscounted and found out I was one short after defeating the boss, I would've gone mad.&quot;</p>

<p>With a small victory pose, I headed toward the boss's room.</p>

<p>The boss's room was always behind a large door, just like in any other Cube.</p>

<p>I had only seen E-class boss doors firsthand, but I had seen images of other boss doors on the internet.</p>

<p>Grander or rather solemn, they became larger and more ominous as their ranks increased.</p>

<p>I exhaled deeply, replenishing my oxygen.</p>

<p>I wasn't scared, but it was still the boss.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and switched my mindset from the relaxed one I had just moments ago.</p>

<p>The E-class boss, in other words, an opponent on par with a hobgoblin with a broken left hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright!&quot;</p>

<p>I opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>The large square room was dimly lit by torches with blue flames.</p>

<p>In the center was the boss of the Blue Bears.</p>

<p>Its fur was a different shade of blue from the dull-colored Blue Bears - it was sapphire blue, just like the cube itself.</p>

<p>The beautiful color was highly sought after as a material for high-end clothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Sapphire Bear... It's huge. It's even bigger than me.&quot;</p>

<p>The sleeping Sapphire Bear slowly rose to its feet as it noticed my arrival.</p>

<p>It drooled as it stared at me.</p>

<p>I had heard its name before, but this was my first time seeing the jewel-like bear that was both beautiful and powerful.</p>

<p>I readied my High Wolf Fang Sword.</p>

<p>As a C-class monster, the High Wolf was far more powerful.</p>

<p>The Sapphire Bear seemed cautious, perhaps recognizing the weapon made from the material of its superior.</p>

<p>Then, the battle began with the howl of a wolf.</p>

<p>I put everything into it from the start because the third condition was to defeat the boss within a minute.</p>

<p>I had no time to scout it out first.</p>

<p>As we both charged at each other, our paths crossed.</p>

<p>The Sapphire Bear tried to bite me, but I passed downwards.</p>

<p>It went just as I had anticipated.</p>

<p>Having hunted 100 Blue Bears, I had grasped the tricks and habits of their combat.</p>

<p>If there was something they could bite in front of them, they would prioritize biting over slashing.</p>

<p>That's why I didn't dodge head-on until the last moment.</p>

<p>As expected, the Sapphire Bear lunged to bite at my throat.</p>

<p>With limited options, it was easy to dodge the anticipated bite trajectory.</p>

<p>I crouched under the bear's jaw and, combining the force of my legs, I thrust my dagger forcefully from below into its throat.</p>

<p>I then put more force into the embedded sword and pierced through the Sapphire Bear's skull.</p>

<p>Without a chance to cry out, the Sapphire Bear, as if entrusting its weight to me, died.</p>

<p>At that moment, I successfully defeated a boss solo for the first time.</p>

<p>&quot;I did it. I really thought it through and defeated it. Me... unranked me!&quot;</p>

<p>I laid the Sapphire Bear down and wiped the bloodied sword.</p>

<p>After finishing my first boss battle, I felt as if I had grown a little stronger.</p>

<p>That was probably just a matter of mindset.</p>

<p>&#12302;Conditions 1, 2, and 3 confirmed, complete clear reward will be granted.&#12303;</p>

<p>The usual system voice played simultaneously with the boss's defeat.</p>

<p>The voice announced the complete clear reward I had aimed for.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright!!&quot;</p>

<p>I made a small victory pose.</p>

<p>At the same time, particles of light enveloped me.2</p>

<p>&quot;Cave-type, huh... A little dark, but I can just barely see.&quot;</p>

<p>I open my eyes in the cramped, suffocating space.</p>

<p>I'm surrounded by a stone-enclosed cavern that emits a true &lsquo;dungeon&rsquo; feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why there aren't many people who have completely cleared it so far. As well as being solo, this dungeon might not even have 100 monsters...&quot;</p>

<p>As I continued searching, I could hardly find any more after I surpassed 90.</p>

<p>I sat down in the dungeon, spreading out the water and rice balls I had bought at a convenience store, expecting it to be a long journey.</p>

<p>It was already past 8 PM.</p>

<p>&quot;Only five more to go, let's hang in there a little longer...&quot;</p>

<p>I was quite tired, but the sheer number of 100 was simply a lot.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh!? They're here!!&quot;</p>

<p>Despite my fatigue, I kept searching the dungeon.</p>

<p>Then, I found a group of five Blue Bears near what seemed to be a cave's water edge. Desperate to suppress a cry of joy, I raised my sword and approached the Blue Bears.</p>

<p>By now, I had searched so much that the joy of finding them was greater than that of winning the battles.</p>

<p>&quot;That makes 100!!&quot;</p>

<p>After defeating the 100th Blue Bear, I felt victorious.</p>

<p>By now, I could easily handle 5 vs. 1 as I had figured out their habits.</p>

<p>&#12302;Condition 2 has been achieved.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, they're telling me. How kind.&quot;</p>

<p>The cold, mechanical voice echoed in my head.</p>

<p>The voice that one could here when having cleared a Cube, called by us as heaven&rsquo;s voice. It informed me that I had achieved the second condition of completely clearing the dungeon.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad. If I had miscounted and found out I was one short after defeating the boss, I would've gone mad.&quot;</p>

<p>With a small victory pose, I headed toward the boss's room.</p>

<p>The boss's room was always behind a large door, just like in any other Cube.</p>

<p>I had only seen E-class boss doors firsthand, but I had seen images of other boss doors on the internet.</p>

<p>Grander or rather solemn, they became larger and more ominous as their ranks increased.</p>

<p>I exhaled deeply, replenishing my oxygen.</p>

<p>I wasn't scared, but it was still the boss.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and switched my mindset from the relaxed one I had just moments ago.</p>

<p>The E-class boss, in other words, an opponent on par with a hobgoblin with a broken left hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright!&quot;</p>

<p>I opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>The large square room was dimly lit by torches with blue flames.</p>

<p>In the center was the boss of the Blue Bears.</p>

<p>Its fur was a different shade of blue from the dull-colored Blue Bears - it was sapphire blue, just like the cube itself.</p>

<p>The beautiful color was highly sought after as a material for high-end clothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Sapphire Bear... It's huge. It's even bigger than me.&quot;</p>

<p>The sleeping Sapphire Bear slowly rose to its feet as it noticed my arrival.</p>

<p>It drooled as it stared at me.</p>

<p>I had heard its name before, but this was my first time seeing the jewel-like bear that was both beautiful and powerful.</p>

<p>I readied my High Wolf Fang Sword.</p>

<p>As a C-class monster, the High Wolf was far more powerful.</p>

<p>The Sapphire Bear seemed cautious, perhaps recognizing the weapon made from the material of its superior.</p>

<p>Then, the battle began with the howl of a wolf.</p>

<p>I put everything into it from the start because the third condition was to defeat the boss within a minute.</p>

<p>I had no time to scout it out first.</p>

<p>As we both charged at each other, our paths crossed.</p>

<p>The Sapphire Bear tried to bite me, but I passed downwards.</p>

<p>It went just as I had anticipated.</p>

<p>Having hunted 100 Blue Bears, I had grasped the tricks and habits of their combat.</p>

<p>If there was something they could bite in front of them, they would prioritize biting over slashing.</p>

<p>That's why I didn't dodge head-on until the last moment.</p>

<p>As expected, the Sapphire Bear lunged to bite at my throat.</p>

<p>With limited options, it was easy to dodge the anticipated bite trajectory.</p>

<p>I crouched under the bear's jaw and, combining the force of my legs, I thrust my dagger forcefully from below into its throat.</p>

<p>I then put more force into the embedded sword and pierced through the Sapphire Bear's skull.</p>

<p>Without a chance to cry out, the Sapphire Bear, as if entrusting its weight to me, died.</p>

<p>At that moment, I successfully defeated a boss solo for the first time.</p>

<p>&quot;I did it. I really thought it through and defeated it. Me... unranked me!&quot;</p>

<p>I laid the Sapphire Bear down and wiped the bloodied sword.</p>

<p>After finishing my first boss battle, I felt as if I had grown a little stronger.</p>

<p>That was probably just a matter of mindset.</p>

<p>&#12302;Conditions 1, 2, and 3 confirmed, complete clear reward will be granted.&#12303;</p>

<p>The usual system voice played simultaneously with the boss's defeat.</p>

<p>The voice announced the complete clear reward I had aimed for.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright!!&quot;</p>

<p>I made a small victory pose.</p>

<p>At the same time, particles of light enveloped me.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>&quot;...Oh? I'm back, huh? They won't tell me what the reward is.&quot;</p>

<p>When I open my eyes, I find myself inside the usual cube after defeating the boss.</p>

<p>The sparkling walls of the cube slowly collapse and enter a dormant mode.</p>

<p>&quot;So... Did I really get a reward?&quot;</p>

<p>I stare at the wall and display my status.</p>

<p>Since the remaining magic power is at 0, it seems that, as I expected, the remaining magic power represents how close the dungeon is to collapse.</p>


<p>Remaining Magic Power&#65306;0/50&#65288;+1/24hr&#65289;</p>

<p>Clear Difficulty&#65306;E Rank</p>

<p>&#9670;Reward</p>

<p>First Clear Reward&#65288;Complete&#65289;&#65306;Magic Power +10</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition(s) 1&#12288;While the dungeon hasn&rsquo;t been cleared before, defeat the boss.</p>

<p>Complete Clear Reward&#65288;Complete&#65289;&#65306;Magic Power +30, Class Upgrade Ticket (Beginner)</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;Clear while solo.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 2&#12288;Defeat a 100 or more Blue Bears.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 3&#12288;Defeat the boss within one minute&#12290;</p>


<p>&quot;I'm glad. It seems I got it... I do feel like I've gotten stronger... right? And a Class Upgrade Ticket? Huh? Is it this?&quot;</p>

<p>The full clear reward is +30 magic power.</p>

<p>Also, it seems I received something called a &quot;Class Upgrade Ticket (Beginner).&quot;</p>

<p>As I look around, I find something resembling a bronze-colored ticket at my feet.</p>

<p>I pick up the ticket and examine it.</p>


<p>Type: Item</p>

<p>Title: Class Upgrade Ticket (Beginner)</p>

<p>Attainment Difficulty: C</p>

<p>Effect: A job&rsquo;s class upgrade test will begin once ten tickets are collected.</p>


<p>&quot;Class upgrade test? ...Will this 'no occupation' written on my status change? I thought it was just a derogatory term for being unemployed.&quot;</p>

<p>I stared at my hand and checked my status.</p>


<p>Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: None</p>

<p>Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p>Magic Power: 35</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=9</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=9</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=9</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=9</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>

<p>&#12539;High Wolf&rsquo;s fang sword = Attack Power +120</p>


<p>&quot;......Alright......Yes!&quot;</p>

<p>I look at my own status and make a victory pose with both hands.</p>

<p>My magic power had increased from 5 to 35.</p>

<p>Having more than 10 magic power is the condition for E-Rank.</p>

<p>In other words, I've now evolved from the long-despised unranked title to E-Rank.</p>

<p>&quot;If I keep going like this, I...&quot;</p>

<p>Excited, I wanted to head to the next dungeon.</p>

<p>However, it was already past 8 pm, making it difficult for today.</p>

<p>Thinking that there's no point in rushing, I decide to go home for the day.</p>

<p>I spend another three hours getting back to my rundown apartment.</p>

<p>But my footsteps that day were different from the usual dungeon returns.</p>

<p>I can become stronger.</p>

<p>The top players who I thought were unreachable despite my efforts.</p>

<p>Could I eventually reach those god-like beings?</p>

<p>S-rank, and even further beyond.</p>

<p>I fall asleep with my heart pounding, pondering the potential of the Eye of God and the meaning with which it was granted to me.</p>

<p>-The next day.</p>

<p>I, who am not attending college, would be considered a NEET by society's standards.</p>

<p>I sleep when I want and wake up when I please.</p>

<p>However, today I plan to clear two E-rank dungeons, so I get up at 9 am.</p>

<p>&quot;No fatigue on my body, huh? Well then, let's go!&quot;</p>

<p>I get ready and head to the Cube in the relatively rural area, just like yesterday.</p>

<p>&quot;For now, I guess I'll clear E-Rank dungeons until I collect ten of these Class Upgrade Tickets.&quot;</p>

<p>First, I aim to completely clear ten E-Rank dungeons.</p>

<p>If my intuition is correct, I should be able to get these tickets by fully clearing E-Rank dungeons.</p>

<p>Perhaps others have obtained them before, but they're meaningless without ten, and at a glance, they looked like mere trash, so up until now they have probably been discarded.</p>

<p>However, considering the conditions for a complete clear, I doubt anyone has ever fully cleared a Cube.</p>

<p>Today, while being shaken around, I ride the train and bus again to clear a Cube out in the countryside.</p>

<p>It's because, in the city, there's a higher chance of being seen entering alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there are 100 goblins in this Cube, huh? It might be a hobgoblin, then.&quot;</p>

<p>I stare at the status of the blue Cube.</p>

<p>The condition seems to have only changed from the Blue Bears of the Cube I cleared yesterday to goblins.</p>

<p>Without hesitation, I enter.</p>

<p>Goblins are not to be underestimated.</p>

<p>They're cunning, sly, and lustful towards human women.</p>

<p>Many female adventurers have been captured and brutally violated by them in the past.</p>

<p>This fact has been the greatest fear for female adventurers.</p>

<p>Goblins, and one more thing.</p>

<p>&#12302;Orcs.&#12303;</p>

<p>Such humiliation, which only occurs in fantasy novels and doujinshi, is not something that can be forgiven in reality.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha!&quot;</p>

<p>I exterminate all the goblins.</p>

<p>It felt much easier than when I fought the Blue Bears.</p>

<p>I don't feel much difference in attack power because my weapon is too good, but in terms of agility, it's several times greater.</p>

<p>It's surprising how much lighter my body feels with just that.</p>

<p>And to think that I'm still considered weak as an E-Rank in the eyes of society; I wonder what it feels like to be S-Rank.</p>

<p>It's not unreasonable that some people, overwhelmed by a sense of omnipotence, might mistakenly believe they're invincible and turn to criminal acts.</p>

<p>&#12302;Condition 2 has been achieved.&#12303;</p>

<p> &quot;Huh? Already! Goblins are great! Their numbers are so high that it's not too hard to defeat 100 of them.&quot;</p>

<p>Even so, having to search around the dungeon, the number of 100 is still vast.</p>

<p>I head to the boss room while looking at the map downloaded on my smartphone.</p>

<p>&quot;Now then... I wonder how much I've grown.&quot;</p>

<p>Beyond the opened door.</p>

<p>A hobgoblin, of course, is waiting.</p>

<p>A green demon with the word &ldquo;hob&rdquo; meaning large attached to its name; it&rsquo;s about the same size as me.</p>

<p>&quot;Gyaaa!!&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblin roars.</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while. Let me test my strength. I will&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>And then, I dive into its bosom without any hesitation.</p>

<p>&quot;Gyaa!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;see how much I've grown.&quot;</p>

<p>The hobgoblin, flustered, swings its club down.</p>

<p>I stare intently at the club, avoiding it with minimal movement, not based on intuition but with certainty, without even blinking.</p>

<p>I then swing my sword diagonally, separating the hobgoblin's head from its body.</p>

<p>In one blow.</p>

<p>The hobgoblin dies without even having a chance to scream.</p>

<p>The entire fight, both offense and defense, probably took less than 10 seconds.</p>

<p>It looked like an overwhelming victory.</p>

<p>But that's not the case.</p>

<p>If I had made one wrong move, I would be the one dead.</p>

<p>Still, I was able to win, likely due to the difference in resolve.</p>

<p>Back then, during the trial of strength in the golden Cube,</p>

<p>I was able to make the decision to stake my life.</p>

<p>&quot;...This time, it's my complete victory.&quot;</p>

<p>As a result, I achieved this flawless victory.</p>

<p>Along with my soliloquy, the system voice announces the complete clear.</p>

<p>Then, wrapped in particles of light, I exit the dungeon.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, I got the ticket. It seems like I get this ticket if I completely clear an E-Rank dungeon after all.&quot;</p>

<p>I pick up the ticket at my feet.</p>

<p>The time was just past noon.</p>

<p>I wanted to do one more today, and there should be no problem in terms of time.</p>

<p>I headed straight to the dungeon I had my eye on.</p>

<p>I completely cleared that dungeon without any problems.</p>

<p>As I grow stronger and stronger, I no longer feel threatened by the enemies in E-Rank dungeons.</p>

<p>I cleared two dungeons that day, and two more the next day.</p>

<p>It seemed that clearing two dungeons a day without overdoing it would be just right.</p>

<p>After about four days of repeating this, I had already cleared a total of nine E-rank dungeons.</p>

<p>Only one more dungeon remained for me to clear ten dungeons.</p>

<p>I had also gathered nine Class Upgrade Tickets, and I was just one ticket away from having ten.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, this is the last one. After this, I'll try using the Class Upgrade Tickets. I'm curious about what the promotion exam is like...&quot;</p>

<p>The time was dusk.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and it was a beautiful time with the orange sky.</p>

<p>As I was troubled about whether to use the Class Upgrade Tickets once I gathered the target amount, I arrived at the deserted station.</p>

<p>At the station, where it seemed like one could ride without paying a fare as there were no staff, I got off.</p>

<p>Looking around, the only thing blocking my view was the mountains.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew there was an E-Rank cube in this village from the guild's information, but the location wasn't written... Should I ask the villagers?&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, the details of this village's cube were not listed on the guild's clearers-only website.</p>

<p>Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the village was a basin, completely cut off from the outside world.</p>

<p>It was an unbelievable sight for a city-dweller like me, as if this village was the only one left behind in the world.</p>

<p>The roofs were not made of wood, but were thatched, and children in short sleeves and shorts played in the river.</p>

<p>It was a nostalgic scenery that would likely be the first to come up if one searched for the countryside.</p>

<p>&#12302;Yonaki Village&#12303;*Night-Cry Village*</p>

<p> That's what it was called on the map, but the name held a slightly eerie atmosphere.</p>

<p>It seemed like they might offer sacrifices; I apologize for my prejudice.</p>

<p>As I was looking at the map posted at the station, I was suddenly spoken to.</p>

<p>I instinctively tensed up due to habit, but there was...</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!! Are you, by any chance, a clearer!?&quot;</p>

<p>A girl in a school uniform was waving her hand.</p>

<h2>Translator Notes:</h2>

<p>&quot;Yonaki Village&quot; = &#22812;&#40180;&#26449; &#22812;= Night &#40180;= Cry of an animal &#26449;=Village</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>&quot;Ha, hai?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly spoken to, I become suspicious in my behavior.</p>

<p>About middle school age? She is about the same height as Nagi and has a similar atmosphere somehow.</p>

<p>Is it the lack of makeup and a simple feel? If I had to put it negatively, she's not polished.</p>

<p>Her appearance overlaps a little with Nagi, who is always sleeping at home and doesn't know about makeup.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I-I'm sorry. I'm Imai Nagisa from Yonaki Village.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Imai-san... Nice... to meet you. So, what's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>I ask why she suddenly started talking to me.</p>

<p>I don't think she's found out, but I'm breaking the rules by clearing the Cube alone.</p>

<p>A little bit of guilt accelerates my heartbeat.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, right. I contacted you, but... can you check the situation for now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Situation?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the Cube!&quot;</p>

<p>I thought there was a misunderstanding between us, but Imai-san started walking briskly, so I decided to follow her.</p>

<p>I didn't know the location of the Cube in this village so it's convenient if she leads me to it. Therefore, while not really swallowing the situation, I follow her.</p>

<p>Imai-san walks straight ahead at a brisk pace.</p>

<p>Looking at her back, I can't help but murmur.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nagi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, no, it's nothing!&quot;</p>

<p>Her build, height, and hairstyle.</p>

<p>Everything about Imai-san resembles Nagi, even their names, Nagisa and Nagi, are similar.</p>

<p>Their faces aren't alike, but the makeup-free, simple feel is similar.</p>

<p>But Nagi is the cutest in the world with her just being herself, so that's different, I guess.</p>

<p>However, looking at her from the back, they are so similar that I feel like I can imagine what Nagi would look like if she had grown up healthy and went to middle school.</p>

<p>Feeling a bit sentimental looking at her back, I hope that Nagi will also wear a uniform and walk energetically one day.</p>

<p>For that, I absolutely have to find a cure with this Eye of God.</p>

<p>I continue following her.</p>

<p>Then, I guess it's the center of the village, where there's a big building and villagers gathered around it.</p>

<p>About 50 people, is there some kind of festival going on?</p>

<p>People gather around a square box-shaped building.</p>

<p>It's like a Cube, but it looks like a prefab hut.</p>

<p>As I stare at the building, an old man spots me and starts yelling.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagisa! You!!&quot;</p>

<p>He looks like a farmer's grandfather, stubborn if I had to put it negatively.</p>

<p>Many villagers look at me, prompted by him.</p>

<p>I don't feel welcomed at all.</p>

<p>Rather.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but... we should call a professional!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Idiot! The village will solve the village's problems! That's the tradition, and that's what we decided!!&quot;</p>

<p>Then the old man walks up to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Outsider, go home. This is our village. Thieves. You came to take advantage of us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ha?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm suddenly insulted, but one after another, other villagers hurl abusive words at me and tell me to leave.</p>

<p>I don't understand why I have to be insulted like this, but it's starting to get on my nerves.</p>

<p>Moreover, it's not just me, but Imai-san is also being blamed terribly; I don't know why, but it's pitiful.</p>

<p>&quot;But...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nagisa, you stop this nonsense!!&quot;</p>

<p>The old man raises his fist at Imai-san with an intense expression. Imai-san closed her eyes with a tearful face.</p>

<p>However, that fist never hurt Imai-san.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't really understand, but if it's my fault, then please lower your fist. I'll leave.&quot;</p>

<p>I caught the old man's fist.</p>

<p>Even though he's an old man, he's an Awakened.</p>

<p>If he had a high rank, Imai-san could be injured.</p>

<p>But I had seen their statuses - the old man is E-Rank and Imai-san is D-Rank, so there shouldn't be any problem.</p>

<p>&quot;Outsiders... should stay out of this!&quot;</p>

<p>The old man forcibly shook off my arm. Not really understanding, I told Imai-san I would leave and started to back away.</p>

<p>I then headed straight for the train station. The Cube here was a shame, but the atmosphere didn't seem like one where it could be cleared. There are plenty of other Cubes, so I decided to clear another location.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, excuse me!&quot;</p>

<p>Imai-san came running after me and called out to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really sorry. And thank you for helping me earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's fine. Can I ask what happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well,&quot;</p>

<p>Imai-san explained the situation to me.</p>

<p>The Cube in this village had been thinned out by the village chief's grandchild, an Awakened, who lived in the village.</p>

<p>However, that Awakened person had been invited to join an overseas guild and was now in America.</p>

<p>The village chief had a falling out with the person and stubbornly refused any outside help. That old man was the village chief.</p>

<p>Moreover, the dungeon's collapse could happen any moment now, so the village was going to take down the dungeon boss.</p>

<p>&quot;It's hard to believe that there's such a closed-off village in Japan these days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, I contacted the Dungeon Association, but... they said I should ask the representative of the local government... but I'm glad you came!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...&quot;</p>

<p>I looked away with a slight feeling of guilt.</p>

<p>The Dungeon Association, by default, manages the Cubes.</p>

<p>However, they can't keep track of all the new Cubes that suddenly fall from the sky, so the local government of the area where the Cube is found has to report it.</p>

<p>&quot;But looking at the way they were...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... I know it's a very rude request, but please help us! I may need some time to prepare the money, but I&rsquo;ll definitely pay! Please!&quot;</p>

<p>Imai-san desperately bowed her head and called out to me. I wondered why she would go to such lengths even after being treated like that.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you go that far, even after what they did to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Please. The people of this village are precious to me. That's why... please help. Please.&quot;</p>

<p>I was troubled by her desperate attitude, wondering what to do.</p>

<p>But when someone begs me so desperately, I can't help but feel weak.</p>

<p>Especially when it's a girl who looks so much like Nagi, even more so.</p>

<p>I guess you could say I'm too kind-hearted.</p>

<p>But there was a time when I resented the fact that someone with the power to help wouldn't help someone in need.</p>

<p>There were also selfish moments when I wanted someone to help me.</p>

<p>I remember feeling angry, thinking that if it were me, I would definitely lend a hand.</p>

<p>Then the answer was already decided.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. I'll stay in the village today and tomorrow. If anything happens, I should be able to handle it.&quot;</p>

<p>(If it's an E-class dungeon, I should be fine even if something happens.)</p>

<p>&quot;R-really!? Thank you so much! Please stay at my house tonight! My grandmother and I live at the edge of the village.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Well, I guess I'll take you up on that offer since it'll be easier to help if something happens.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's settled! Oh, what should I call you...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'm Amachi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood, nice to meet you, Amachi-san.&quot;</p>

<p>I headed to the thatched-roof house at the edge of the village.</p>

<p>&quot;Grandma! We have a guest staying with us tonight!&quot;</p>

<p>As soon as Imai-san entered the house, she called for her grandmother.</p>

<p>An elderly woman, probably in her 80s, came out, leaning on a cane and holding her hip.</p>

<p>I was slightly cautious, but she seemed to be a kind old lady with no issues.</p>

<p>&quot;It's rare for an outsider to visit our village. Are you Nagisa&rsquo;s boyfriend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-no, I'm not!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then it must be one of those dating apps, like Tinder or what&rsquo;s its name. Well, I'll go outside for a while, so feel free to have fun. But remember one thing, use contraception.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;G-grandma! Don't say such weird things!&quot;</p>

<p>Imai-san hurriedly covers her grandmother's mouth.</p>

<p>Although she seemed like a typical countryside grandma, her personality was completely different.</p>

<p>She's quite a mischievous old lady.</p>

<p>&quot;S-sorry, Amachi-san. My grandma loves to joke around.&quot;</p>

<p>Imai-san apologizes to me.</p>

<p>Behind her, the grandmother cheerfully makes a peace sign and grins, showing her dentures. She's an incredibly energetic and lively old lady.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice to meet you, I'm Amachi. I'm a clearer called here by Imai... I mean, Nagisa-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, I see, welcome. Let's have a meal then. Thank you for coming all this way. It's not much of a place, but please make yourself comfortable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, thank you for having me.&quot;</p>

<p>I then step inside the house and head to the living room as guided.</p>

<p>Wow, an irori hearth, this is my first time seeing one.</p>

<p>I sat down cross-legged in the room I was shown to.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything I can help with?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, you're our guest, just sit and relax. Nagisa, let's make hot pot today. Let's use that meat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Understood&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>As I sat in the room, the preparations for the hot pot progressed quickly. What kind of meat is this? It doesn't seem to be beef or pork, but it looks delicious.</p>

<p>The irori hearth was lit, and the pot was hung over it.</p>

<p>Wild vegetables and meat were added one after another, filling the room with a delicious aroma.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let's eat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's dig in!&quot;</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the hot pot. The rice was also incredibly delicious, as expected from a countryside filled with rice paddies.</p>

<p>&quot;How is it? Tastes good, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's amazing! What kind of meat is this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's human flesh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the medicine should start taking effect soon&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Certainly, the grandmother looked at me laughed.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p>In an instant, the blood drained from my face.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but feel a slight numbness in my body. Could it be that this meat is from a previous guest who came to this village before me?</p>

<p>&quot;Just kidding.&quot;</p>

<p>Just kidding?!</p>

<p>&quot;Grandma! The name of this village is scary enough! Don't make jokes like that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha! Sorry, sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha...&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, I thought about the meaning of the name Yonaki Village.</p>

<p>As if the village doesn't already have an image of sacrifice and customs.</p>

<p>&quot;But, you seem young too, and you're doing great as a clearer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I still have a long way to go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Risking your life to protect someone. There's nothing more noble than that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, be proud. Right, Nagisa?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I think you're really amazing. Fighting against monsters&#8230; I couldn't&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa's expression darkened slightly.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Grandma quickly changed the topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Amachi-san, it's already midnight, so how about taking a bath? Which do you prefer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by 'which'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, do you want to soak in my granddaughter's used bathwater or do you want her to soak in yours--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Grandma! Amachi-san, please go ahead and take a bath first. I don't mind. Actually, I'd prefer not to have you experience my used bathwater&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I won't 'experience' it!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, just kidding. I'll go prepare it!&quot;</p>

<p>With that, Nagisa hurried off.</p>

<p>Grandma seemed quite responsible for her granddaughter. Speaking of which, where are her parents?</p>

<p>With a slight curiosity, I went to take a bath.</p>

<p>The rural bath that was prepared was hotter than my usual bath.</p>

<p>Instead of hot water that flows at the push of a button in the city, this bath was heated with fire, so adjusting the temperature seemed difficult.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, just preparing the bath was quite a task; I could feel the power of modern civilization.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, it was refreshing. Huh? Where's Nagisa?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She went to the village chief's place. I told her it would be useless trying to convince that stubborn old man, but&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a reason why Nagisa is so desperate about this, Grandma? It doesn't seem normal&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;Well, since you've come this far&#8230; I have nothing to hide. I'll tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing the change in Grandma's attitude from her earlier teasing, I sat down, realizing it was a serious topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Her father and mother&#8230; they died in a dungeon collapse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It happened when she could barely walk. My son, her father, got a job outside the village&#8230; and then&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>The story that followed was not something a grade schooler could fully comprehend.</p>

<p>It was not long ago when dungeon collapses occurred more frequently than now.</p>

<p>Japan, no, the entire world, was in chaos, and legal provisions couldn't keep up.</p>

<p>That's when the Dungeon Association, a global organization, was established.</p>

<p>Built upon numerous sacrifices, it became the world's largest organization, encompassing both politics and economics.</p>

<p>Thanks to its efforts, dungeon collapses decreased significantly worldwide, and the number of victims also dropped.</p>

<p>However, dungeon collapses still occur today, and victims remain.</p>

<p>&quot;I see&#8230; that's&#8230; she went through painful experience.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I took her in, it was terrible. But she's finally able to laugh again. It's all thanks to me desperately honing my gag skills&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>(Well, I wonder about that&#8230;)</p>

<p>I learned about the slightly sad circumstances of the ever-joking grandma.</p>

<p>Putting aside whether her jokes are funny, she must have been trying her best to make Nagisa laugh.</p>

<p>Thanks to her efforts, Nagisa can smile like anyone else.</p>

<p>But knowing that reason, I could understand why she's so afraid of dungeon collapses.</p>

<p>&quot;Please take your time and relax. Would you like me to turn on the TV?&quot;</p>

<p>With that, Grandma turned on the TV and left the room.</p>

<p>The news was on.</p>

<p>&quot;Another act of terrorism by the God Slayer Cult&#8230; Overseas is really scary&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>I listened to the TV while enjoying the liberating feeling of the open veranda.</p>

<p>On TV, news of another large-scale terrorist attack by awakened individuals played.</p>

<p>It had sadly become a part of daily life.</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while since I've been able to relax like this...&quot;</p>

<p>I gazed at the moon, feeling a little gloomy as I thought about Nagisa's past.</p>

<p>The sky, devoid of the city lights, was beautiful, and only the moonlight illuminated the quiet village.</p>

<p>That night was a night too quiet for Yonaki Village.</p>

<p>&#9671; Going back in time a bit, Yonaki Village Chief's residence.</p>

<p>&quot;I think we should move the plan up and execute it tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>Village Chief Furukawa had gathered a group of young men at his home.</p>

<p>They were all D-Rank awakened individuals, about five in total.</p>

<p>These were the highest-ranking awakened individuals in the village.</p>

<p>Since humanity's awakening, almost half of the population is E-Rank, and the remaining half is D-Rank. Only the top 1% are C-Rank, while 0.1% are B-Rank.</p>

<p>When it comes to A-Rank, there are only a few hundred in Japan, with a population of over 100 million.</p>

<p>There are so few S-Rank individuals that you can count them on one hand.</p>

<p>That was the power balance in the country.</p>

<p>As a result, many start to work as clearers starting from D-Rank, while E-Rank pursue other professions.</p>

<p>There are those in E-Rank who aim to be clearers, but they are a minority.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, there was a formidable individual in Yonaki Village who could clear dungeons alone.</p>

<p>However, the village chief's grandson had gone to an overseas guild due to his strength and was no longer around.</p>

<p>So, Village Chief Furukawa gathered five young D-Rank men.</p>

<p>&quot;Furukawa-san, are you really okay with us splitting all the dungeon rewards among ourselves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, if you defeat the boss, it'll be worth a million yen. You guys are lucky; this happens every month. Let's go on a luxury trip with that money next time, how about a soapland in Tokyo?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, that's amazing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's definitely go, Furukawa-san!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while since I've been to Tokyo, the city is full of beautiful women. I'm getting excited.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Dungeon Association's rules state that a D-Rank dungeon can be cleared safely with five D-Rank individuals. So, I'm counting on you guys!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood!&quot;</p>

<p>The dungeon in Yonaki Village is considered E-Rank by the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>However, this was a false report made by the village chief, Furukawa.</p>

<p>Since E-Rank dungeons don't yield significant resources and their collapse wouldn't cause much trouble, the Dungeon Association deems them low-priority.</p>

<p>This is because local governments can handle such low-level dungeons.</p>

<p>That's why Furukawa falsely reported the D-Rank dungeon as E-Rank, fattening his own pockets with the resources obtained from the dungeon.</p>

<p>(Truth is, I don't want to share with these guys... but my idiot grandson went off to America.)</p>

<p>&quot;Today, someone from the Association came by. They might snatch our rewards tomorrow, or even find out our secret. That's why we need to execute the plan tonight, without their help. Are ya&rsquo;ll ready?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fully prepared!&quot;</p>

<p>Furukawa and his group decided to clear the dungeon that night, instead of the originally planned next day.</p>

<p>This was because, inadvertently, they feared being exposed to the Dungeon Association due to the appearance of Kai.</p>

<p>The young men and Furukawa went to the square building in the center of Yonaki Village that Kai saw earlier.</p>

<p>Inside that building was a Cube.</p>

<p>The prefabricated hut-like building surrounding the Cube was built to hide its existence from outsiders.</p>

<p>In reality, the cube was in the center of Yonaki Village, surrounded by houses.</p>

<p>This would typically be very dangerous, but there had never been a dungeon collapse.</p>

<p>This was because the village chief's grandson, who had now joined an overseas guild, had been controlling the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, do your best!&quot;</p>

<p>The time was already past midnight.</p>

<p>It was around the same time that Kai was having a meal at the Imai household.</p>

<p>Furukawa sent off the young men, patting their backs and reminding them to be sure to collect the magic stones.</p>

<p>Armed with cheap swords and equipment, they set off to clear the dungeon without even a map.</p>

<p>Optimistically, they entered the dungeon as if they were going on a field trip.</p>

<p>However, they were unaware that the dungeon point system is designed for qualified clearers who have received proper training, have their equipment in order, and are entering an already explored dungeon with a map they completely understand.</p>

<p>It's not a system that amateurs can easily adapt to.</p>

<p>And they didn't know that there were lower and upper tiers - ranks within the D-Rank dungeons.</p>

<p>~ Two hours later.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, this is boring...&quot;</p>

<p>Furukawa was sitting in the makeshift building surrounding the cube, waiting for good news from the others.</p>

<p>About two hours had passed, and he recalled that his grandson usually cleared the dungeon within an hour.</p>

<p>However, he was aware that that was a special case and that it generally took about 2-3 hours to completely clear.</p>

<p>Then, a girl came running.</p>

<p>&quot;Huff, huff... So you were here, Furukawa-san! ...Don't tell me, they've already gone in!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What is it, Nagisa? You've really caused me a lot of trouble. But well, it was all in vain. It's over now. We can protect the village on our own, without the help of that Dungeon Association.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa stared at the cube inside the building, just like Furukawa.</p>

<p>Bububu</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa saw the Cube trembling slightly.</p>

<p>The blood drained from her face in an instant.</p>

<p>She thought she might have seen it wrong, but the cube was indeed vibrating subtly.</p>

<p>And she knew this phenomenon, her voice failing due to the fear that surfaced as soon as she remembered it.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? Have they come back? Did it feel like this when they came back? I think the Cube was about to open or something...&quot;</p>

<p>It was just as Furukawa stood up and reached out to touch the white cube in front of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Ru...run...&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa mustered her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? What are you--!?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, the Cube, which had been vibrating subtly, began to tremble violently before their eyes.</p>

<p>It made a metallic sound, almost like a scream.</p>

<p>The vivid white color of the Cube, representing the D-Rank dungeon, inverted and turned into a pitch-black cube.</p>

<p>From the Cube, something rolled out.</p>

<p>It was a head.</p>

<p>One of the young men from the D-Rank group that Furukawa had sent out appeared in a horrifying state.</p>

<p>Furukawa was dumbfounded and unable to speak, but...</p>

<p>&ldquo;AH!?&rdquo;</p>

<p> Furukawa&rsquo;s face was suddenly grabbed by a thick arm extending from the Cube, about the size of a woman's waist.</p>

<p>Lifted by that arm, Furukawa desperately struggled to escape, but the hand held tight and eventually crushed him, putting an end to his life.</p>

<p>&quot;N-no...no...&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa, covered in Furukawa's blood, backed away.</p>

<p>One after another, monsters emerged from the Cube.</p>

<p>With grotesque bodies and hideous faces, these monsters had huge, bear-like physiques and pig-like faces covered in thick layers of fat.</p>

<p>Despite their appearance, they possessed a minimum level of intelligence.</p>

<p>&#12302;Orcs&#12303;</p>

<p>While being D-Rank monsters, they were close to C-Rank in terms of power.</p>

<p>In lower-level dungeons, they were the most feared enemy of all humanity and the archenemy of women.</p>

<p>The monsters grinned as they looked at Nagisa, and one of the orcs grabbed her as she trembled, unable to move.</p>

<p>Nagisa tried desperately to resist, but her strength failed her.</p>

<p>Then, she was carried away into the dungeon and disappeared.</p>

<p>The remaining orcs roared and smashed the makeshift building.</p>

<p>The noise lit up the entire village.</p>

<p>Soon after, they were consumed by despair and terror.</p>

<p>That day, the D-Rank dungeon in Yonaki Village collapsed in the worst possible way.</p>

<p>The pig-like monsters rampaged through the remote village, where no one could save them, trampling and devouring everything in their path.</p>

<p>Only screams echoed in the quiet night, as if to embody the name of Yonaki Village.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>&quot;......It's getting noisy, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>As I was spacing out on the veranda, looking at the moon, the lights in the village started to turn on. But since this is on the outskirts of the village, I can't really tell what's happening.</p>

<p>&quot;It's rare for the lights to be on at this time, since it's mostly elderly people here. They all go to bed by 9 o'clock...&quot;</p>

<p>As she said that, the old lady pulled out her smartphone.</p>

<p>Huh? Smartphone? She can use it? The feeling of incongruity is intense.</p>

<p>Then the old lady skillfully used FaceID and operated the smartphone with one hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Haha. It's easy, this much. Let's see... the village's SNS...&quot;</p>

<p>So there's even a village SNS, they're really making use of civilization.</p>

<p>Despite my prejudice thinking they were still using rotary phones; it was actually quite modern.</p>

<p>&quot;......A pig monster has appeared...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the village again.</p>

<p>The once bright village was soon engulfed in flames, illuminating the dark night sky.</p>

<p>A pig monster... only one thing comes to mind.</p>

<p>And if that has appeared, it means...</p>

<p>&quot;It seems a dungeon collapse has occurred... huh? Amachi-san?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I ran with all my might.</p>

<p>If a dungeon collapse is happening, Nagisa-san is in danger.</p>

<p>Most of the people in this village are strangers, some have even been abusive.</p>

<p>I don't feel enough attachment to save them.</p>

<p>But Nagisa-san is different.</p>

<p>I already see her as my own sister.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it! Make it in time!!&quot;</p>

<p>My impatience spurs me on.</p>

<p>A pig monster, probably an orc.</p>

<p>Moreover, orcs are D-Rank monsters, but their threat level is almost C-Rank.</p>

<p>It's because they have high intelligence and often act in groups.</p>

<p>They were also called the worst D-Rank monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;Hah hah hah... ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>When I arrived at the village, it was full of orcs.</p>

<p>There must be about 20 of them, the villagers desperately fought back, but those who were not D-Rank awakened couldn't even be a match.</p>

<p>Most of the people in this village are probably E-Rank, and there were already victims.</p>

<p>&quot;Help... Please help me!&quot;</p>

<p>I ran towards the sound of that voice.</p>

<p>There, an orc was attacking an old lady.</p>

<p>With an ugly body, a pig's nose, a body as big as a bear, and holding not a club but an ax-like thing made of stone and wood.</p>

<p>I checked the status of that orc.</p>


<p>Name: Orc</p>

<p>Magic Power: 70</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;30%=21</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;20%=14</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;10%=7</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;40%=28</p>


<p>&quot;It's strong... incomparably stronger than a Blue Bear.&quot;</p>

<p>The orc's magic power was 70, truly an upper-class D-Rank.</p>

<p>I could see why it was said to be the strongest species among the monsters in a D-Rank Cube. In that case, not as an individual, but as a group.</p>

<p>I drew the sword from my waist and took a stance.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn't have been a match for it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ngo!?&quot;</p>

<p>If I was the same as before.</p>

<p>I cut off the orc's head with a single blow from behind.</p>

<p>My status, having completely cleared nine Cubes, had skyrocketed compared to before.</p>

<p>I stared at my own hand, as if to take in this new strength.</p>


<p>Name: Kai Amachi</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: None</p>

<p>Skill(s): The Eye of God, Access Permission Lv1</p>

<p>Magic Power: 285</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=71</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=71</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=71</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;25%=71</p>

<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;The Emblem of the Knight</p>

<p>&#12539;High Wolf&rsquo;s fang sword = Attack Power +120</p>


<p>Upon fully clearing an E-Rank cube, my magical power had increased by an average of about 30.</p>

<p>Having cleared nine of them, my magical power has now grown to nearly 300.</p>

<p>With my current strength, I might be able to solo a D-Rank dungeon.</p>

<p>The magical power of C-Rank clearers is, according to the association's regulations, around 100 to 1000, so I should now be considered a lower-class C-Rank.</p>

<p>However, soloing a dungeon with orcs is still not very reassuring.</p>

<p>Once I've defeated all the orcs here, I'll request reinforcements from the association.</p>

<p>Various things might be exposed, but that's a secondary concern.</p>

<p>With that decision, I hunted down all the orcs in the village.</p>

<p>The 20 or so orcs were rampaging separately, and I was able to defeat them without much trouble when they were on their own.</p>

<p>The reason these guys are troublesome is their intelligence, which allows them to form groups, but in this situation, they're just D-Rank monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;Do any of you know where Nagisa-san is?&quot;</p>

<p>I asked the people in the village whom I had saved.</p>

<p>However, nobody could answer, and they seemed to be agitated from fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are you... Nagisa?&quot;</p>

<p>I searched around the village. But she was nowhere to be found, and I had already wiped out all the orcs.</p>

<p>I arrived at the center of the village.</p>

<p>&quot;...Dungeon collapse, a black Cube... was it inside this building?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a prefab cabin that was broken and in shambles.</p>

<p>A pitch-black Cube was peeking out from inside it.</p>


<p>Remaining magic power&#65306;100/100&#65288;+1/24hr&#65289;</p>

<p>&#8251;Dungeon Collapse Occurring</p>

<p>Clear Difficulty&#65306;D-Rank</p>

<p>&#9670;Reward</p>

<p>First Clear Reward&#65288;Complete&#65289;&#65306;Magic Power +50</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition(s) 1&#12288;Before the dungeon has been cleared for the first time, defeat the boss.</p>

<p>Complete Clear Reward (Incomplete)&#65306;Current access level is unable to display this.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;Clear solo.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 2&#12288;Defeat a 50 or more orcs.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 3&#12288;Defeat the boss within five minute(s)&#12290;</p>


<p>&quot;D-Rank... so they really did submit a false report.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked at the Cube's status.</p>

<p>Normally, it would be pitch-black, and I wouldn't be able to tell its rank, but that didn't matter to me, who could see its status.</p>

<p>Then I entered the building, frowning.</p>

<p>That's because there was a man's head and, probably, the village chief's dead body inside.</p>

<p>&quot;They tried to clear it on their own and failed... They should have just left it to the association, but for money's sake, I guess...&quot;</p>

<p>I looked around, and then I saw:</p>

<p>&quot;Are these Nagisa-san's shoes?&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa-san was wearing her school uniform.</p>

<p>It seemed like she had just left them there, as there were two leather shoes lying near the cube.</p>

<p>One was right next to the village chief's dead body, and the other one was...</p>

<p>&quot;Don't tell me... she was taken!?&quot;</p>

<p>It was lying right next to the Cube, as if she had desperately resisted being taken inside.</p>

<p>Orcs eat human males and assault females.</p>

<p>That's why they were considerably feared monsters.</p>

<p>&quot;...Damn it!&quot;</p>

<p>I made a fist and yelled out loud.</p>

<p>I sent Tanaka-san a message saying that a D-Rank dungeon collapse had occurred in Yonaki Village and to please help.</p>

<p>However, it would probably take at least an hour or two, even if they were quick.</p>

<p>During that time, Nagisa-san might be at the mercy of the orcs.</p>

<p>Without any hesitation, I took a step forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait for me, Nagisa...&quot;</p>

<p>Just like I would say to my little sister.</p>

<p>I made up my mind and touched the black Cube.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual dignified sound, black lightning ran through it as if rejecting me, crackling. I felt like I was being resisted, but I forced myself into the Cube, putting all my strength into my foot.</p>

<p>Even if there were a hundred orcs in there.</p>

<p>Even if there was a risk to my life.</p>

<p>Because I didn't want to feel that way anymore.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll definitely save you.&quot;</p>

<p>I plunged into that unknown dungeon.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>&quot;Is this also a cave-type dungeon...? Is it because the dungeon has collapsed? It has a strange atmosphere.&quot;</p>

<p>It feels a bit more suffocating than the usual dungeons.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's just my imagination or how I'm feeling, but the air feels heavy and stifling. The pressure weighs down on me more than it does in a regular dungeon.</p>

<p>And then, right in front of me...</p>

<p>&quot;...Of course, they're here.&quot;</p>

<p>The moment I entered; a group of orcs was there.</p>

<p>They didn't seem to have noticed me yet, but there were five of them, each with 70 magical power.</p>

<p>In total, their combined magical power was equivalent to 350, easily surpassing mine.</p>

<p>So, without hesitation, I ambushed one of them, leaping from behind and decapitating it. Another one, though surprised, barely managed to raise its weapon, leading to a brief clash. However, I managed to overpower it with the superiority of my weapon.</p>

<p>In an instant, I successfully killed two of the orcs.</p>

<p>But the remaining three, naturally, readied their weapons.</p>

<p>From here on, it's not an ambush but a head-on battle, and a tough fight is inevitable.</p>

<p>I can't let my guard down, but there's no time to waste.</p>

<p>I take a slightly risky gamble.</p>

<p>With a razor-thin margin, I dodged and slashed the three orcs.</p>

<p>Although I took some hits, the difference in our stats meant I only suffered minor bruises, which was fortunate.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew... I think I can manage this. Good thing I've grown to a certain extent.&quot;</p>

<p>I continued running, staying cautious and trying to minimize the noise.</p>

<p>When I found orcs, I would primarily kill them by ambushing, or if there were multiple, I would lure them out and kill them one by one.</p>

<p>I pressed forward through the dungeon head-on.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagisa... where are you...?&quot;</p>

<p>I had already killed more than 20 orcs.</p>

<p>Yet, there was no sign of Nagisa. I searched for her.</p>

<p>Perhaps because I was in a rush, I didn't even have the presence of mind to add the honorific &quot;san&quot; to her name, calling her without it.</p>

<p>The fact that her name was similar to my sister Nagi might be part of the reason, but honestly, it didn't matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it! This is the path I came from. She's not here!&quot;</p>

<p>There was no map of this dungeon, as the village chief had kept it hidden.</p>

<p>Because of that, the clear wasn't going smoothly.</p>

<p>However, after about an hour of running around, I found the boss's room.</p>

<p>A door that was one size larger and more ominous compared to the E-Rank door.</p>

<p>&quot;...Is this the boss's room? This is the end.&quot;</p>

<p>But I still ran at full speed to search the unexplored areas.</p>

<p>At least, if I could hear her voice somewhere...</p>

<p>&quot;Please, be safe.&quot;</p>

<p>&#9671;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...UuUu&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deep within the dungeon...</p>

<p>There, Nagisa was captured.</p>

<p>She had been taken to a small room-like area within the cave.</p>

<p>Surrounded by stone walls on all sides, there was only one entrance and exit.</p>

<p>And there, standing like guards, were three orcs.</p>

<p>&quot;No... I don't want this...&quot;</p>

<p>Trembling, Nagisa curled up, hugging herself with both arms.</p>

<p>She was scared.</p>

<p>Would she be killed like the village chief?</p>

<p>And like her parents back then?</p>

<p>Her memories were still vague and faint, but just remembering that day made her tremble uncontrollably.</p>

<p>&quot;Mom, Dad... help me...&quot;</p>

<p>She had heard that among monsters, there were those who would brutally assault women, forcibly violate them, and when they grew bored, devour them.</p>

<p>Orcs and goblins were among those species.</p>

<p>Just imagining it made her want to end her life right now.</p>

<p>If she had to experience such terror, she would rather it all end here.</p>

<p>Fear gripped Nagisa so much that her tears wouldn't stop.</p>

<p>Yet, without the courage to do anything, Nagisa could only tremble and stare at her own fate.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehehe...&quot;</p>

<p>An orc at the entrance drooled as it looked at Nagisa.</p>

<p>Reaching out, it grabbed her with its thick arm.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no!!&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa, who possessed the same D-Rank magical power as the orcs, tried to shake off the orc's grip and escape with all her strength.</p>

<p>The orc grimaced at her resistance, and its fellow guards entered the room one after another.</p>

<p>Nagisa was forcibly restrained by the three orcs.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no... help me... help meee!!&quot;</p>

<p>With her last ounce of strength, she screamed for help, even though she knew it was meaningless.</p>

<p>The orcs seemed to be excited by her voice, shaking their bodies. Nagisa desperately resisted, pushing the orcs away and screaming.</p>

<p>Her last stand, she cried out for help with a loud voice. It might be futile, but she wanted to be saved.</p>

<p>&quot;Someone!! Help me!! Help meee!!&quot;</p>

<p>Deep within this Cube...</p>

<p>There should be no one there, but just maybe.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagisaaaaa!!!&quot;</p>

<p>There might be someone who wouldn't miss that voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>The grip on Nagisa's arm weakened.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward, one of the orc's heads fell.</p>

<p>The remaining two orcs turned around, wondering what had happened.</p>

<p>But in that instant, another head fell.</p>

<p>&quot;Gaaaaa!!&quot;</p>

<p>The last remaining orc howled, not understanding what was going on.</p>

<p>However, a sword pierced its head from the jaw to the brain, ending its life.</p>

<p>It all happened in an instant.</p>

<p>Nagisa couldn't even understand what had happened.</p>

<p>But one thing she knew for sure.</p>

<p> &quot;...Thank goodness. It's alright now. I'll save you.&quot;</p>

<p>She knew that someone had come to help her.</p>

<p>Kai crouched down and gently stroked the sobbing Nagisa's head, just like he would do for his little sister when she was scared and on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>&quot;It's going to be okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa immediately burst into tears and clung to Kai while crying loudly.</p>

<p>&quot;Waah, it was so scary!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's alright now, big brother is going to protect you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Big brother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...My apologies. Please forget I said that.&quot;</p>

<p>I accidentally called myself her big brother, just like I would with Nagi.</p>

<p>To hide my embarrassment, I lifted Nagisa up in my arms.</p>

<p>&#12302;Condition 2 has been achieved.&#12303;</p>

<p>(That makes 50 now, huh? I defeated quite a few... I wasn't counting because I was so focused.)</p>

<p>&quot;You're not wearing shoes, so please bear with it for a bit. I&rsquo;ll defeat the boss and get out of here quickly. Otherwise...&quot;</p>

<p>I carried Nagisa in a princess hold and immediately headed outside.</p>

<p>A large number of orcs were running towards us, targeting me&mdash;there must have been at least 20.</p>

<p>When I heard Nagisa's voice, I ignored all the orcs and ran towards her without defeating them.</p>

<p>As a result, many orcs were chasing after me.</p>

<p>&quot;Gumomoooo!!&quot;</p>

<p>I ran with all my might.</p>

<p>My destination was the room with the boss's door.</p>

<p>I remembered the way, so I wouldn't get lost.</p>

<p>It would have been better if I could have left through the entrance of the cube, but a large army of orcs was in that direction. Facing that many of them would be harder than dealing with the boss.</p>

<p>&quot;A- Amachi-san... Amachi-san...&quot;</p>

<p>Nagisa gripped me with her trembling hand.</p>

<p>She must have been truly terrified. I held her tightly to reassure her. It's not unreasonable for her to be scared, considering she's still in middle school.</p>

<p>&quot;Nagisa, I'm going to defeat the boss now. I'll have to leave you alone for a bit... Can you manage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?... Y-yes, I'll do my best.&quot;</p>

<p>While carrying her in a princess hold, I asked Nagisa for her cooperation.</p>

<p>Her face turned slightly red.</p>

<p>With tearful eyes, a flushed face, and unable to meet my gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, we're here.&quot;</p>

<p>We arrived in front of the boss's room while still holding Nagisa. A large number of orcs were making a roaring sound as they chased us from behind.</p>

<p>Even though I had defeated 50 of them, which should have been enough for a complete clear, there were still more.</p>

<p>I opened the door to the boss's room. Nagisa and I entered, and the door closed behind us, signaling that the battle with the boss was about to begin.</p>

<p>&quot;A white orc... It looks strong, but...&quot;</p>

<p>I checked the orc's status.</p>


<p>Name: White Orc</p>

<p>Magic Power: 100</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654;30%=30</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654;20%=20</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654;10%=10</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654;40%=40</p>


<p>&quot;What? It's just a small fry.&quot;</p>

<p>In an instant, I crouched down in front of the orc subspecies.</p>

<p>It was slightly stronger than a regular orc, but only about 1.5 times as powerful, not a significant opponent.</p>

<p>&quot;Ngaaah!?&quot;</p>

<p>A single flash.</p>

<p>I immediately decapitated the white orc with a single blow, killing it.</p>

<p>There's no way a D-Rank monster could stand a chance in a one-on-one fight.</p>

<p>&#12302;Conditions 1, 2, and 3 have been confirmed as achieved. Complete clear rewards will be granted.&#12303;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? I thought that since Nagisa was with me, it wouldn't count as a solo run, but I guess that's not the case?&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after, particles of light enveloped Nagisa and me, and we were teleported back inside the white Cube.</p>

<p>Probably, the dungeon collapse had ended upon defeating the boss, and we had returned to the original white Cube. I stared at the Cube.</p>


<p>Remaining magic power&#65306;30/100&#65288;+1/24hr&#65289;</p>

<p>Clear Difficulty&#65306;D-Rank</p>

<p>&#8251;In Sleep Mode</p>

<p>&#9670;Reward</p>

<p>First Clear Reward&#65288;Complete&#65289;&#65306;Magic Power +50</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition(s) 1&#12288;While the dungeon hasn&rsquo;t been cleared before, defeat the boss.</p>

<p>Complete Clear Reward (Complete)&#65306;+100 magic power, Class Upgrade Ticket (Beginner)</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 1&#12288;Clear while solo.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 2&#12288;Defeat a 50 or more orcs.</p>

<p>&#12539;Condition 3&#12288;Defeat the boss within five minute(s)&#12290;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there's a ticket too...&quot;</p>

<p>I picked up the bronze-colored ticket at my feet.</p>

<p>With this, I finally have ten of them.</p>

<p>&quot;Amachi-san... Thank you so much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, you're welcome. I'm really glad you're safe. Are you hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm fine. It was really scary, but I'm not injured! Oh, uh please forget about me crying!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, you did great. You're a good kid. Well done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since a while ago, haven&rsquo;t you been treating me like a child!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh? Is that so...?&quot;</p>

<p>I reached out to pat her head again but quickly withdrew my hand.</p>

<p>Nagisa seemed a bit disappointed, but it must have been my imagination. I almost committed sexual harassment.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's opening.&quot;</p>

<p>The white box that had enveloped us slowly opened, and it seemed that the dungeon had transitioned into sleep mode.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward, a roaring sound came from the sky, and a tremendous wind blew.</p>

<p>&quot;W-what's going on? Such a loud noise... Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>I looked up to see what was happening, and there was an imposing military? helicopter flying overhead.</p>

<p>And then, one after another, clearers who seemed to be overwhelmingly stronger than me descended, followed by a magician clad in a robe at the front.</p>

<p>&quot;Ta-Tanaka-san!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kai-kun, I'm glad you're safe. ...Wait, d-did you clear the dungeon? The D-Rank collapse? By yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>The person I had called for help was Tanaka Issei, the vice president of Japan's top guild, Avalon.</p>
