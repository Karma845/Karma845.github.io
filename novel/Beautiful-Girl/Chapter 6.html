<h2>Chapter 6: Club Experience</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p> <br />The night after Lily and Saito had a successful coin-earning spree.<br /> <br />Saito, in the midst of his pre-bath workout, heard his phone ping.<br /> <br />Wiping away the sweat on his cheek with a towel, he grabbed his phone to check.<br /> <br />“Can you go out with me tomorrow?”<br /> <br />The message was from a friend who supposedly died from drinking spoiled sweet bean soup (a lie).<br /> <br />Considering Lily got confessed to today, Saito briefly entertained the foolish idea that maybe he’s getting confessed to as well. But the sender was of the same gender, and the friend mentioned preferring girls smaller and prettier than him.<br /> <br />With Saito clearly outside that range with his appearance, there was no doubt he was way beyond their scope.<br /> <br />Shaking his head vigorously, he dismissed any unnecessary thoughts and replied to the message.<br /> <br />“What’s up out of the blue?”<br /> <br />“I’m thinking of joining a club for a trial.”<br /> <br />“Now? Isn’t it a bit late?”<br /> <br />As expected, the message about wanting to go out had nothing weird about it; he just wanted Saito to accompany him for a club trial.<br /> <br />However, it was puzzling that he waited a week into the trial period before inviting him. Saito sent his question, mirroring the doubt he had about his own message.<br /> <br />“Why the sudden interest?”<br /> <br />“Just stumbled upon it while wandering around school and felt like giving it a try.”<br /> <br />“Ah, I see. Kind of fits you, being all sea-like.”<br /> <br />After challenging them with questions, Saito received replies that matched his image of the friend he knew.<br /> <br />Given Saito’s own whimsical nature, he understood why such a message was sent out of the blue.<br /> <br />“Sure, why not.”<br /> <br />“Great (cat stamp).”<br /> <br />“How about inviting Haruki too?”<br /> <br />“Tried, but he turned me down, saying he’s joining the student council.”<br /> <br />“Damn, that’s low.”<br /> <br />“Betrayal deserves retaliation.”<br /> <br />“So, which club are you planning to join?”<br /> <br />“The Photography Club.”<br /> <br />Saito didn’t have any intention of joining a club when he entered high school since he planned to get a part-time job. However, he thought it wouldn’t hurt to try something like a club trial. W<br /> <br />hen he asked what club, the reply was the Photography Club.<br /> <br />“Oh, you kinda give off an artist vibe.”<br /> <br />“Now that you mention it, maybe I should join the Ikebana Archery Club.”<br /> <br />“Get a license and join the Moped Card Fight Club.”<br /> <br />Saito, having seen Kai taking pictures of cherry blossoms on the day they first met at the entrance ceremony, the choice seemed fitting to him.<br /> <br />He praised the decision, but it didn’t sit well with Kai, who started making twisted remarks, so Saito played along with the flow.<br /> <br />Exchanging jokes about joining absurd clubs, Saito and Kai continued until they both grew sleepy.<br /> <br />“Ohh… right. I should tell Lily that we won’t be going home together tomorrow.”<br /> <br />Putting down his phone and attempting to slip under the covers, Saito suddenly remembered this matter and sent a message.<br /> <br />While he was still awake, Kai, who had been looking at his phone, also sent a message. Almost instantly, a reply appeared with “Perfect timing.”<br /> <br />Even in his slightly drowsy state, Saito desperately tried to comprehend what was happening. Then another message from Lily continued the conversation.<br /> <br />“I was just invited by Shuri-chan to try out the Tennis Club, so…”<br /> <br />It seemed that Lily received a similar invitation from her friend Shuri around the same time.<br /> <br />The probability of both childhood friends receiving separate invitations at the same time was astonishing.<br /> <br />Realizing he had typed “Seriously” almost automatically, Saito was a bit surprised himself.<br /> <br />“For real. So, I was a bit surprised when I got a message from Saito.”<br /> <br />“It’s crazy how even friends we make resemble each other just because they’re childhood friends.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, it’s crazy. Well, because of that, let’s each go to our club activities tomorrow. No more walking home together.”<br /> <br />“Alright, have fun.”<br /> <br />“You too.”<br /> <br />“Well, I’m gonna sleep now. Goodnight, Riri.”<br /> <br />Despite the surprise dispelling some of his drowsiness, it was already the time he would usually be asleep.<br /> <br />While exchanging messages, the sleepiness returned to Saito.<br /> <br />For now, he had conveyed what he wanted to say, and everything seemed fine. It was safe to go to sleep.<br /> <br />With a sense of relief, Saito’s eyelids gradually closed. He sent a goodnight message and completely shut them.<br /> <br />As his consciousness sank into darkness, he faintly heard his phone ring again.<br /> <br />“Goodnight, Saito.”<br /> <br />Although it should have been a neutral robotic voice, to Saito, it sounded as if his childhood friend was gently weaving words. He slightly relaxed his expression, appearing happy, and peacefully fell into a deep sleep.<br /> </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p> <br />As the moon set and the sun rose, a considerable amount of time had passed.<br /> <br />Saito and Kai stepped into a school building they had never visited before.<br /> <br />“Is this the right school building?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, it should be. The club room should be at the end over there.”<br /> <br />Using their memories from the club introduction held a week ago as a guide, they walked, and Kai spotted the club room.<br /> <br />The location was at the far end of the building, where sunlight barely reached. As they approached the club room, a strong vinegar-like smell became more prominent.<br /> <br />“Is this really the photography club? It smells like vinegar.”<br /> <br />“Yep, you got it. Hey there!”<br /> <br />Saito felt unsure if he got it right.<br /> <br />However, Kai seemed familiar with the source of the smell and confidently opened the clubroom door.<br /> <br />Following Kai cautiously into the classroom, Saito discovered it was a typical photography club room, adorned with photos all around.<br /> <br />Awards and certificates from competitions were displayed, indicating a decent level of achievement.<br /> <br />As Saito scanned the room, there was no sign of other club members.<br /> <br />Probably, it had just turned into after-school, and no one had arrived yet.<br /> <br />Just as Saito noticed this, a door at the back of the clubroom opened, and a strong smell hit him.<br /> <br />Instinctively covering the lower half of his face, Saito looked towards the source. A casually dressed girl, seemingly unconcerned about her uniform, stood there.<br /> <br />“Oh, maybe new members? It’s rare at this time of the year. Are you here for a trial?”<br /> <br />“That’s right.”<br /> <br />“Yo!”<br /> <br />“Really?! I had given up on anyone coming this year, so it’s lucky that two of you showed up. Oh, we have tea; do you want some?”<br /> <br />“Don’t mind if we do.”<br /> <br />“Really? You don’t have to be so polite.”<br /> <br />“No, it’s not about being polite. The smell of vinegar is so strong that I can’t imagine settling down to drink tea.”<br /> <br />“Haha, I see. Sorry about that. We’re used to the smell of developing solution, but it can be intense for someone not accustomed. I’ll close the door right away.”<br /> <br />Upon realizing that Saito and Kai were there for a trial, the girl with silver mesh in her hair welcomed them cheerfully.<br /> <br />Despite her attempt to host them, Saito was more concerned about the overwhelming smell.<br /> <br />Requesting her to close the door, the girl apologized and complied.<br /> <br />As a result, the smell subsided to some extent, and Saito breathed a sigh of relief.<br /> <br />“Now it should be okay. Welcome to the Photography Club. I’m the club president, Utsuno Sayano. Nice to meet you.”<br /> <br />“I’m Akashi Kai, a first-year.”<br /> <br />“I’m Minazuki Saito, also a first-year.”<br /> <br />After settling down, we introduce ourselves to each other.<br /> <br />Some names were visible on the certificates and shields earlier, indicating that Sayano is likely someone impressive.<br /> <br />Despite appearances, Sayano might be the type to hang out with friends in town or have a blast at karaoke. People can be surprising.<br /> <br />“Akashi and Minazuki, I’ve got your names down. Um, just wait a moment. I had things set up for the trial club members, but no one showed up yesterday, so I dismantled everything. I’ll get it ready again, so please don’t leave.”<br /> <br />“Sure thing. I’ll pass the time by looking at photos.”<br /> <br />“I’ll show you some.”<br /> <br />“Thanks. I’ll be here waiting.”<br /> <br />With a booming sound that seemed out of place for a cultural club, Sayano flew out of the clubroom.<br /> <br />“She seems like a nice person. The current club president.”<br /> <br />” …… “<br /> <br />Although she appeared somewhat intimidating, talking to her revealed that she was unexpectedly friendly.<br /> <br />Saito praised President Utsuno, expecting a response from Kai, but there was none.<br /> <br />When Saito directed his gaze towards Kai, he found him staring intently at several framed photos.<br /> <br />“…Well, well. Not as much as me, but you’re good.”<br /> <br />“You’re talking from a guy who’s only been doing it as a hobby, man. Are you that good? “<br /> <br />After a while, Kai’s comment on the photos sounded somewhat condescending.<br /> <br />Saito, who had never seen Kai’s photos, suspected it might be mere sour grapes.<br /> <br />“Of course. I’m a genius.”<br /> <br />“Then show me some proof of your genius.”<br /> <br />“Sure. Here, take a look.”<br /> <br />“Wow, these are really amazing!”<br /> <br />“See?”<br /> <br />As Saito asked Kai to show his photos, he readily handed over his phone.<br /> <br />Despite Saito being somewhat ignorant about artistic matters, he could recognize that Kai’s photos were fantastic.<br /> <br />They were on par with the ones displayed in the clubroom.<br /> <br />Feeling astounded that Kai was just making excuses, Saito was left speechless. Kai, on the other hand, proudly puffed out his chest.<br /> <br />“Haa, haa, sorry to keep you waiting. Everything’s ready now.”<br /> <br />“Let’s take a break first, okay? No need to push yourself after such a full-on sprint.”<br /> <br />“Sure, let’s take a deep breath.”<br /> <br />“In, out, whoo…”<br /> <br />“That’s the Lamaze method. It’s not about relieving pain but getting your breathing in order.”<br /> <br />After Kai finishing the boast about his photos, the breathless Sayano returned to the clubroom.<br /> <br />About to smoothly transition into an explanation, she choked, prompting an abrupt interruption.<br /> <br />The two of them reassured the embarrassed Sayano, who was making odd movements due to embarrassment, and it took about five minutes for her to regain composure.<br /> <br />“Cough. Well then, let me explain the activities for today’s trial membership.”<br /> <br />To cover up her earlier blunder, Sayano cleared her throat and began the explanation of the activities.<br /> <br />“Yay!”<br /> <br />“Alright, been waiting for this!”<br /> <br />“You guys are lively. Thanks. Well, sorry for not being as exciting, but the activity is straightforward. Use this digital camera to take photos. Snap away as much as you like.”<br /> <br />“How generous!”<br /> <br />“Three-layered belly. Ugh!”<br /> <br />“Saying such things to a woman is rude, Akashi-kun.”<br /> <br />“S-Sorry. I-I’m sorry!”<br /> <br />The content seems like a typical one for the Photography Club.<br /> <br />However, Kai, who was looking forward to taking pictures, got too excited just with that and blurted out strange words, earning him an Iron Claw from Sayano.<br /> <br />(Idiot, seriously. Saying that to a woman – really not cool.)<br /> <br />Saito, who had experienced similar situations with Lily multiple times, conveniently ignores that fact this time.<br /> <br />Without any delicacy, he coldly watches the whole scene unfold, offering no help.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Given a digital camera, Saito and the others roamed inside the school building, taking pictures. After a while, they stepped outside.<br /> <br />The sky had only a few scattered clouds, and the sun shone brightly, making it a good weather day.<br /> <br />Feeling like he could capture something nice, Saito aimed his camera upwards and clicked the shutter.<br /> <br />“Hmm, mediocre.”<br /> <br />Looking at the screen, he confirmed that the photo he took was neither good nor bad.<br /> <br />Despite taking dozens of shots, they all looked similar, and he was starting to get a bit bored.<br /> <br />Unlike the photos taken by Sayano and Kai, which had a sense of presence and dynamism, Saito, lacking artistic sense, couldn’t seem to achieve the same.<br /> <br />(What should I do?)<br /> <br />Nevertheless, since he came for the club experience, he wanted to take at least one satisfying photo before going home.<br /> <br />Troubled by this, he noticed Kai staring off somewhere with a vague look.<br /> <br />(Maybe I’ll understand something if I watch him.)<br /> <br />If he could see how skilled individuals take photos, he might find hints to improve.<br /> <br />Thinking so, Saito decided to observe his friend’s actions.<br /> <br />Click.<br /> <br />Just as he thought that, Kai unexpectedly pressed the shutter.<br /> <br />Startled, Saito looked at the photo, but there was nothing particularly noteworthy.<br /> <br />(Maybe I’ll understand if I look again.)<br /> <br />Although he was caught off guard before, this time he was determined to observe closely. He stared intently at Kai’s every move.<br /> <br />Click, click.<br /> <br />However, no matter how much he watched, he couldn’t understand anything.<br /> <br />Kai seemed to aimlessly wander, taking photos as if something compelled him suddenly.<br /> <br />Every photo seemed to capture scenes that Saito wouldn’t even consider photographing, making him doubt if he was capturing good images.<br /> <br />Finally, unable to endure it any longer, Saito asked Kai, “How do you decide what to photograph?”<br /> <br />Kai responded,<br /> <br />“When it sparkles, shines.”<br /> <br />“When it sparkles?<br /> <br />There wasn’t anything sparkling at all.”<br /> <br />“It’s sparkling. Glittering. I like taking pictures of things that shine the most.”<br /> <br />“Hmm. I got nothing useful from that.”<br /> <br />Despite asking for a detailed explanation, Saito couldn’t get anything beyond the fact that Kai liked things that sparkle.<br /> <br />As expected from someone who claims to be a genius, Kai sees a different world from ordinary people.<br /> <br />It was a mistake to ask a genius.<br /> <br />Determined to try again, Saito decided to ask the Photography Club president, Sayano.<br /> <br />After all, she had been in the club for three years. She should be good at teaching others.<br /> <br />But…<br /> <br />“The secret to taking good photos? If it feels good, just press the button.”<br /> <br />“Oh, is that so?”<br /> <br />(You’re also a sense-based person!)<br /> <br />He was completely shot down.<br /> <br />He thought she would teach him about color combinations or angles, but instead, he received no proper advice.<br /> <br />It seems the Photography Club is a nest of sense-based individuals.<br /> <br />“Come on, don’t make that face. Photography is just a means of recording the feeling of ‘Wow, this is nice’ or ‘Wow, this is beautiful.’ To keep those feelings alive. Just do it without thinking too much; that’s the best way.”<br /> <br />“Alright.”<br /> <br />(If not thinking too much were enough, I wouldn’t be asking!)<br /> <br />As Sayano patted his shoulders encouragingly, Saito internally sighed, feeling disappointed.<br /> <br />“Well, you don’t seem satisfied at all. Then, I’ll give you a special piece of advice. Try looking for something incredibly beautiful.”<br /> <br />“Beautiful things?”<br /> <br />“Don’t miss the ‘incredibly’ part. That’s crucial.”<br /> <br />“Got it.”<br /> <br />“Minazuki-kun seems to have a broader perspective than most people and is always conscious of various things. So, while it looks like you’re concentrating on one thing, you’re actually paying attention to other things at the same time. For example, even if you think the sky is beautiful, at the same time, you find the flowers in the flower bed beautiful. Your scattered awareness is why you haven’t taken a satisfying photo. So, if you find something overwhelmingly charming, to the point where you don’t notice anything else around, you’ll surely take a satisfying photo.”<br /> <br />“Understood. I’ll give it a try.”<br /> <br />Judging by Saito’s clearly disappointed expression, it seems he easily understood.<br /> <br />Unable to be seen as a senior with such eyes from a junior, Sayano, whose pride was stimulated, gave another piece of advice.<br /> <br />The essence of the camera, not something general or worldly but something personal for Saito.<br /> <br />Initially, due to her lack of words, he couldn’t grasp the meaning, but as she continued talking, Lily understood what she wanted to convey.<br /> <br />It seems Saito is not good at focusing on one thing.<br /> <br />Thinking about it,<br /> <br />there were indeed instances where his reactions were delayed when observing Kai’s actions. It makes sense if unconsciously his attention was diverted to something else.<br /> <br />And looking back at the photos he took, there were multiple main subjects scattered in each photo.<br /> <br />(Something with overwhelming charm… Is there something like that in this school?)<br /> <br />If there’s something he can be passionate about, he can capture it well.<br /> <br />Sayano said that, but this is proving to be more challenging than she thought.<br /> <br />Because, Saito has captured almost everything in this high school.<br /> <br />It’s questionable if there’s anything left in this high school that can capture Saito’s passion.<br /> <br />“Hey, Itocchi~!”<br /> <br />Wandering aimlessly, Saito hears a voice calling him from afar.<br /> <br />Glancing in that direction, he sees Lily and her friend Shuri.<br /> <br />Wondering what’s going on, Saito runs towards them.<br /> <br />“Hey, what’s up?”<br /> <br />“We’re going to have a match with Lily-chan now. So, we happened to find Itocchi with a camera and thought of getting some cool shots.”<br /> <br />“It’s fine. I was kind of free anyway. Just don’t expect too much since I’m not that good.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Really? I don’t have the image of Itocchi being bad at it.”<br /> <br />Lily and Shuri seem to know what Saito does in the photography club. So, they called Saito to take pictures since he was nearby.<br /> <br />However, if they’re going to take photos, Saito honestly thinks that Kai would be more suitable than him.<br /> <br />Although he’ll do it since he was asked, he sets up a preemptive line, saying not to complain even if he’s bad.<br /> <br />Seeing this unsure attitude from her childhood friend, Lily feels a sense of discomfort and tilts her head.<br /> <br />“The world seems to be wider than we think, Lily.”<br /> <br />“Huh, am I being made fun of for being bad at taking photos too?”<br /> <br />“Hold on, Lily. Violence is not okay.”<br /> <br />Lily has only seen group photos taken by Saito, with multiple main subjects in each.<br /> <br />So, she doesn’t know yet that Saito is not good at taking individual photos.<br /> <br />Although he intended to tell Lily about it, it seems he phrased it poorly, leading to Lily’s irritation.<br /> <br />With a dark aura emitting, Lily repeatedly hits her palm with the racket, making a sound.<br /> <br />If Shuri hadn’t intervened, he would have undoubtedly received a punch.<br /> <br />Saito was grateful from the bottom of her heart that someone stepped in.<br /> <br />After that, they managed to clear up Lily’s misunderstanding.<br /> <br />“It’s okay even if Saito is not good. Because, both Shuri-chan and I are cute.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, that’s right. So, don’t worry, Itocchi.”<br /> <br />“…The people around me really have high self-esteem.”<br /> <br />Confidently asserting that no matter how they are photographed, they will look cute, the two of them make Saito dryly smile as the photo session and the match begin.<br /> <br />“Yo!”<br /> <br />“Hoo!”<br /> <br />“Take that!”<br /> <br />“Here!”<br /> <br />He capture the moments of the two playing tennis.<br /> <br />Maybe because he have good material to work with, the photos turn out fine without anything strange.<br /> <br />However, due to the scattered focus, the photo subtly deviate from the center, and the focus is mostly on the rackets and balls. It’s not easy to say he’s skilled.<br /> <br />(Difficult, photography is. Maybe I can’t take pictures like Sea after all.)<br /> <br />Just when he was about to give up on being suitable for photography, it unexpectedly happens.<br /> <br />“Uwaa! I almost lost—so frustrating!”<br /> <br />“Yay! I won. Hey, did you see, Saito?”<br /> <br />Having never played tennis before, the two beginners, Lily and Shuri, competed in a two-game match, and Lily emerged as the winner.<br /> <br />The defeated Shuri stomped her feet in frustration, while the victorious Lily happily ran towards Saito.<br /> <br />“Oh, I saw it. You’re good at tennis, huh?”<br /> <br />“Thanks to Saito!”<br /> <br />“Huh, me? I didn’t do anything.”<br /> <br />“Remember when you taught me how to play tennis a long time ago? That helped me win today.”<br /> <br />“Huh, really? Was that helpful?”<br /> <br />Come to think of it, he bragged to Lily about attending a tennis experience class when he was in elementary school.<br /> <br />Although most of what he said was boasting and not useful at all, Lily remembers it with a proud smile.<br /> <br />Never did he dream that what he taught Lily that day would prove useful.<br /> <br />“Yeah. So, thank you, Saito!”<br /> <br />[Thanks!]<br /> <br />(Oh, is this what Kai meant by sparkling?)<br /> <br />Like the day they first met, Lily directs a pure, untainted smile of gratitude towards Saito.<br /> <br />The figure looked mysteriously sparkling, and as Saito raised his camera, pressing the shutter button, he wondered if this was how his friend saw the world.<br /> <br />After a moment, a photo appeared on the screen, and as Saito looked at it, a satisfied smile crossed his face.<br /> <br />“You look incredibly beautiful.”<br /> <br />“Huh?! Wh-what are you suddenly…”<br /> <br />Looking directly at Lily’s face, he conveyed his thoughts, causing her face to blush like a boiled octopus.<br /> <br />“I thought that while taking pictures. What? Are you embarrassed? Even though you’re usually called beautiful?”<br /> </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/r0ZCSEj.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>


<p>Now, expecting Lily to casually deflect any compliments, Saito was surprised to see Lily only blinking his eyes.<br /> <br />“It’s not like I’m embarrassed. I just exercised a bit and got a bit heated, that’s all.”<br /> <br />“Adadada, don’t play it cool. You’re stronger than those guys around you.”<br /> <br />Lily, with teary eyes, not in a cute way but with determination, hits him hard, and Saito, feeling the pain, quickly escaped from the spot.<br /> <br />“Who’s the gorilla!? Hey, wait, Saito!”<br /> <br />“I didn’t say anything like that; it’s just your delusion. Calm down.”<br /> <br />“Ah, youth.”<br /> <br />Suddenly, a game of tag between the childhood friends began.<br /> <br />Shuri watched, laughing heartily at the unexpected turn of events.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />“Alright, it’s time for today’s presentation of achievements!”<br /> <br />“Wow!”<br /> <br />Thirty minutes before the end of school.<br /> <br />As planned, Saito and Kai returned to the clubroom to have Utsuno evaluate the photos they took.<br /> <br />They printed out the photos they thought turned out best from today’s shoot.<br /> <br />Currently, Saito and Kai each hold a printed photo between their fingers like a card.<br /> <br />“Let’s show them in alphabetical order. Akashi, go ahead.”<br /> <br />“I’ll show you the overwhelming difference.”<br /> <br />Saying that, Kai was the first to reveal a photo.<br /> <br />“Whoa, you captured the sheet music flying in the sky! And there’s the sun in the center of the photo; the composition is excellent.”<br /> <br />The photo Kai showed was so perfect that Saito and Utsuno couldn’t help but admire it.<br /> <br />Saito and Sayano were amazed at the picture that was so perfect that it looked as if it had been taken by a professional.<br /> <br />“Of course. Now, what about yours, Saito?”<br /> <br />Having received compliments, Kai was in high spirits and extended his nose.<br /> <br />Saito, thinking he would casually brush it off, blinked his eyes in surprise.<br /> <br />“My photo is this.”<br /> <br />With a determined voice, Saito presented the photo he took of Lily earlier.<br /> <br />The photo showed a beautiful girl smiling with the sunset as a backdrop, and honestly, Saito was proud of how well it turned out.<br /> <br />Thinking that it might not break Kai’s extended nose, but at least it could bend it back, he looked at his friend.<br /> <br />With that in mind, Saito turn eyes to Kai, who is staring at the picture.<br /> <br />“…… Beautiful “<br /> <br />“That’s right.”<br /> <br />“Wow, I didn’t expect that just giving some advice would result in such a photo. Could it be the power of love?”<br /> <br />“We’re childhood friends, so it’s not like that.”<br /> <br />“Oh, come on, this girl is so cute; you must like her, right, Minazuki-kun?”<br /> <br />“As a childhood friend, I do like her, but…”<br /> <br />“Kyaa! See, it makes sense. Tell big sister all kinds of stories, okay?”<br /> <br />“Were you listening!? I just said I like her as a childhood friend. Why do you get such weird misunderstandings? It’s annoying.”<br /> <br />“You’re cute when you get desperate.”<br /> <br />“Annoying! This girl and I are really just childhood friends.”<br /> <br />Having successfully revealed the truth about his friend’s nose, Saito smiled happily.<br /> <br />However, this joy was short-lived as Utsuno, who was nearby, misunderstood the relationship between Saito and Lily, approaching them with an unpleasant grin.<br /> <br />So, at that moment, desperately trying to clarify the misunderstanding,<br /> <br />Saito didn’t notice the heat in his friend’s eyes as he looked at Lily’s photo.<br /> <br />And he never imagined that this photo would lead to something like that.</p>
