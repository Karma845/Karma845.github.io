<p><h2>Chapter 6: The Spirit Summoning Ceremony</h2></p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">1</h4></p>

<p>It was the next day. I got out of bed early morning to jog on the island, took a shower when I returned to my room, made salt apple juice and drank it to get my magic flowing perfectly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haa~. The salt apple juice made from our family recipe is the best, it&rsquo;s so refreshing. Maybe I&rsquo;ll try some other recipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The recipes written on old parchment. With my glass of juice in one hand, I flipped through the recipe book Grandmother gave me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Mmm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on...the recipe page for salt apple juice was giving me a strange feeling of discomfort.</p>

<p>Just when I thought that it looked like the words and illustrations were shaking,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wah!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They suddenly burst open and started rampaging on the page, and the words written on it were rapidly changing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On it, in handwriting, was this.</p>

<p>Dear Diary.</p>

<p>My mood today is absolutely terrible. My hair, my pride, got cut off by that man.</p>

<p>As revenge, I condemned him to the punishment of being hung up by the threads of pride.</p>

<p>The incantation is this.</p>

<p>Maki rie luci ah&#12540;Crimson reason, doll of blood, turn, turn, red spinning wheel.</p>

<p>P.S. Popo and Don have gathered many walnuts.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will bake walnut bread and binge eat it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...A diary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They even wrote &ldquo;Dear Diary,&rdquo; so it probably was one.</p>

<p>After I finished drinking my salt apple juice in one go, the page quietly returned to the original recipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh...I see. You make something according to the recipe on the page, and only while you eat or drink it does the content change to the diary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I perceived these sorts of things quickly because I was a genius.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The name should be hidden somewhere in the first incantation, so I wonder if the writer of this diary is called Maki or Rie or Lucia? A woman, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know when this witch was from, but it was an interesting gimmick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyways, Lapis, it&rsquo;s time to get up~! You&rsquo;re surprisingly a sleepyhead.&rdquo;</p>

<p> Classes started immediately today. It was the first and biggest critical point for us.</p>

<p>As is tradition at Lune Ruschia Magic School, the first-years first perform the &ldquo;spirit summoning ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This magic school had a high-performance spirit summoning circle that could even be used by inexperienced magicians to summon spirits and use them as familiars.</p>

<p>However, each spirit that appears is different, reflecting family lineage, the environment you are brought up in, and your personality.</p>

<p>Taking into account the fact that all the great magicians of renown have used Great Spirits, it could be said that the spirit that appears is a hint of the person&rsquo;s potential.</p>

<p>Although, I&rsquo;ve heard that it was mostly like picking lots where only luck mattered&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, today&rsquo;s Spirit Magic Studies class is in the first ceremony hall. ...Oh, you&rsquo;re bringing Noah with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I was confirming where we were taking class, Lapis was standing next to me, holding her own spirit, Noah the black cat, in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Those who are already using a spirit and have applied to the school were asked to bring them to class today. It seems that the teacher is looking for a relationship of mutual trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe our instructor for Spirit Magic Studies is Yuri Ulysses Le Ruschia. I know who he is. He&rsquo;s the second prince of this country, and the most powerful spirit magician in the country&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that he summoned three Great Spirits at the same time when he was only five years old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was an incredible child prodigy. So much that his name is already in history books~. My father met him once before and he said something about his aura being different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although, it was strange that he wanted to become a teacher at a magic school despite being a prince. I wonder what kind of teacher would he be?</p>

<p>The first ceremony hall was an old stone temple on the west side of the island.</p>

<p>When we went there five minutes before class started, there were already students gathered there, exchanging information for creating teams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss O&rsquo;Drielle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you two already decided your teams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Students flocked around me and Lapis, and we received many invitations to group together, to aim to be the honor student on the same team, and so on.</p>

<p>I wondered if it was because I proudly named myself as an O&rsquo;Drielle in front of people yesterday. I was a little surprised because I thought no one would invite me.</p>

<p>But I still had the right to make my own choice. First of all, I needed to assess the talents and potentials of each person at today&rsquo;s spirit summoning ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, first-years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person who appeared was a young man with soft-looking white hair, mystical citrus yellow eyes, and handsome features. He was wearing a long white robe, carrying a long staff in his hand, and there was an owl spirit on his shoulder.</p>

<p>His elegant, royalty-like appearance as well as his gentle and mysterious smile made all the girls sigh.</p>

<p>From appearances, he looked young enough to have recently graduated from magic school. In fact, he must have been classmates with Professor Medite&#8230; Basically, he was just before thirty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Ulysses. There are several other ways to call me, but Ulysses will do. This little one on my shoulder is Phantrome. He had a name beforehand. In other words, he is a &lsquo;Named Spirit,&rsquo; and his attributes are the double elements of&#12304;Wind&#12305;and&#12304;Darkness&#12305;. He is a symbol of wisdom that supports my class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was gentle, and he was always smiling.</p>

<p>In addition, a spirit with double elements was very rare. I believe I read in a book that the owl Great Spirit, Phantrome, was also a familiar of the famous &ldquo;White Sage,&rdquo; as was Headmaster Pan.</p>

<p>The professor first put a silver goblet on a desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magic is invoked with a first incantation and a second incantation. All of you who are brilliant enough to pass this school&rsquo;s entrance exams already know that. For example, in my case&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, he raised his long staff,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuri yuno sys&#12540;O, water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He precisely chanted the incantations, and then water spilled out of the goblet that had been empty.</p>

<p>It was simple magic, and from the point of view of Professor Ulysses, it was probably magic that could be used without an incantation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yuri yuno sys. That part is the first incantation. The first incantation is the incantation that &lsquo;releases your own magical power,&rsquo; and is sometimes called the &lsquo;key word&rsquo; that opens the door of magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes. The first incantation included your own name, and each person could set it as they pleased. In my case, as soon as I was named Makia, Father created it for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, once you have decided it, you can never change it again, and there is basically only one &lsquo;key word&rsquo; that opens your magic. There are exceptions, though. ...Therefore, no matter what magic you use, you need that first incantation. Even when you use magic without chanting, you must chant it in your mind. We are swearing to the world that we will use magic responsibly in our own name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Also, you had to present your first incantation to the kingdom when you entered magic school.</p>

<p>It would also serve as proof of your identity as a magician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second incantation is the incantation that &lsquo;directs the content of the magic.&rsquo; Depending on the magic, some have incantations that are recommended fixed phrases, while others have been arranged for ease of use. You can omit chanting if it is simple magic or familiar magic, but on the other hand, the more complicated the magic, the more the importance of the second incantation increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The matter of what could be done with the second incantation varied depending on each person&rsquo;s ability, training, and knowledge.</p>

<p> And how much you understood and believed in the magical power that resided in the world&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Spirit Magic Studies, you will mainly learn about the spirits that are involved with the second incantation. Spirits are the embodiments of this world&rsquo;s magical power. They dwell in nature, such as plants, animals, the sky, the sea, and forests, and also embody the mysteries of great magic. Magicians borrow power from the spirits in the world to perform magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For instance, if you use water magic, where does the water come from?</p>

<p>In that case, water was sent to you from a river, lake, or sea somewhere in Maydare via spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also, magicians can summon and use the spirits themselves. By using them, we can preferentially borrow power from our own spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, Professor Ulysses stood on top of the magic circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a giant spirit summoning circle. Each student can summon a spirit once, free of charge. However, the number of spirits a person can use has a limit depending on each person&rsquo;s magical power, so make your contracts carefully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the students had excited faces that said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spirit summoning essentially required an enormous amount of magical power and complicated magic circles, and it wasn't a magic that one magician could use easily.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was a magic that could only be used in large institutions such as schools and with the help of experts.</p>

<p>In that case, you needed a large amount of money, and it wasn&rsquo;t always possible to get the spirit you hoped for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, let us begin. One at a time, please stand in the center of the magic circle and chant &lsquo;First incantation&mdash;&mdash;In this name, manifest, my spirit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everyone answered &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; energetically.</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses started chanting a lengthy incantation in order to start the ceremony, and then a faint light lit up in the center of the magic circle. A male student stood there first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allen kuku mora&mdash;&mdash;In this name, manifest, my spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that, the magic circle released a strong light, and then with a puff of smoke, something appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wah! A water rabbit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a rather rugged boy, so the disparity of seeing him with a rabbit with light blue fur was cute.</p>

<p>Its attribute was&#12304;Water&#12305;, and it was a nameless medium-grade spirit, but they consumed less magical power and were easy to use. It was said that those who wanted to master water magic in particular always used one.</p>

<p>Therefore, the boy seemed to have decided to form a contract with it.</p>

<p>In this way, the spirit summoning ceremony was performed one after another. In addition to rabbits, most of them were animal-type spirits in the forms of dogs, foxes, doves, frogs, deer, peacocks, et cetera, but it was said that as a magician grew and learned more advanced summoning techniques, a spirit could take on a humanoid form or a greater divine beast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agh, I can&rsquo;t deal with this &lsquo;failure&rsquo; spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were those who groaned that, not making a contract with the spirit they had just summoned.</p>

<p>But since spirit summoning was something that was rarely done, basically everyone made a contract. If you didn&rsquo;t use a spirit, the purity of your magic changed, and the more difficult the magic, the more you needed to ask for the help of a spirit.</p>

<p>In particular, the attribute of the spirit was important, as they were related to the magic you wanted to master in the future and your personality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bea to riche&mdash;&mdash;In the name of Asta, manifest, my spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The one who arbitrarily made changes to the incantation was that Beatrice Asta.</p>

<p>Her first incantation was also just her name, and it just screamed that she was very confident in herself.</p>

<p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t help but be convinced of the meaning of that self-confidence when the magic circle emitted an intense light, and there was a surge of purple lightning that we haven&rsquo;t seen before until now.</p>

<p>Finally, a unicorn with a greenish silver coat appeared in the center of the magic circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it! A green silver unicorn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beatrice&rsquo;s retinue was crying and applauding her as she was getting more fired up.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, there was a unicorn on the Asta family crest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well done. It seems that you have successfully summoned a high-level spirit. Its attribute is&#12304;Grass&#12305;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Highness! I have done it! A spirit worthy of the Asta family name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses&rsquo; smile stiffened slightly when he was called &ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; but he only answered &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to hear that&rdquo; in an unchanging tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, next is Mr. Nero Pachelbel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chattering students became quiet.</p>

<p>Because Nero Pachelbel was at the head of us first-years, so everyone was expecting him to be the best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pachelbel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he didn&rsquo;t appear. Or rather, he wasn&rsquo;t here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about his roommate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His roommate is Frey Levi. He isn&rsquo;t here either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I, see. To think that the head of the class would skip the first class. And what&rsquo;s more, the spirit summoning ceremony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses put his hand on his chin and smiled strainedly.</p>

<p>Maybe there was no precedent for that. But it was true that he wasn&rsquo;t here.</p>

<p>Wasting such a rare opportunity...What were you thinking, Nero Pachelbel?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, lastly, Miss Makia O&rsquo;Drielle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I jumped in surprise at my name being called. And then, I stood in the center of the magic circle like everyone else.</p>

<p>The eyes of my classmates were focused on me. How many spirits would I summon as the successor of the O&rsquo;Drielle family?</p>

<p>Grandmother had a dove, Father had a crow, Mother had a snake, and Uncle also had a snake.</p>

<p>The O&rsquo;Drielle family had a high percentage of crow familiars, and the Medite family had a family crest with a snake.</p>

<p>I was worried about how those factors would work.</p>

<p>Ah, my heart was beating fast. I&rsquo;ve decided that no matter what kind of spirit it was, if it came to me, I would love it with all my heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myr vis makia&mdash;&mdash;In this name, manifest, my spirit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I chanted the recommended fixed incantation as it was.</p>

<p>Then, the magic circled glowed with a bright red light, and everyone got excited at seeing this display that hadn&rsquo;t been seen until now, and then they closed their eyes because it was too bright.</p>

<p>The light finally subsided, and we opened our eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Hmm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, I couldn&rsquo;t see the spirit anywhere. As I looked around, some student shouted, &ldquo;Your feet!&rdquo; I also dropped my gaze to my feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Mice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two small mice scampering about on the magic circle.</p>

<p>There was a white and round mouse and a yellow and small mouse. They both had short and round tails.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pff. Rats are the lowest of the low-grades.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughter broke out in the class at Beatrice Asta&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>I also stood rooted to the spot in shock, but,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong. These aren&rsquo;t rats. ...They&rsquo;re hamsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held out my hand to the two scampering mice and called out in a gentle voice, &ldquo;Come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, the two of them got on my palm and sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They look just like the ham-chan I had before&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stroke the two.</p>

<p>Small. Cute. Fluffy and warm. They&rsquo;re alive!</p>

<p>By the way, when I said &ldquo;before,&rdquo; I meant my past life. When I was in elementary school, my brother begged our parents for a hamster, but no one ended up taking care of it, so I did.</p>

<p>The hamster died after just two years, but it was a suffocating household, so it helped me de-stress by listening to me talk about all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Everyone had strange looks on their faces, but these two hamsters made me extremely happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Judging from appearances, these are spirits in the forms of dwarf hamsters. They have short tails, and their very large cheek pouches are their characteristics, and they can stuff anything in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses said, and the students laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They also have various attributes depending on their coat color. It seems that the white-haired one has the&#12304;Water&#12305;attribute, and the yellow-haired one has the&#12304;Fire&#12305;attribute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor, with a slightly complicated look on his face, asked me, &ldquo;Do you want to cancel the contract?&rdquo; But I hurriedly shook my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no. I&rsquo;m fine with these two. Oh, is it not allowed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that it isn&rsquo;t allowed. I&rsquo;m only asking because people who summon mice or hamsters often don&rsquo;t make contracts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, Professor Ulysses smiled the gentlest smile I had ever seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rare to summon two spirits at the same time. Please take good care of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then clapped his hands and said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all for today&rsquo;s class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spirit summoning ceremony ended without incident in this way, but the students were still giggling at my spirits. Was summoning hamsters that funny?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The O&rsquo;Drielle house is not such a big deal after all, despite declaring that so impressively. It&rsquo;s impossible that someone from a prestigious family would summon the lowest-ranked spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beatrice Asta went out of her way to pass by me and said a snide remark loud enough for me to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she was overawed because she went right after Lady Beatrice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that Lady Beatrice is a true witch that the goddess of luck is smiling upon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The retinue was diligently buttering her up. Ignore it, ignore it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you okay, Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Lapis. You can&rsquo;t improve your magic if you&rsquo;re relying on your spirit&rsquo;s rank. And look at these little ones. They&rsquo;re so cute~&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lapis and I peeked at the two ham-chans sleeping in the pocket of my robe.</p>

<p>Two round furballs. The ham-chans were cuddling together, making &ldquo;puu puu&rdquo; and &ldquo;chee chee&rdquo; sounds, looking as innocent as babies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, you aren&rsquo;t disappointed about these spirits, I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. A true magician can turn any spirit into a splendid familiar. I have to take responsibility for raising them now that I made the contract.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even if people made fun of them for being low-rank, I was simply happy.</p>

<p>About how I was able to get my own familiars. About the fact that these little ones came to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haa. But come to think of it, your familiar&rsquo;s a cat, Lapis. Would he chase my hamsters!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No need to worry. Noah is a good and obedient kitty. I think he&rsquo;d adore them, actually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As though to say, that&rsquo;s right, Noah, who was at Lapis&rsquo; feet, made a rare &ldquo;Meow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">2</h4></p>

<p>On that day, there were no classes other than the &ldquo;spirit summoning ceremony&rdquo;, so we had free time in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Lapis was the only one who went to a different classroom, since she had to attend an orientation for international students or something like that.</p>

<p>I immediately went to the school&rsquo;s tool store to buy wood and glass to prepare a cage to raise the two dwarf hamsters in, relying on my past life memories of having a hamster.</p>

<p>Senior Nagie, the leader of the girls&rsquo; dorm, told me that there was an atelier on the outskirts of the island I could use freely, so I thought I&rsquo;d make the cage there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Ulysses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the tool store, I coincidentally ran into Professor Ulysses from Spirit Magic class.</p>

<p>For some reason, he was in front of the sweets shelf, looking at cookies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was the first class? You summoned two spirits, but you seem to be doing well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing well...what do you mean by that, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usually, after that class, everyone would be drained of their magic power and become exhausted. That is why that is the only class on the first day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s the case. No, I&rsquo;m feeling great. I think it&rsquo;s probably because I drank salt apple juice before I did it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said that proudly, but the professor didn&rsquo;t seem to get it, and rather looked at the lumber I was carrying curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you do with those?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want to make a cage for the two ham-cha...dwarf hamster spirits I summoned today. And a hamster wheel for them to play with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufufu. Unlike ordinary animals, though, spirits can live as they please. You&rsquo;re the first student I&rsquo;ve seen who would go this far for a mouse or hamster spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those at your age can only measure the quality of a spirit by its rarity or rank. It isn&rsquo;t wrong, but if we&rsquo;re only concerned with that, then we won&rsquo;t be able to perceive the true nature of the spirit. Spirits have hearts as well, and they get hurt when they&rsquo;re simply called &lsquo;failures.&rsquo; In addition, they only lend their power to masters they can trust. There&rsquo;s no harm in loving them as much as you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Okay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses didn&rsquo;t make fun of my hamster spirits, unlike the other students.</p>

<p>As expected of the leading figure in spirit magic. He probably loved spirits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, I know you&rsquo;re very knowledgeable about spirits, professor, but what do these little ones eat? It&rsquo;s sunflower seeds, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sunflower seeds? Ahahahahaha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses laughed aloud, a rare occurrence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to give food to spirits. However, there are those who enjoy it as an indulgence, so it&rsquo;s good to give them something as a part of physical intimacy. I also came here to buy biscuits, which are Phantrome&rsquo;s favorites. He&rsquo;s selfish enough to even specify the maker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoo hoo. It&rsquo;s because His Highness works me quite hard. I believe it&rsquo;s a fair price to pay. Hoo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owl spirit on Professor Ulysses&rsquo; shoulder talked&#8230;!</p>

<p>I see, so the professor was standing before the sweets shelf because he was buying its favorite food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, did you bring two hamsters along with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. They&rsquo;re in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ham-chans were squirming around in my pocket, but when I called them, they climbed onto my shoulder. They were a bit slow and dumb looking, but Professor Ulysses smiled fondly as he looked at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem like anyone noticed, but these two are actually named spirits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh, really!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was looking forward to naming them, but I was a little shocked.</p>

<p>However, named spirits were spirits that once performed a great achievement under someone.</p>

<p>These frail little ham-chans were...Aah, they were rubbing against me. So cute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor, do you know their names?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The white one is Popoloactus, and the yellow one is Dontanates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Th-those are surprisingly excessive names&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are two spirits that served the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo; They aren&rsquo;t recorded in any text, so no one knows about them. If these little ones are the spirits who appeared, then Miss Makia, you certainly have the blood of the Scarlet Witch running through your veins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Scarlet Witch. The world&rsquo;s worst witch.</p>

<p>I had no idea that these two were the spirits that served my ancestor, and I could only look down at the ham-chans on my shoulder in astonishment.</p>

<p>&rdquo;No matter how excellent a spirit you use, it is up to the master to draw out its power. On the other hand, even the smallest spirit can become an invaluable partner if you establish a strong bond with it and know its characteristics well. You didn&rsquo;t judge your spirits by their ranks, but immediately said that you will make them your familiars. &#8230;Please work hard on your spirit magic with confidence. I am sure those two will respond to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Ulysses nodded and took a box of cookies to the register.</p>

<p>Even though he was a prince, he didn&rsquo;t act self-importantly and was kind. He was a good teacher whose words resounded in your heart.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Huh? But I wonder how Professor Ulysses knew the names of spirits that aren&rsquo;t recorded in any text. Maybe he had to do a lot of research in order to become a teacher of spirit magic&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I adjusted the lumber I was holding in my arms with a huff, I had a small question in my mind.</p>

<p><h4 style="text-align:center;">3</h4></p>

<p>The cluster of ateliers at the end of the island was commonly known as the &ldquo;glass bottle ateliers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was because that cluster of ateliers were facilities that resembled empty glass bottles that were scattered here and there, set into the shelf-like cliffs. They were very interesting to look at because of their diverse shapes and colors.</p>

<p>This place could be used freely by students, but it seemed that a more convenient atelier cluster was constructed on the island center recently, so the old ateliers around here weren&rsquo;t popular.</p>

<p>However, I heard there were many upperclassmen in those central ateliers, so I came here to make the cage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit inconvenient, but it&rsquo;s just like a magician&rsquo;s atelier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true that it wasn&rsquo;t very popular, but there was a male student at a work table quietly doing something in the light-blue glass bottle atelier I entered.</p>

<p>What should I do, should I go to another atelier&#8230;?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I called out to him anyways, the boy noticed me and raised his work glasses or goggles to his forehead. It properly tucked in his thin platinum blond bangs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of his eyes was a vivid magenta color&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That was when I finally realized who this boy was. It was the head of our year, Nero Pachelbel.</p>

<p>He even skipped the spirit summoning ceremony, but he was actually here.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Makia O&rsquo;Drielle. You&rsquo;re Nero Pachelbel, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Yeah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A reply without a hint of friendliness. He had already put on his goggles and was looking down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to use this place. Is that okay with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care...do what you want. It&rsquo;s a shared space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a slender, well-featured boy, but he was a lot more aloof than I expected.</p>

<p>I placed the wood and glass sheets I had bought on top of a large table and searched for the necessary tools.</p>

<p>Even so, this was a strange atelier. I couldn&rsquo;t see the inside very well from the outside, but I could see the outside from the inside perfectly fine. It was spacious, and you could see the sea from here, which made me wonder why such a nice atelier wasn&rsquo;t popular.</p>

<p>When I checked the second floor, I saw that it was a storage room, complete with tools. I could look down on the first floor from here.</p>

<p>The arched ceiling had a milky-white coating that didn&rsquo;t become transparent until halfway up, which seemed to be a mechanism for blocking heat and light. To keep the room cool and comfortable during the day, the magic coating on the ceiling also had an air conditioning function.</p>

<p>If you needed an enclosed, dark place, you could use the basement. This light blue glass bottle atelier seemed to be enough to work as a magician.</p>

<p>I quickly tied my hair up, took off my robe, and started work. I wondered if he was bothered that I started clanking, thumping, and clanging right in front of him. Nero Pachelbel would look up from time to time and watch what I was doing.</p>

<p>I was also interested in his work. What exactly was he doing?</p>

<p>It seemed that he was applying details on something small with a thin rod while it sprinkled light around. After I reached a stopping place in my own work, I sneakily went behind him and saw that he was writing a magic formula on a seemingly thin and round glass-like thing&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re really good at such dexterous work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was watching him work from behind him unnoticed, so Nero Pachelbel was a little surprised and turned around with a somewhat unamused look on his face. But I didn&rsquo;t mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a contact lens? Is the reason your eye&rsquo;s a different color because you&rsquo;re wearing this lens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the entrance ceremony, I was wondering why both your eyes were brown. Because when I saw you before, both your eyes were a pretty magenta color. Magenta is the true color of your eyes, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero Pachelbel was silent for a while, and then took off his goggles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The color of my eyes are too flashy, and it&rsquo;s considered forbidden in this country. I attract attention whether I like it or not, so I wear lenses in a bland and subdued color. They&rsquo;re handy magical tools.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Magical tools&#8230;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the product of leading edge magic with magical circuitry. Although I doubt it has taken root in Ruschia yet. ...In the first place, you figured out these were lenses worn on the eyes pretty quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now that he said it, this might be the first time I came across contact lenses in this world. Although in the world of my past life, everyone used them as a matter of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do with them when you wear them on your eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I asked him curiously. He told me about it as dispassionately as ever, but also thoroughly and politely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...They can visually capture the flow of magic power. This makes it easier to find traces of magic and curses, and to undo them. This can replace rings and wands, and even the chanting of incantations can be omitted to some extent. They&rsquo;re magical tools that can speed up your magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could even be shocked, he simply turned his gaze to the side and an empty bottle by the window shattered. He used that kind of magic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like that. Because, in the future, there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of emphasis on speed in magic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was open-mouthed, staring at the broken bottle.</p>

<p>I was sure he broke it just now, but it was restored to its original state before I knew it. So fast&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-wait a minute, this is incredible. It can cover most of a magician&rsquo;s weaknesses. Who exactly are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unlike me, who only studied for exams, he was considerably ahead of the curve as a magician.</p>

<p>It seemed natural that Nero Pachelbel was the head of our year, but where in the world did he get that skill?</p>

<p>Nero Pachelbel and I stared at each other for a while, probing each other.</p>

<p>On the surface of the lens that covered one of his eyes, there was a steady stream of fine magical formulas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a big deal...I&rsquo;ve been in another country for a long time, and I&rsquo;ve just had a lot of opportunities to come in contact with cutting-edge magic. My magic power isn&rsquo;t actually all that high, and I&rsquo;m not that talented. Compared to someone like you who comes from a noble family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! This is a great weapon that we don&rsquo;t have in the Ruschia-style&rsquo;s old fashioned and antiquated magic! I mean, it&rsquo;s way beyond the scope of a student.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that this was a field that the classic magicians of Ruschia hated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all! I&rsquo;m very interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero Pachelbel still had a strange look on his face.</p>

<p>He might be put off by me acting too excited.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Ahem. By the way, it seems that you didn&rsquo;t show up to the spirit summoning ceremony. What&rsquo;s wrong? Did you have a stomach ache or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At any rate, I tried changing the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Why do you care about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;I'm curious. Do you not want to use spirits?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not really. I just didn&rsquo;t want to go since I&rsquo;m already using a spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh, where is it!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To think that he already had a spirit, just like Lapis. Should I say, &ldquo;as expected of the head of the class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I looked all around, Nero Pachelbel languidly walked over to the window and pointed through the wide glass pane to the sky.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A handsome hawk was flying circles in the sky. I see, so his familiar was a hawk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so cool. We have a crow in my family. Bird spirits watch over their masters in the sky, and they&rsquo;re so carefree and wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Well. I&rsquo;m a little jealous of their freedom to go anywhere they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p> For this once, Nero Pachelbel had a gentle expression on his face.</p>

<p>He was about to return to his work table, but I grabbed his shoulder and told him I wasn&rsquo;t letting him go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Have you already been scouted by a team? I&rsquo;m currently recruiting team members.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero Pachelbel suddenly looked nervous and averted his gaze to the side as he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking about that? ...Beatrice Asta invited me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you accept!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was certainly strange that Beatrice, who was looking for the best people, didn&rsquo;t invite him first of all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No...She condescendingly told me, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a commoner, but I&rsquo;ll make you a member of my team. Be thankful and accept it,&rsquo; so I rejected her. I hate arrogant magicians like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could vividly imagine the scene. Even though Nero Pachelbel, the head of our class, was in a position to choose his own team members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand how you feel. My ancestor was quite a wicked person, so people would say all sorts of things about us. In the first place, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to magicians if you&rsquo;re a noble, a commoner, or even a slave. It should all be based on merit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that there were magicians who value bloodline above everything else, but if you asked me, that was ridiculous.</p>

<p>There were geniuses who came from slavery, like Thor, and I was always shown how incredible they were, and I constantly got taken down a peg. Pedigree was meaningless in front of a genius like that.</p>

<p>The same goes for Nero Pachelbel. There was no doubt he was a different kind of genius than Thor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So why don&rsquo;t you team up with me? No...that&rsquo;s not it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I immediately changed that invitation and held out my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, why don&rsquo;t we become friends, Nero Pachelbel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the open skylight, the salty sea breeze and the scent of lemons drifted in on the wind.</p>

<p>There was a moment of refreshing silence. He stared at my held out hand with a surprisingly listless look on his face.</p>

<p>But he didn&rsquo;t shake it readily.</p>

<p>The emptiness of my hand that I held out to him...While making rock and paper* with my hand, trying to gloss things over,</p>

<p> (TN: The Japanese term here is &#12464;&#12540;&#12497;&#12540;, which is a combination of &quot;rock&quot; or guu and &quot;paper&quot; or paa. So basically she's clenching and unclenching her hand.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;W-well...It&rsquo;s true that I&rsquo;m a leftover who nobody wants as a team member because I summoned two dwarf hamsters at the spirit summoning ceremony, but&#8230; Oh! But hamsters are cute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Hamsters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his gaze towards the space I had been working at earlier.</p>

<p>There was a rectangular box made of lumber and glass panes, which I had just finished making.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that the hamster cage you were making?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Yes. I want to make a big one and make them comfortable. I also want a hamster wheel, but I don&rsquo;t really know how to make one. Maybe I should make a hole in a wash basin and try installing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two ham-chans in my robe pocket rustled out, jumped onto the desk in front of them, and started sumo wrestling each other.</p>

<p>They were springy and rolling around and so cute that I dashed out to get the sunflower seeds I just bought and made a wrestling ring around them.</p>

<p>Nero Pachelbel stared at our actions intently&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I&rsquo;ll help you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh? For what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the hamster wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;What!? It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s okay. You have your own work to do, didn&rsquo;t you? I'd be grateful even if you just joined my team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;When did you decide I&rsquo;ll be a part of your team&#8230;? Well, I guess it&rsquo;s fine. I was thinking I had to join one soon anyways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pumped my fist. Nero Pachelbel, on the other hand, let out a small sigh, stopped his work, and went to look at the cage I was partway building.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh, you built this cage pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may not look like it, but I&rsquo;m good at making things. I live in the middle of nowhere, so I had to go and get materials and make everything myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was mostly with things from the Salt Forest.</p>

<p>Although, since I never had the opportunity to make a hamster wheel, it was a struggle.</p>

<p>Nero Pachelbel seemed to be good at that sort of thing, making full use of his tools and magic, and created a beautiful hamster wheel that looked like an item for sale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Nero Pachelbel! Ah...hey, it&rsquo;s a bother to call you by your full name, so can I just call you Nero?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent for a few seconds, and then answered shortly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good name. It sounds like an evil emperor. Or like you&rsquo;d have Patrache* with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p> (TN: Patrache is the dog in the popular story A Dog of Flanders. His owner's name is Nello.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, just talking to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...What about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should I call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nero turned towards me again and asked matter-of-factly while staring at me with his eyes where one was magenta-colored.</p>

<p>Despite his cool tone, the color was so passionate, and I felt some sort of premonition, but,</p>

<p>&ldquo;..., call me Makia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered as though bouncing back in reaction and held out my hand again.</p>

<p>I was a little happy that he intended to call me by my name.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This time, Nero properly shook my hand.</p>

<p></p>

<p> &ldquo;Lapis, listen to this! The head of our class in our team...oh, she&rsquo;s not here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I returned to the girls&rsquo; dorm with the cage I had just built and wanted to tell my roommate Lapis about my day, but she still hadn&rsquo;t returned to our room yet.</p>

<p>Only her familiar, the black cat Noah, came to my feet while meowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are your new roommate hams. Don&rsquo;t eat them, okay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I showed the two to Noah, he sniffed them and licked them.</p>

<p>The ham-chans didn&rsquo;t seem scared, and in fact they climbed onto Noah and began to play, using his smooth furry back as a slide. How bold&#8230;</p>

<p>I immediately laid down shredded paper as flooring in the glass cage, and then put in the bed, food dish, sandbox, and hamster wheel. When I put the playing ham-chans in, the two looked all around first, and then started rolling around in the sandbox and spinning on the hamster wheel.</p>

<p>Looking at them like this, they really only looked like ordinary hamsters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mmm, Popoloactus and Dontanates are too long to say and not cute at all. I think Popotarou and Donsuke will do. Yep, that&rsquo;s cute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had taken the names given to them by my ancestor the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch,&rsquo; and turned into very crude nicknames.</p>

<p>The white one was Popotarou. His attribute was&#12304;Water&#12305;, and he was round and fat.</p>

<p>The yellow one was Donsuke. His attribute was&#12304;Fire&#12305;, and he was small and nimble.</p>

<p>I had no idea how they would help me as spirits, but I was quite grateful for the fact that they had two attributes:&#12304;Water&#12305;, my weakness, and&#12304;Fire&#12305;, my strength.</p>

<p>Ah, I guess they were tired.</p>

<p>They flattened as though they had melted, and fell asleep on top of each other on the hamster wheel.</p>
