<h2>Chapter 10: Chairman of the Japan Dungeon Association</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#9671;Aya&rsquo;s Perspective&#9671;</strong></p>

<p>I was nervous.</p>

<p>In such a situation, I was very nervous.</p>

<p>Until a while ago, I was very scared. I thought, &ldquo;Am I going to die like this?</p>

<p>Will I be manipulated by them and spend the rest of my life as a sexual outlet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought alone made me shiver with fear.</p>

<p>But now it&rsquo;s different.</p>

<p>I feel relieved.</p>

<p>But more than that, my heart is pounding, throbbing intensely.</p>

<p>Even though I feel like I could scream, I am not allowed to let go of this hand.</p>

<p>For the first time, I held a man tightly with my own strength.</p>

<p>His scent was nice and his&#8230; solid chest made my heart race.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on a little tighter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hugged him tightly, my face so hot it felt like it was boiling.</p>

<p>Despite not wanting to be seen, I buried my face in his chest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only after burying myself that I realized how much more embarrassing that act was.</p>

<p>This person is mean.</p>

<p>No, I understand that there is no other way.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m convinced, and in fact, I can only be grateful.</p>

<p>But still, to a woman, met for the first time today, to me, who has never dated a man.</p>

<p>In a situation where I can&rsquo;t refuse, he orders me to hold him tightly.</p>

<p>And I obediently obeyed that order.</p>

<p>If this had happened before, I would have been furious at being ordered around by others.</p>

<p>But now, I don&rsquo;t feel bad at all.</p>

<p>Rather&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>And the two, who had defeated the boss, were enveloped in particles of light and transported outside the Cube.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, welcome back&#9472;&#9472;!? Ryuenji-san!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the guards outside were about to rejoice at the return of the dungeon clearers, they were flustered at the return of the worn-out clearer and only Ryuenji-san.</p>

<p>When the dungeon boss is defeated, all humans inside are transported.</p>

<p>In other words, these two were the only survivors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amachi-san! Amachi-san! &#8230;You guys hurry up, take him to the hospital! And arrange for an excellent healing magician!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? What&#8230; what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up! Don&rsquo;t make me say it twice!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the sound of sirens, Kai and Aya Ryuenji were carried away.</p>

<p>&#9671;Kai&rsquo;s Perspective</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Where is this? &#8230;Ah, it&rsquo;s the usual ceiling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked around as I woke up on the bed.</p>

<p>Judging from the IV in my arm, I&rsquo;m probably in a hospital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uhm, let&rsquo;s call a nurse first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as I was about to press the nurse call button, I heard the sound of a door opening, and I looked in that direction.</p>

<p>I guess she changed the water in the vase, because Ryuenji-san was holding a vase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m glad&#8230; huh! You&rsquo;re awake, Kai Amachi-san. How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san, who showed me an incredibly adorable smile.</p>

<p>However, she cleared her throat in an instant and her expression changed to a serious one, it was a bit funny how quickly her expression changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m a bit dizzy&#8230; huh? My shoulder is healed too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We arranged for an excellent healing magician. There should be no problem with your wounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, that&rsquo;s good&#8230; Is it already night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I looked outside the window, it was already dark.</p>

<p>I must have been asleep from noon until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kai-kun!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I guess he heard that I was awake, because Tanaka-san came running to the hospital room.</p>

<p>I wonder if he was waiting in another room, he&rsquo;s still in his suit, so he must have just finished work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Tanaka-san. Back in the hospital again, I&rsquo;m always here, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made a light joke and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard most of it from Ryuenji-san. I&rsquo;m really sorry for putting you in such danger. I also heard about Masuda and the others. I never thought the God-destroying Church would appear in Japan&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s not your fault, Tanaka-san, and I&rsquo;m glad I was there. Otherwise, Ryuenji-san would have been killed. I&rsquo;m glad I was able to protect her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you really helped, I&rsquo;m deeply grateful. I&rsquo;ll thank you again separately&#8230; So, I received a call from my grandfather about this earlier&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandfather? The chairman of the Dungeon Association, you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my grandfather, Kagetora Ryuenji. He wants to meet you&#8230; Is tomorrow around noon, okay? My grandfather was in the U.S. for a World Dungeon Association meeting, but he said he can come back as soon as tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, understood. That&rsquo;s fine, I have some things I want to tell him too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I agreed to the proposal.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t plan to go into the dungeon today or tomorrow, and I have some questions to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will also be present, Kai-kun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Tanaka-san whispered in my ear so that only I could hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might need to talk about your eyes. Chairman Kagetora is a trustworthy person. I guarantee it. He should be on our side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded quietly.</p>

<p>If Tanaka-san says he can be trusted, I trust him.</p>

<p>I trust Tanaka-san that much.</p>

<p>Maybe because we&rsquo;re comrades who have risked our lives together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um, Amachi-san, I also have some things I&rsquo;d like to ask you&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ryuenji-san spoke to me in a slightly embarrassed manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything&#8230; tomorrow. Can you wait until then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y-Yes! I&rsquo;ve waited 18 years. One more day is not a problem. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re tired, so I&rsquo;ll leave for today. I&rsquo;ll send a car to pick you up tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, Ryuenji-san seemed to be leaving for the day.</p>

<p>I thought she might be scared after what happened today, but a car came to pick her up, and men dressed in black appeared in the hospital room.</p>

<p>It seems that as the granddaughter of the chairman, she can receive protection from the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>She is called a &lsquo;young lady&rsquo;, but everyone is a staff member of the Dungeon Association. However, because many people have been indebted to the chairman, they seem to pour love on his granddaughter.</p>

<p>I definitely don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s because she is a beauty, setting aside ones with happy expressions like Masuda-san&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Kai-kun. You must be tired today, so I&rsquo;m going. I&rsquo;d like you to tell me various things tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since I woke up, I was hungry so I decided to go and buy some food. Then, I opened my smartphone and decided to research that organization.</p>

<p>&#8810;God-Destruction Cult&#8811;</p>

<p>The last face of the man named Phu Yen still lingers in my head, so I looked up the God-Destruction Cult, which I knew mostly from the news.</p>

<p>As a result, a number of painful incidents quickly caught my search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A global terrorist group, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The God-Destruction Cult seemed to be treated as a terrorist.</p>

<p>They seem to be advocating killing God and liberating the world, but the details of their purpose don&rsquo;t seem to be well understood.</p>

<p>However, there are some things that are understood.</p>

<p>There are many followers, and the number is said to be nearly ten thousand.</p>

<p>All of them are composed of top awakeners, and even the lowest rank is C-Rank or higher.</p>

<p>There are also monsters called S-Rank archbishops included, and the existence called the leader as well as founder is said to surpass that.</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s largest criminal syndicate, and its founder is the worst criminal wanted worldwide.</p>

<p>Their main activities seem to be abroad, but they seem to have a grudge against dungeon associations all over the world.</p>

<p>A mysterious terrorist group advocating the overthrow of the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>Because of this, granddaughter, Aya Ryuenji, an S-Rank was targeted. Under the special conditions of a dungeon where the world&rsquo;s strongest bodyguard, the chairman, is not present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s going to be targeted from now on&#8230; I have to do something about it. And about the artifacts too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know Ryuenji-san&rsquo;s occupation. Artifacter, I guess it&rsquo;s the ability to create artifacts.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it refers to, but I think it has a power that distinguishes it from equipment made by refining magic power.</p>

<p>Because usually, equipment increases a fixed ability.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s something I learned by looking at the equipment I&rsquo;ve seen so far, all the equipment has things like the ability to increase attack power.</p>

<p>Although this itself is probably not widely known by people, except for me, who can&rsquo;t see statuses, everyone knows it by feeling.</p>

<p>But&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is it&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I look at the broken magic stone in my pocket.</p>

<p>The artifact created by Ryuenji-san, it increased my intelligence by 25%.</p>

<p>To be clear, the performance is too extraordinary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this power can make weapons, and there&rsquo;s no time limit&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt an enormous potential in Ryuenji-san&rsquo;s power.</p>

<p>So, I want her to be able to handle it well.</p>

<p>I saved her life, maybe she&rsquo;ll make a weapon for me as a way of saying thank you.</p>

<p>With a faint expectation in my heart, I closed the screen of my smartphone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For now, let&rsquo;s talk about everything tomorrow. The chairman, huh? He&rsquo;s a high and mighty person&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lie down on the bed again. The person I&rsquo;m meeting tomorrow is the chairman, the highest-ranking person who runs Japan&rsquo;s dungeons. His name is Kagetora Ryuenji, and he has a past as a representative clearer of Japan.</p>

<p>If just guessing, he could have as much influence as Japan&rsquo;s Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Dungeon Association is an independent global organization separate from politics.</p>

<p>But its power can control the world.</p>

<p>The representative of Japan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s a nice person&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>The following day.</p>



<p>I left the hospital in a car sent to pick me up.</p>



<p>We were heading to the Ryuenji household. I had imagined a large house, but&#8230;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Guided by an Association staff, I arrived at a location slightly off from the center of Tokyo, but still within the Tokyo city limits.</p>



<p>And then I saw it.</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Europe?&rdquo;</p>



<p>It looked just like a castle in Europe.</p>



<p>A huge fountain and a large white Western-style building towering behind it.</p>



<p>There were beautiful tulips blooming in what looked more like a garden than a yard.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a mansion. Unmistakably a mansion&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>I didn&rsquo;t know how large the property was, but the house resembled a state guesthouse.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah, Amachi-san!&rdquo;</p>



<p>While I was overwhelmed by the height of the gate, which seemed to be about three meters tall, Ryuenji-san spotted me and ran over from inside.</p>



<p>Her face lit up with a bright smile, which was really cute, but as she got closer, she straightened her face.</p>



<p>I thought to myself, &lsquo;As usual, she&rsquo;s quite adept, even though her smile is cuter.&rsquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you; my grandfather should be arriving soon&#8230; What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>





<p>I was a bit captivated for a moment.</p>



<p>Yesterday, because of the dungeon expedition, she was dressed very sporty, but today was different.</p>





<p>She wore a tight black outfit with a miniskirt.</p>



<p>I think this style is known as &lsquo;girly.&rsquo;</p>



<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know what it is, try searching &#12302;girly style young lady&#12303;and you&rsquo;ll get the idea.</p>





<p>Her beautiful, shapely legs extending from her black miniskirt would surely captivate any healthy male.</p>



<p>If there was a skill called &lsquo;Virgin Killer,&rsquo; she seemed like she might have it, so I checked her status. Well, she didn&rsquo;t.</p>



<p>But she was that beautiful.</p>



<p>As my eyes were naturally drawn to her, I inadvertently blurted out, &ldquo;You look different from yesterday&#8230; you&rsquo;re very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;!?&#8230; Oh, thank you.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Ryuenji-san turned her back to me as she thanked me.</p>



<p>She seemed a bit embarrassed, but I&rsquo;ve been taught that women should be praised.</p>



<p>&ldquo;T-Tanaka-san is already waiting inside. I&rsquo;ll show you in.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Alright, understood!&rdquo;</p>



<p>After that, Ryuenji-san didn&rsquo;t look my way at all.</p>





<p>I was led into the mansion.</p>



<p>The interior was just as grand as the exterior, with a modern Western look completely different from the outside.</p>



<p>However, there seemed to be a particular attention to detail in the interior design. It looked incredibly expensive.</p>



<p>&ldquo;What a stylish house.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;My grandmother loved it. I was also influenced by her&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Ryuenji-san &lsquo;s grandmother passed away.</p>



<p>But she lived a full life and passed away peacefully due to old age, so although it was sad, Ryuenji-san talked about it with a smile.</p>





<p>&ldquo;This is it. I&rsquo;ll prepare some tea now.&rdquo;</p>





<p>With that, Ryuenji-san left the room.</p>



<p>I thought there might be maids or something, but it seemed that wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>



<p>However, she mentioned that a cleaning company comes to clean the house once a week.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Oh, there you are. Are you feeling better now?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Tanaka-san!&rdquo;</p>





<p>I was led to what could be described as a reception room.</p>



<p>The room, with its large sofa and noble-like design, was stylish and unified in a Western style.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Yes! I&rsquo;m used to transfusions now!&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Hmm, that&rsquo;s not something to be proud of.&rdquo;</p>





<p>We laughed a little together. Tea and what looked like cookies were served.</p>



<p>Tanaka-san and Ryuenji-san, enjoying the expensive-looking tea and sweets elegantly, seemed to go together very well.</p>





<p>I gorged on the cookies like it was a meal. You have to eat when you can.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Did you find it to your liking?&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Oh&#8230; I&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s been a while since I had sweets and they&rsquo;re so delicious that I just&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty more, feel free to have as much as you like.&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Speaking of which, Aya-kun, where is Kagetora-san?&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;He should be arriving soon&#8230; He said he would run over here as fast as possible from Narita.&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Haha&#8230; he&rsquo;s as unpredictable as ever.&rdquo;</p>





<p>Just then&#8230;</p>





<p>BANG!</p>





<p>&ldquo;Aya!! I&rsquo;m back!! Going all out from Narita was a bit tiring!&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Welcome back. Should we go greet him?&rdquo;</p>





<p>At the loud voice echoing throughout the house, we all got up and headed towards the entrance.</p>



<p>There stood a buff elderly man who looked nothing like he was in his seventies.</p>



<p>His physique was as muscular as the turtle hermit in the anime where they gather seven balls.</p>





<p>He was wearing shorts, an aloha shirt that suited him well, and sunglasses.</p>



<p>His hair was dyed blonde, and he had a fashionable look that seemed to defy his age in every way.</p>





<p>Visible scars on all of his exposed limbs told a story of a battle-hardened veteran.</p>





<p>He reminded me of the boss in a yakuza manga &ndash; intimidating, yet his face was friendly.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Welcome back, Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>





<p>Then, Kagetora-san gently stroked Ryuenji-san &lsquo;s head with his large hand.</p>



<p>His hand was so large that it completely enveloped her small head.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Aya&#8230; I heard about it on the phone, I&rsquo;m glad to see you&rsquo;re okay&#8230; Oh? Tanaka-kun is here too. It&rsquo;s been a while!&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while, although I came to say hello at New Year&rsquo;s, so it hasn&rsquo;t even been a year yet.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Haha, is that so? Then&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Kai Amachi&#8230; Nice to meet you!&rdquo;</p>



<p>The muscular old man slowly walked towards me. He took off his sunglasses, and his piercing gaze shot through me.</p>



<p>But soon, Kagetora-san lowered his head.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Nice to meet you. I&rsquo;m Kagetora Ryuenji, the President of the Japan Dungeon Association. First of all, I&rsquo;d like to express my deepest gratitude for helping Aya. Normally, I&rsquo;d have been nearby. I was caught off guard. If it weren&rsquo;t for you, Aya might have died. Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;I merely&#8230; fulfilled my duty as her guard&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;No, I heard that you risked your life to protect her. You even sustained injuries severe enough to lose consciousness while facing A-Rank Phu Yen. I cannot thank you enough. Thank you, Kai-kun.&rdquo;</p>





<p>The chairman, contrary to his stature, bowed his head deeply.</p>



<p>From his attitude, I could tell that he was not a bad person.</p>



<p>Even though I haven&rsquo;t lived that long, I could somehow tell this person was good.</p>





<p>He was polite to me, despite me being significantly younger and holding no position.</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Understood. I accept it. You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>





<p>Then, Chairman Kagetora lifted his face and smiled.</p>





<p>I was also taken in by his smile, how reassuring he was.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Grandpa! So, how about we have lunch here! What would you like?&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m really hungry after that run. Well, I&rsquo;d like sushi! Order special stuff! Enough for ten people.&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Hehe, understood.&rdquo;</p>



<p>We returned to the reception room.</p>





<p>Only Ryuenji-san went to order sushi, probably a delivery.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Kagetora-san, considering your age, you should have taken it easy and driven&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while, so I&rsquo;m winded. But it was the fastest way. I wanted to see Aya quickly, and you guys too. So, let&rsquo;s get down to business before Aya comes back.&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Yes, from what I heard from Aya and from an immediate investigation of the Cube by the research team yesterday, it seems to be none other than Phu Yen, a bishop of the God-Destruction cult, or in other words, an A-Rank Awakened. A globally wanted assassin who has killed many prominent figures, I didn&rsquo;t expect such a big shot to be in Japan. Even I only knew his name&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;I see&#8230; he was highly alert within the association&#8230; and he was defeated by Kai-kun, an unranked. Can you explain that? Or is it a secret? We&rsquo;re the ones who got the help. If it&rsquo;s a secret&#8230; you don&rsquo;t have to tell.&rdquo;</p>





<p>Tanaka-san looks at me.</p>



<p>I nodded and decided to speak.</p>





<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll talk, and there&rsquo;s something I want to tell you about Ryuenji-san&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s vow to not disclose anything heard here.&rdquo;</p>





<p>We sat at the table facing each other.</p>



<p>With determination, I started speaking.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Thank you. So, Chairman Kagetora&#8230; I can see the status of people who have magic power. What kind of power they have, what abilities they possess. This is the power I gained by conquering the Golden Cube.&rdquo;</p>





<p>Chairman Kagetora also knows that I&rsquo;m the conqueror of the Golden Cube.</p>



<p>But he knows nothing about this Eye of God that I got as a result.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Status? What does that mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be faster if I showed you.&rdquo;</p>





<p>I took out a paper and pen, just like when I was with Tanaka-san.</p>



<p>I smoothly wrote down what appeared in this eye.</p>





<p>I put the paper on the table.</p>



<p>The kindly smiling chairman suddenly opened his eyes wide when he saw it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is your status, Chairman Kagetora.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>&ldquo;This is the status of Chairman Kagetora.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;</p>

<p>Name:&#12288;Kagetora Ryuenji</p>

<p>Status: Good</p>

<p>Job: Berserker &#12304;Advanced&#12305;</p>

<p>Skill(s): Pain Inhibition, Natural Healing</p>

<p>Magic Power: 284,300</p>

<p>Attack Power: Reflection rate&#9654; 100% = 284,300</p>

<p>Defense Power: Reflection rate&#9654; 25% = 71,075</p>

<p>Agility: Reflection rate&#9654; 25% = 71,075</p>

<p>Intelligence: Reflection rate&#9654; 25% = 71,075</p>



<p>Equipment:</p>

<p>&#12539;None</p>

<p>&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;&#8722;</p>



<p>I show him the status I&rsquo;ve written down.</p>

<p>And then I think to myself, this guy really is a muscle head.</p>

<p>Just as his appearance suggests, he&rsquo;s a berserker, pouring all of his job&rsquo;s reflection rate increase into his attack power.</p>



<p>My novice knight (light) class has a 25% increase in both attack power and intelligence.</p>

<p>However, a berserker has a 75% increase in attack power.</p>

<p>This is just speculation, but I think beginner classes get a total of 50%, advanced classes get 75%, and perhaps Aya&rsquo;s awakened gives a 100% increase.</p>



<p>He also has skills like Pain Inhibition and Natural Healing.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder he&rsquo;s strong, while ignoring pain, with simple strength, continue to fight, and even recover while doing so.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re aware of magic power, as is Tanaka-kun, but&#8230; the skill, Pain Inhibition, I thought it was due to my unique physical constitution&#8230; only my colleagues from my active-duty days should know about it. Well, even then, if you ask&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Chairman Kagetora&rdquo;</p>



<p>Tanaka-san calls out to the chairman who is troubledly looking at the paper.</p>

<p>He then looks him in the eye and nods.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe, but let&rsquo;s trust it. This is information that Kai-kun could not know. This is the secret to your strength?&rdquo;</p>



<p>I also explain about the Cubes.</p>

<p>Chairman Kagetora reacted similarly to Tanaka-san, but he was convinced with Tanaka-san&rsquo;s support.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Who knows about this?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Only Tanaka-san and the Chairman.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I see&#8230; understood. I swear not to speak of it again. But this makes sense, that you, an unranked Kai-kun, grew enough to fight an A-Rank.&rdquo;</p>



<p>But I deny it.</p>



<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not it. I could never have won on my own. I&rsquo;m currently a mid-level B-Rank. I won because of Aya-san&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Aya&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that moment, Aya-san returns from placing her order.</p>

<p>The chairman shuts his mouth on the spot, but I intended to tell Aya-san everything.</p>

<p>Because I want her to create an artifact.</p>



<p>If she was evil, I wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing, but I think she&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>Just a desperate girl struggling as her powerless self.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Aya-san, can you sit down? There&rsquo;s something I want to talk about.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Eh!? Uh, Ay&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Chairman Kagetora is here too&#8230; Is it okay if I call you by your first name? Or&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah! I see. That&rsquo;s fine&#8230; Aya is no problem. And you don&rsquo;t need to use honorifics, Amachi-san, since we&rsquo;re the same age.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230; got it, Aya. So, will you join us?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Aya?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ye, Yes!&rdquo;</p>



<p>Aya, blushing and shy, maybe she&rsquo;s not used to being called by her first name.</p>

<p>Well, we were complete strangers until yesterday, that can&rsquo;t be helped.</p>



<p>Chairman Kagetora and Tanaka-san start whispering.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ta, Tanaka-kun&#8230; could it be&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so, surprisingly he&rsquo;s a bit of a natural flirt.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Tanaka-san, Chairman Kagetora?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare start calling me grandpa yet!&rdquo;</p>



<p>(Are they talking about age? Sure, he&rsquo;s old enough to be a grandpa, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be right to treat him as an old man.)</p>



<p>&ldquo;Amachi-san, may I also call you Kai-san?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Hm? Sure. Now let&rsquo;s get back to the topic. About Aya&rsquo;s status&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>I gaze at Aya as I start writing down her status on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Aya is twirling her hair with her fingers, avoiding eye contact, but she looked just like a model for a painting.</p>

<p>Just sitting there, she&rsquo;s so beautiful that it makes me appreciate her beauty all over again.</p>



<p>&ldquo;The reflection rate for everything other than intelligence is 0, I believe this is the cause. And Aya, you have the power to create special equipment called artifacts. This equipment influences a number called reflection rate written in this status.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;What&#8230; even Aya&rsquo;s status&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I show Chairman Kagetora and Aya their status and explain it.</p>

<p>Aya is surprised, but she understands quickly.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s smart, she learns ten things when she hears one.</p>



<p>&ldquo;So, this is my power&#8230; my very own special power&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Chairman Kagetora then places his hand on Aya&rsquo;s head and strokes it gently.</p>



<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you&rsquo;re not incompetent.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Yes&#8230; yes&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Chairman Kagetora, comforting Aya, I don&rsquo;t know what kind of life she&rsquo;s led, having been called a useless S-Rank.</p>

<p>But I think I understand the feeling of being called useless.</p>

<p>No matter how hard you try, you&rsquo;re crushed like a bug in front of the talent of inborn magic power.</p>



<p>I had accepted it there, but she probably didn&rsquo;t, and kept fighting.</p>



<p>I respect her a little for proving that she&rsquo;s not incompetent, and for all the effort she&rsquo;s put in.</p>



<p>&ldquo;So, I don&rsquo;t fully understand this ability myself, but&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>I present the A-Rank magical stone and the artifact Aya created for me.</p>

<p>The red, round stone is neatly broken in the middle.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a magic stone, used to create things. Aya, it&rsquo;s broken, but I&rsquo;ll give it back. Can you remember anything from this?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thank you. It&rsquo;s broken&#8230; but it saved my life, didn&rsquo;t it? I have some ideas about why that special power came out at that time&#8230; I have a few things in mind, so I&rsquo;ll run some tests.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I nod.</p>

<p>Aya, just like a researcher, will probably recreate the situation at that time in great detail and find the cause.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Call me when it&rsquo;s done, I can tell what abilities the artifact has. I can&rsquo;t tell the details right now though&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Understood! I&rsquo;ll try various things. Now that I&rsquo;ve been proven to have power, I can see a straight path ahead of me instead of walking ahead blind.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Well, that&rsquo;s all I have to say&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thank you for talking to us, Kai-san. I will stay by Aya&rsquo;s side for a while, no one can harm her easily when I&rsquo;m around.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much for everything, Kai-san. Once I&rsquo;ve mastered this power, if it&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;d like you to accept an artifact.&rdquo;</p>



<p>(Alright!)</p>



<p>I secretly made a victory pose in my heart to those words. Honestly, there was little resistance saying it out loud.</p>



<p>Perhaps the value of the artifact is beyond billions. It&rsquo;s uncertain what actions major nations will take to seek its power.</p>



<p>I hate to put it this way, but Aya&rsquo;s power is a weapon in this modern era. It&rsquo;s a force that could disrupt the world&rsquo;s power balance. If it can be mass-produced, the world will change.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I think both of you understand&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Yes, I won&rsquo;t tell anyone about Aya-san&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me neither, Chairman Kagetora.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Aya&rsquo;s power will remain a secret, just like my power. We then talked about the future.</p>



<p>&ldquo;So, Kai-san. You&rsquo;re planning to solo the C-Rank dungeon?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I want to.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I conveyed that I want to continue solo raiding. My partner is the chairman of the dungeon association, so to speak, he&rsquo;s the one who has to strictly follow these rules. I might even lose my qualification here.</p>



<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Originally, the dungeon point system was created to prevent powerless clearers from dying. Although it has now become a rule, it was initially our standard created while many people were dying in dungeons. It means that one should have at least that much combat power to challenge a dungeon. But you have a reason you have to do this, don&rsquo;t you? I won&rsquo;t stop you then. There are many things in this world that should be prioritized over rules. However!&rdquo;</p>



<p>Chairman Kagetora puts his finger on his mouth and winks.</p>



<p>&ldquo;This is a secret, okay? After all, I am the chairman.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ha ha, understood.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad. Now I can search for a treatment for AMS.&rdquo;</p>



<p>I clenched my fist and made a victory pose. I&rsquo;m one step closer to waking up Nagi.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Kai-san&#8230; before that, could you come out to the garden for a bit?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Then Chairman Kagetora looks at me with a smile.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a match.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Just like a little kid.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Come at me whenever you&rsquo;re ready! Give it your all!&rdquo;</p>



<p>Before me stood a bodybuilder like man, clad in a Hawaiian shirt.</p>



<p>&ldquo;So, I can go all out, right?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ha, it&rsquo;s about time you got to know my skills. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to thrust your sword with the intent to harm. If you can, that is.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ha, right.&rdquo;</p>



<p>With a dry chuckle, I knew I stood no chance against him.</p>

<p>But with faith in the chairman, I clutched my sword and ran towards him.</p>



<p>I raced across the ground with all my might, my speed surpassing the previously known limits of humankind in a blink, outpacing cars and flying like a missile.</p>



<p>My downward stroke of the sword was evaded with a willowy agility that belied his hulking figure.</p>



<p>&ldquo;How about that! I&rsquo;m already over 70, you know?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Nobody in their 70s moves like that!&rdquo;</p>



<p>My continuously dodged sword infuriated me. His casual parries felt like he was mocking me.</p>

<p>A mere flick of his finger could alter the course of my sword. Then, from behind, I received a flick on my forehead.</p>

<p>Just a flick, yet it had enough power to send me flying. The pain was intense&#8230;</p>



<p>I immersed myself in the brief exchange.</p>

<p>As my concentration peaked, my eyes&#8230;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Oh&#8230; is that the Eye of God? What a grand name.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8230;they shone a golden hue.</p>



<p>As we fought, I crafted a strategy.</p>

<p>I knew I couldn&rsquo;t win.</p>

<p>Yet, I was determined to at least land a single blow.</p>



<p>I ran towards Chairman Kagetora, using my body to conceal my sword.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Those are indeed good eyes&#8230; pure and focused.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The chairman stood poised like a karate expert, stamping his feet.</p>

<p>His magic power release made the air vibrate and the plants sway.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>



<p>My sword was raised, then brought down.</p>

<p>The chairman&rsquo;s gaze was fixed on the sword I was supposed to be holding in my hands.</p>



<p>&ldquo;!?&rdquo;</p>



<p>But the sword was missing.</p>

<p>Shocked, he lifted his arm in defense against the expected sword strike, encased in a magic armor.</p>

<p>But he felt nothing.</p>



<p>&ldquo;What the!?&rdquo;</p>



<p>This was my Mirage, an invisible flash that only lasts a moment when there&rsquo;s such a great disparity in magic power.</p>

<p>The chairman would soon see through the trick, even if I concealed my body.</p>

<p>The trick would be pointless if he created a distance.</p>



<p>So, I only made the sword invisible.</p>

<p>Just for a split second.</p>



<p>The chairman, who thought he had successfully blocked my attack, noticed that I wasn&rsquo;t clutching a sword in my right hand.</p>

<p>Naturally, because my invisible sword was still sheathed at my waist.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;</p>



<p>I landed on the ground and assumed an Iaido like posture, aiming at the unguarded side of Chairman Kagetora.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Well done&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>My sword stroke would land this time.</p>

<p>But at the last moment, the speed of the sword waned.</p>

<p>I frowned; my brows furrowed.</p>



<p>That moment of hesitation gave the chairman ample time.</p>

<p>He had the leeway to deflect my sword with one hand.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Metal?!&rdquo;</p>



<p>His arm felt like solid metal.</p>

<p>Unable to make a dent, I was repelled, and the chairman flicked my forehead again, flipping me over.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ugh!?&rdquo;</p>



<p>As I lay sprawled on the ground, Chairman Kagetora stood above me, placing his finger on my forehead with a smile.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I win. Shall we call it a day?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;I lost&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Chairman Kagetora sat cross-legged next to me, gently patting my head with his large hand.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You put up a splendid fight. You could have struck me down at the end, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been surprising. However&#8230; just as I thought, Kai-kun, do you have the courage to cut a person?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s why my sword slowed down.</p>

<p>If I had carried through with that stroke, I would have killed the chairman.</p>

<p>That momentary doubt made my sword falter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve lived a peaceful life until now, capable of defeating monsters.</p>



<p>But to stab a person, to cut a person, our instincts resist.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>



<p>During the time with Phu, I was desperate, so there was no hesitation.</p>

<p>Many clearers were killed, and I was almost killed.</p>



<p>I could fight without hesitation then, in that frenzied state.</p>



<p>But it&rsquo;s different now, when I&rsquo;m in full control of my mind.</p>

<p>Cutting a person isn&rsquo;t as easy as it seems.</p>

<p>I guess everyone feels the same. Even though dungeons have appeared, it&rsquo;s challenging to kill someone in peaceful Japan.</p>



<p>&ldquo;I see&#8230; that&rsquo;s good. That&rsquo;s normal. But Kai-kun, you&rsquo;re about to step into a world that isn&rsquo;t normal. The power you have brings more power and what it calls towards it is even more power. You&rsquo;ll face life-threatening situations. You can&rsquo;t say you can&rsquo;t stab a person then.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yes, I understand.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;But remember this advice from an old man. Protecting something often means killing someone else. It&rsquo;s two sides of the same coin. So, prepare yourself, Kai-kun. You must have dreams to achieve, people to protect. If so, you need to be prepared to kill a person, an enemy. It&rsquo;s a bloody world. I&rsquo;ve seen lives lost that couldn&rsquo;t be protected with mere ideals. You&rsquo;ve already decided to step into that world.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>His words may have been directed at me, who still felt the weight of killing Phu.</p>

<p>I imagine this is the path the chairman has walked, perhaps he has killed people too.</p>



<p>Could I kill a person when the time comes?</p>

<p>Even if they are not inherently evil, but are my enemy, nonetheless?</p>



<p>As I sank into my troubled thoughts, the chairman continued his words kindly.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Kai-kun, there&rsquo;s one thing you should remember.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;No matter how many people you kill, as long as you have a core within you, something you want to protect, it should guide you in times of doubt. Do you have something you would stake your life to protect?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;My&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>I remember. To save Nagi from AMS.</p>

<p>I would become a villain for that cause.</p>



<p>That&rsquo;s my reason for fighting, the reason I absolutely want to achieve.</p>

<p>It was this desire that saved me in the many times I had come close to death, during the trials of strength, during the battle with the novice knights, and even during the time with Phu.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Do you have something you want to protect, Chairman Kagetora?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Me? Of course, I do. I was born in this country 70 years ago. I&rsquo;ve fought since the times before magic existed. Even now, the thing I want to protect the most is all the citizens living in this country. That includes you, of course.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Seeing the chairman&rsquo;s bright smile, I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile as well.</p>

<p>I lifted my face, looked straight at the chairman, and replied.</p>



<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s incredible, and&#8230; it&rsquo;s cool. I&rsquo;ll prepare myself to be able to protect what I want to protect!&rdquo;</p>



<p>The chairman laughed heartily, and that marked the end of our conversation for the day.</p>

<p>I headed straight home and began preparing for my solo clear of the C-Rank dungeon.</p>



<p>&#9671;</p>



<p>Once Kai had left, only Tanaka and the chairman were left in the room.</p>



<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good kid, isn&rsquo;t he? Kai-kun. I really like him.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Hahaha, it&rsquo;s rare to find a kid like that these days. He fights for his family. But it&rsquo;s the best way to bring out his power, just like Aya did for me.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll become strong. Having a reason to fight makes one strong&#8230; Now, chairman, about the topics for the upcoming World Dungeon Conference&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah, there are two main topics. One is about the God-Destruction cult. They seem to be planning a large-scale operation soon, so we&rsquo;re being warned to be on alert. The countermeasures are left to each country, though it seems a bit negligent. Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped. We don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re up to.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I see. And what&rsquo;s the most important topic at the moment?&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Dragon Island. Apparently, the US is going to act based on the US-Japan Security Treaty as military action. However, China is still opposing it. Territorially, Dragon Island is within our country&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone, but the next closest is China. They might&#8230; force their way in.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult problem. The S-Rank Cube, its rights generate a huge profit. Every country would want it. The magic stone it produces is now equivalent to military power. China wouldn&rsquo;t want the US to get it. We feel the same way.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ideally, we would resolve this within our country and keep the profits here&#8230; but we&rsquo;ve already failed twice. We no longer have excuses to prevent foreign intervention.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Indeed&#8230; It&rsquo;s the only place on this planet where mankind has lost its habitat. It&rsquo;s been two years since the dungeon collapsed, losing three S-Ranks that day.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Yes, the island where the S-Rank dragons strut around. Relying on the power of other countries is&#8230; indeed a painful choice for Japan.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah, the Dragon Island recapture operation will begin soon. Call back the oversears Ryunosuke and Reina.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#9671;Kai&rsquo;s Perspective</p>



<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got a grip on the atmosphere of C-Rank, but to be honest, I can&rsquo;t see myself losing&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>I returned home and looked at the list of C-Rank dungeons I had received from Tanaka-san. I&rsquo;ve been given permission to enter any of them at any time.</p>

<p>The only condition is that I use Mirage to make sure no one knows I&rsquo;m not alone.</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Let&rsquo;s go. I have to get stronger, and then there&rsquo;s the God-Destruction cult&#8230; I&rsquo;ve told Tanaka-san, but they might be targeting me. Or maybe it&rsquo;s about this eye&#8230; And they knew about God&rsquo;s trial. Who are they, really?&rdquo;</p>



<p>But thinking about it is pointless.</p>

<p>Right now, I need to full clear C-Ranks and increase my magical power.</p>



<p>Without further ado, I headed for the nearest C-Rank dungeon.</p>



<p>It was a little out of Tokyo, not quite a city, but there was certainly some foot traffic.</p>



<p>So, I activated my power.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Mirage!&rdquo;</p>



<p>The people passing by didn&rsquo;t notice me. They couldn&rsquo;t recognize me because their intelligence was lower than mine.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being invisible. I could get up to mischief and no one would know. But of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Although I felt a little mischievous, I decided against doing anything illegal.</p>

<p>After a short walk, I arrived at a huge Cube standing majestically in the middle of the town.</p>



<p>The area was cordoned off, but the Cube sparkled like a gem.</p>



<p>Its color was sakura pink. It was as beautiful as a cherry blossom, making me feel a bit happy just by looking at it.</p>

<p>However, what was inside was far from cute; it was definitely a monster capable of killing most of mankind.</p>



<p>C-Rank was something beyond most of humanity.</p>

<p>If it were the past me, I would&rsquo;ve been dead in a second. But now&#8230;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Alright, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>



<p>With a clear sound, I stepped into the C-Rank cube.</p>

<p>There was no fear, no terror, all that remained was the throbbing of excitement in my chest.</p>



<p>I started to clear C-Rank cubes one after another.</p>



<p>Preparing for the battle that will surely come one day.</p>
