<h2>Final Chapter: I Want to Be Your Main Heroine</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p> <br />I’ve been feeling a strange gaze.<br /> <br />It all started a week ago.<br /> <br />Since the day we had lunch on the rooftop, I started sensing eyes on me more often.<br /> <br />However, every time I turned around to identify the source, there was either no one or too many people, making it impossible to pinpoint.<br /> <br />Not knowing what it was, I began to seriously wonder if I had been possessed by a ghost.<br /> <br />Despite trying various methods to exorcise evil spirits that I found on the internet,<br /> <br />there was no sign of improvement.<br /> <br />“It’s that! That’s it!”<br /> <br />“Huh? Wh-what is it?”<br /> <br />Today, during break, as I pondered if there was any effective way to exorcise evil spirits, I saw my childhood friend reading a book, and it hit me.<br /> <br />(Yes, let’s go to the library.)<br /> <br />I remembered entering the library once during class,<br /> <br />I remember it from the class I attended once; Seira High School is not only spacious in terms of the campus and grounds but also has a large library.<br /> <br />I heard they had a collection of a hundred thousand books, so I thought I might find one or two books on exorcism.<br /> <br />“That’s why I want you to go home first after school today.<br /> <br />“Why? I have no idea what’s going on.”<br /> <br />Without waiting for my childhood friend to catch up, I unilaterally declared this, deciding to research alone after school.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Time passed, and after school arrived.<br /> <br />As planned, Saito arrived at the library.<br /> <br />“Whoa, there are so many books. Let’s start with the old ones.”<br /> <br />“Oops!”<br /> <br />As he entered, he was overwhelmed by the pressure of a hundred thousand books, but determined to find a book on spirits, he began his search. Suddenly, he collided with a certain girl.<br /> <br />“Sorry, Kanzaki. Are you okay?”<br /> <br />“No big deal.”<br /> <br />The girl he bumped into was Kanzaki Minaka, a friend of Lily.<br /> <br />Despite offering a hand to help her up, she naturally ignored it, seemingly holding a grudge for no apparent reason.<br /> <br />Kanzaki Minaka stood up on her own, brushing off the dust from her skirt.<br /> <br />“It’s rare to see a fool like you around. Is it going to rain swords tomorrow or something?”<br /> <br />“…I won’t bring down swords just because I came to the library.”<br /> <br />“Just kidding. Don’t take it seriously. This is why you’re a fool. So, what did you come here for?”<br /> <br />“I came to look for books on exorcising spirits.”<br /> <br />“Spirits?”<br /> <br />After throwing a sarcastic remark at him, Minaka, still confused, tilted her head when he explained that he was searching for a book to exorcise spirits.<br /> <br />She couldn’t fathom why he would be doing such a thing.<br /> <br />“…Jeez, I don’t get why you’d look for that kind of stuff here. It’s not like there’s a manga like Jujutsu XXX in the library.”<br /> <br />“That’s not it! I’m seriously looking for a book to exorcise spirits.”<br /> <br />“Hmph, it’s a library. Keep your voice down.”<br /> <br />“S-sorry.”<br /> <br />After careful consideration, Minaka realized that he was searching for a popular manga on exorcising spirits.<br /> <br />He pointed out that he was actually looking for a proper book, but his voice was too loud,<br /> <br />and he received a stern warning from her.<br /> <br />“So, why did you decide to look for a book on exorcising spirits?”<br /> <br />“Actually—”<br /> <br />In a calmer setting, Minaka prompted him to explain why he was searching for that book.<br /> <br />He opened up about feeling strange gazes recently, not being able to identify them even when he turned around, and suspecting that he might be possessed by a spirit. After hearing everything, Minaka’s reaction was one of disbelief.<br /> <br />She looked at him as if witnessing a genuine idiot.<br /> <br />“”You’re just being stalked by someone. It’s not a ghost or anything.”<br /> <br />“But, there is nowhere to hide, like on the train platform?”<br /> <br />“If it’s truly an empty space. If you stick right next to the vending machine, depending on the angle, you won’t be visible. And if someone was peering from the stairs, they wouldn’t be seen.”<br /> <br />“W-Well, you have a point. You’re a genius.”<br /> <br />“…Even if you call me a genius for this, I’m not happy at all.”<br /> <br />When Saito praised Minaka for pointing out that blind spot, she looked dissatisfied.<br /> <br />After realizing that, he noticed. By praising this, it’s like acknowledging her talent in stalking.<br /> <br />Certainly not something to be pleased about.<br /> <br />Saito regretted his choice of words.<br /> <br />“Well, having a suspicion means it’s probably stalking. Just to confirm, Saito, do you feel the gaze when you’re with Lily?”<br /> <br />Now that it was clear it wasn’t a spirit but stalking, MInaka wanted to confirm if Saito feels it when Lily is around.<br /> <br />“Come to think of it, I usually feel the gaze when Lily is with me.”<br /> <br />Indeed, Saito felt the gaze when Lily was with her.<br /> <br />However, when asked if he felt it when Lily was alone, he said he didn’t feel anything. So, it’s likely not directed at Lily.<br /> <br />“I see. In that case—!?”<br /> <br />“In that case?”<br /> <br />Minaka seemed to understand something when she heard that.<br /> <br />However, just as she was about to say something, she seemed to notice something midway and covered her mouth as if realizing something.<br /> <br />As Minaka made a face as if about to say something she shouldn’t, Saito prompted her to reveal what she had in mind.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s nothing. Well, if you’re having trouble with stalking, I recommend going to the police.”<br /> <br />However, Minaka didn’t easily go along with that suggestion and deftly avoided the topic.<br /> <br />“I see. Thanks for today. Kanzaki, I thought you were a sarcastic girl, but you’re surprisingly nice.”<br /> <br />Disappointed, but having gained a significant insight by coming to the library, Saito tried to lift his spirits.<br /> <br />Next time, he decided to be more aware of blind spots. Thanking Minaka, he turned away from her.<br /> <br />“Wait.”<br /> <br />“Hmm? What is it?”<br /> <br />At that moment, Minaka stopped Saito.<br /> <br />Wondering what was going on, Saito looked at Minaka’s face with curiosity. She seemed uneasy, then took a deep breath and spoke.<br /> <br />“Minazuki, you see. What do you think of Lily-chan?”<br /> <br />“What do you mean? She’s just a childhood friend.”<br /> <br />Asked about Lily,<br /> <br />Saito immediately shared his feelings.<br /> <br />“Right. But, what if, hypothetically, a knight in shining armor appeared in front of her and took her away? How would you feel?”<br /> <br />In response, Saito, trying to understand Minaka’s somewhat unclear intentions, asked a question.<br /> <br />“Um, just to confirm, if it’s taken away, does that mean you can’t talk to them anymore or can’t meet them?”<br /> <br />“It’s not about being taken away. It’s simply about getting a boyfriend.”<br /> <br />Her wording was peculiar, so Saito didn’t quite understand what she meant. Desperate to comprehend her intention, he proactively asked for clarification.<br /> <br />As a result, understanding what Minaka wanted to know, Saito nodded and said,<br /> <br />“It’s fine, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />“!?”<br /> <br />Nonchalantly stating that, Saito surprised Minaka.<br /> <br />It seemed quite unexpected to her.<br /> <br />From an outsider’s perspective, it might be natural to be suspicious when someone like Lily, who supposedly dislikes guys, is getting along well with a guy. However, for Saito, Lily was not that kind of person.<br /> <br />Literally, she was his childhood friend,<br /> <br />someone he had known since he was a kid.<br /> <br />Though there were moments when he thought of her as a slightly troublesome sister or older sister, he never thought of her in any other way.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s her decision. I have no right to say anything about it. Well, if the guy turns out to be a total jerk, maybe I’ll say something. But if she thinks he’s good, I want to respect her choice. She’s been through a lot, and if she can be happy, that’s what matters.”<br /> <br />Therefore, Saito wouldn’t be saddened by her getting a boyfriend.<br /> <br />Instead, he even wished her happiness, considering her struggles.<br /> <br />When he first met Lily, she was like a ghost who seemed to disappear at any moment.<br /> <br />It is a great pleasure for Saito to have her in his life.<br /> <br />“Ah, but, I don’t think a white knight suits Lily.”<br /> <br />However, during the conversation with Minaka, they seemed to have a slight difference in understanding, so Saito denied that a white knight would suit her with a wry smile.<br /> <br />” Eh? “<br /> <br />“Because, even though she may seem delicate at first glance, she’s incredibly strong. No matter what difficulties come her way, she’ll struggle to overcome them. She’s a strong heroine like that.”<br /> <br />Lily Machigane was not a weak heroine who would stop and seek help when faced with misfortune.<br /> <br />She was a strong heroine who could carve her own path and face difficulties head-on. Saito knew that.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />It was seven years ago.<br /> <br />Seven years ago, when Lily and Saito were still in the early years of elementary school, Lily was being bullied by her classmates.<br /> <br />The reason was slightly different from the first time, but generally the same.<br /> <br />It all started when she became the object of affection for popular boys in the class, which led to her being disliked by the girls in the class. She faced insidious bullying, such as having erasers and textbooks hidden, pencil leads broken, and even mud thrown at her on the way home.<br /> <br />Saito was her source of comfort, but honestly, it was tough.<br /> <br />Learning from the reflections of her first life, she tried to avoid making close friends and always made an effort to be alone.<br /> <br />So, she would never experience the pain of being betrayed by others.<br /> <br />However, everything else remained unchanged.<br /> <br />Enduring the daily pain of being targeted for no reason was agonizing, and the accumulated frustration was overwhelming.<br /> <br />Finally, one day during the summer vacation, after enduring all of it,<br /> <br />Lily encountered the girls from her class in a park on her way to the station to welcome Saito, who was coming to play.<br /> <br />“Why bother wearing fashionable clothes? They don’t suit you at all.”<br /> <br />“The smell of trash must have rubbed off on your clothes. How cute~”<br /> <br />They said, surrounding Lily and throwing dog feces from nearby on her white dress.<br /> <br />As a result, her dress became stained and started emitting the smell of feces, and her classmates laughed satisfiedly.<br /> <br />“… sniff …why, huff, why like this? sniff”<br /> <br />In the midst of having her long-awaited meeting with her only solace, her childhood friend, ruined, Lily shed large tears and attempted to voice her protest.<br /> <br />However, a flashback to past traumas triggered a feeling of nausea in Lily, causing her to struggle for words.<br /> <br />“Huff, huff”<br /> <br />“Oh, what’s wrong?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>“Oh, I get it. You’re so happy to become friends with poop that you’re crying, right? Huh, isn’t that right, Machiko-san?”<br /> <br />An obvious abnormal state.<br /> <br />Yet, the young girls remained oblivious to Lily’s distress and continued to taunt her.<br /> <br />(It’s painful, painful, painful, painful, painful, painful, painful, painful. Someone, please, help me.)<br /> <br />Lily silently pleaded for help within herself, enduring the insults, but no one came to her rescue. No convenient turn of events occurred.<br /> <br />She couldn’t tell how much time had passed.<br /> <br />Enduring the insults from the girls, she eventually realized they were gone. The park was left with Lily alone.<br /> <br />(For now… let’s go back. I can’t let Saito see me like this.)<br /> <br />Taking about five minutes to regain control of her breathing and restore rational thoughts, the first thing that came to Lily’s mind was that.<br /> <br />She didn’t want to show this pathetic side to her childhood friend.<br /> <br />“Lily! What’s with that appearance!?”<br /> <br />“W-well…”<br /> <br />However, those thoughts were in vain as Saito appeared in the park.<br /> <br />Despite her white dress being stained and dirty, Saito approached without a care, causing tears to flow from Lily’s eyes once again.<br /> <br />“No, don’t look! This is not right!”<br /> <br />Lily didn’t want him to be disappointed.<br /> <br />Solely for Saito, for him not to distance himself like the other male classmates,<br /> <br />Lily rejected and pleaded for him not to look.<br /> <br />“What’s different? I don’t get it. It doesn’t make sense. Anyway, let’s go to your house.”<br /> <br />“It’s not poop!”<br /> <br />“I know! What’s with that? Just be quiet and follow me.”<br /> <br />However, Saito didn’t stop approaching.<br /> <br />No matter how dirty Lily was, he touched her without hesitation and led her home.<br /> <br />By doing so, Saito discovered that Lily had been bullied.<br /> <br />“What the hell is that!? I’ll crush those pigs for you.”<br /> <br />“Stop! Saito. Please stop… I’m already satisfied with just having you.”<br /> <br />Saito, upon hearing the story, was furious.<br /> <br />He wanted to teach those bullies a lesson, but if he did that, even Lily, his childhood friend, would see him as a bad guy.<br /> <br />That’s not what Lily wanted.<br /> <br />Just having him genuinely angry for her sake, staying with her, was enough for Lily.<br /> <br />That understanding was all she needed.<br /> <br />“Is that enough for you!? Lily! Aren’t you angry!? Don’t you want revenge!? Aren’t you mad at all!? Are you really thinking that seriously!? Answer me!”<br /> <br />“I… I…”<br /> <br />However, Saito saw through that as a lie.<br /> <br />No, even though everyone understood, he crossed the line that no one had dared to step into.<br /> <br />As a result, Lily’s heart wavered.<br /> <br />It was impossible not to feel angry.<br /> <br />It was impossible not to want revenge.<br /> <br />However, what would change if she acted on those emotions?<br /> <br />The mature thoughts that came from experiencing a time leap whispered that it would be meaningless.<br /> <br />“Impossible… [Not true!] …!?”<br /> <br />Just as she tried to voice that it was impossible, those words were forcefully overwritten.<br /> <br />“You can do it! I know you can! So don’t give up!”<br /> <br />Saito, without any basis, said that Lily could do it and urged her not to give up.<br /> <br />“What-!? What does Saito understand about me!? To you, who only sees me once a month, what does Saito understand about me!? Don’t act like you know everything! Don’t speak like you know it all! Just go away!”<br /> <br />That touched a nerve in Lily.<br /> <br />His words felt like a denial of her entire first life.<br /> <br />It was unbearable.<br /> <br />So, that day, Lily forcibly drove Saito out of her house.<br /> <br />Since then, Lily struggled with self-loathing and became a recluse.<br /> <br />Even though Saito had said those things, she denied them.<br /> <br />She didn’t want to be separated from him, yet she pushed him away herself.<br /> <br />Above all, she despised herself for not feeling the desire for revenge and for lying that she didn’t want it.<br /> <br />She didn’t know how long she had been like this.<br /> <br />But when she realized it, the July calendar had turned to August.<br /> <br />Taking a deep breath, she opened the window. The air felt stagnant, perhaps because she had closed the curtains and left the air conditioner running.<br /> <br />To dispel it, she opened the window, and suddenly, her arm was grabbed.<br /> <br />“Finally showed your face, you shut-in. Today, I’m going to beat that rotten spirit out of you!”<br /> <br />“Lily!”<br /> <br />“Huh? Eeeeh!?”</p>







<p><br /> <br />In front of her was her childhood friend in a judo gi, and she was forcibly dragged outside. Her mother, Lucy, handed her a judo gi.<br /> <br />As her eyes widened in confusion, she found herself being taken away by her childhood friend, and before she knew it, they arrived at a deserted dojo.<br /> <br />“Yamada gramps, I brought her here!”<br /> <br />“Oh, Saito-kun, did you really bring a new disciple? Grandpa is thrilled!”<br /> <br />As Saito knocked on the door, an elderly man with a cane appeared.<br /> <br />“Ouch, there, old man, shave that beard properly every day.”<br /> <br />“Oh, sorry, sorry. I was busy with various things this morning.”<br /> <br />“Huh? What do you mean?”<br /> <br />Seeing the two enthusiastically hugging each other immediately after meeting, Lily couldn’t help but express her confusion about what was happening.<br /> <br />Her childhood friend proudly answered her.<br /> <br />“From today, you’ll also attend this dojo. For now, the goal is to become strong enough to beat those who bullied you. Do your best!”<br /> <br />“…I don’t understand anymore.”<br /> <br />Confused by the sudden turn of events, Lily mumbled softly and slumped down.<br /> <br />She then calmly inquired about how things had come to this point.<br /> <br />First, after being rejected by Lily, Saito apparently pondered on how to avoid being bullied that day.<br /> <br />And what the IQ 30 Saito came up with was that he needed to become strong to avoid bullying.<br /> <br />Certainly, in elementary school, merely learning judo or karate could make others hesitate to pick a fight.<br /> <br />Moreover, if one demonstrated a certain level of strength, it could intimidate others into thinking they couldn’t win.<br /> <br />So, Saito decided that Lily needed to learn Judo.<br /> <br />Lily thought it was stupid.<br /> <br />If this could really change things, bullying would have been long gone.<br /> <br />Because thinking it was meaningless, Lily tried to leave.<br /> <br />“I used my precious New Year’s gift money for this. You better do it! If you run away, I won’t forgive you.”<br /> <br />However, she couldn’t escape the threat of wasting the one-month tuition fee for this dojo, which came from the New Year’s gift money Saito had saved.<br /> <br />As a result, from that day on, Lily reluctantly started attending the judo dojo.<br /> <br />Initially practicing breakfalls for a few days, perhaps due to unexpectedly good adaptability and the fact that it was during the summer vacation, she was taught a single special technique.<br /> <br />The name was O-soto-gari.<br /> <br />A beginner-friendly move where you hook your leg around your opponent’s leg, bringing them down.<br /> <br />Having been taught this by a teacher in middle school PE in her previous life, it was easy to remember. With practice, she smoothly became able to execute the move. Three days before the end of summer vacation, she managed to score an ippon, albeit just once, against boy of her age.<br /> <br />“I wondered if there was really any point in doing this.”<br /> <br />Lily muttered to herself on the way home from the dojo.<br /> <br />She felt that she was getting stronger steadily.<br /> <br />However, she still harbored doubts about whether this strength would actually help solve real problems.<br /> <br />“It’s definitely meaningful. Trust me, it’ll work out.”<br /> <br />“Eh~? I wonder about that.”<br /> <br />Encouraging Lily, who wore an anxious expression, Saito tried to reassure her, but the unease remained.<br /> <br />“Oh, look, it’s Machigane-san. She’s on a date with a boy~. She’s so cheeky~.”<br /> <br />“Wow, really. That boy must also smell like crap for choosing such a shitty girl.”<br /> <br />At that moment, they encountered the two girls who had dirtied Lily’s clothes on the day she met Saito.<br /> <br />“Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.”<br /> <br />Grinning maliciously, the two girls verbally abused Lily and shook her body, causing her to tremble, her breathing becoming erratic.<br /> <br />Her vision wavered and distorted, and Lily inadvertently looked down.<br /> <br />“Look ahead. Is it really okay for you to be insulted like this? Is it okay not to do anything? What’s it going to be?”<br /> <br />Saito grabbed Lily’s head and forcibly lifted it, questioning her.<br /> <br />“Are you really okay with this??”<br /> <br />“How can you not feel anything after being told that? Are you just squatting there as usual?”<br /> <br />“I… I… hate it. I’m fine with being ridiculed. But I can’t stand those girls who mocked my childhood friend, who worked so hard for me!”<br /> <br />That day, Lily regretted lying.<br /> <br />The truth is, she hates it, and she wants to retaliate.<br /> <br />But back then, revenge seemed meaningless.<br /> <br />However, things are different now.<br /> <br />Not only was she hurt, but her precious childhood friend was also ridiculed.<br /> <br />That was something she absolutely couldn’t forgive.<br /> <br />On this day, for the first time in her life, Lily expressed her honest feelings of anger.<br /> <br />A girl who had never shown anger no matter how much she was hurt, now expressed intense rage because her cherished childhood friend was ridiculed.<br /> <br />“Good! Well said. You can do it. So, go ahead and give them a piece of your mind.”<br /> <br />Encouraged by Lily’s sincere emotions, Saito wore a satisfied expression and gave her a push.<br /> <br />“Yeah!”<br /> <br />With a lively response, Lily approached the girl who had mocked Saito.<br /> <br />“Hey, I don’t know what’s got you angry, but don’t get carried away. Trash like you──You were abused by us anyway!”<br /> <br />However, from the girl’s perspective, Lily was just a weak girl who couldn’t do anything.<br /> <br />Perhaps mocking her for being unable to do anything, the girl easily tripped by Lily.<br /> <br />“…What’s going on?”<br /> <br />“What are you doing!? Let go of Yumi.”<br /> <br />“No. I’ll let go if she apologizes.”<br /> <br />“Don’t be insolent! Trash like you──aah!?”<br /> <br />Unable to comprehend the situation, the girl’s friend ordered Lily to let go, but Lily resisted.<br /> <br />She had a strong determination to not let go until her childhood friend received an apology.<br /> <br />The other girl, who didn’t like this, tried to intervene but moved too slowly. Lily effortlessly executed the O-soto-gari, and both of them ended up rolling on the ground together.<br /> <br />Looking down at the two lying on the ground, Lily boldly declared,<br /> <br />“Apologize! Apologize for calling Saito smelly!”<br /> <br />She poured out all her pent-up emotions.<br /> <br />“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“I’m sorry~!”<br /> <br />Despite coming from girls barely in their teens, there was an intimidating aura. The bullies shed tears as they apologized.<br /> <br />“Fine. But don’t ever make fun of Saito again. Otherwise, I’ll throw you again.”<br /> <br />Satisfied with the apologies, Lily punctuated her statement and quickly returned to Saito.<br /> <br />“Did it! I did it, Saito! They apologized properly!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, good job.”<br /> <br />And then, Lily, with a joyful shout, embraced Saito, saying that she, too, could fight and change the world a little. Saito, looking pleased, playfully tousled her hair with excitement.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On that day, the girl named Lily Machigane changed.<br /> <br />No longer the tragic heroine always frightened and seeking help from others, she took a step towards becoming a strong heroine who would face any difficulty, despite her immaturity.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />(Feeling the gaze)<br /> <br />Lily had similar thoughts to Saito.<br /> <br />However, unlike Saito, she knew exactly who the gaze was from, and it was clear.<br /> <br />Glancing in that direction, she made eye contact with her ex-boyfriend.<br /> <br />He quickly averted his gaze, as if saying, “Didn’t see anything.”<br /> <br />Even though he was trying to act like nothing happened, it was evident that he was trying to hide. That was Nishizono Haruki.<br /> <br />Having been in a relationship for just two years, Lily could somewhat understand what Haruki was thinking.<br /> <br />Not as much as Saito,<br /> <br />but Haruki was also relatively straightforward.<br /> <br />(He’s probably trying to help me again, like the first time with Akashi.)<br /> <br />Haruki started glancing at Lily all of a sudden today, and she couldn’t help but figure things out.<br /> <br />That her ex-boyfriend also possesses memories from the past, just like her.<br /> <br />And for some reason, she couldn’t understand, he seems to be attempting to start over with her.<br /> <br />(He’s really stupid.)<br /> <br />Haruki, without any doubt, thinks he can recreate everything just like in the first life.<br /> <br />To Lily, it’s pitiful. Because if he just takes a moment to look around, it should be easy to see that Lily is different from the Lily of the past.<br /> <br />She now has close friends, including a childhood friend who didn’t exist in the first life.<br /> <br />She talks to Kai that she used to avoid,<br /> <br />and she has friends who didn’t exist before.<br /> <br />Just by glancing around, it should be noticeable.<br /> <br />But Haruki, without confronting that reality, continues to behave as if everything is the same as the first life.<br /> <br />He’s waiting for an event that shouldn’t happen.<br /> <br />What else can you say but pity for someone trying to repeat the same things from the first life like a broken machine?<br /> <br />Feeling a sense of absurdity, all the hatred, disgust, and anger towards being cheated on became meaningless.<br /> <br />I was also stupid to be caught up with such a person.<br /> <br />(If you regret it so much, you should’ve never dated him again.)<br /> <br />With a curse in her mind, she opened her favorite book to calm herself.<br /> <br />Pasa.<br /> <br />Then, a folded paper fell from the gap in the book.<br /> <br />“What’s this?”<br /> <br />Lily, who didn’t remember putting anything other than a bookmark between the pages, picked it up and opened it to check the contents.<br /> <br />[Waiting on the rooftop after school. From Makabe]<br /> <br />“Again.”<br /> <br />The letter called for a meeting on the rooftop.<br /> <br />Considering the sender’s name being the same as the person who confessed to her on the first day of high school, the reason for the meeting is likely another confession.<br /> <br />Lily sighed, feeling troubled by the situation.<br /> </p>







<p> <br />Time goes by and it is after school.<br /> <br />After seeing Saito off to the library, Lily headed to the rooftop mentioned in the letter.<br /> <br />Honestly, she didn’t want to go.<br /> <br />She thought about pretending she didn’t see it and going back.<br /> <br />Because since the day of the confession, Lily and Makabe, the boy in question, hadn’t exchanged a single word.<br /> <br />In other words, the situation was almost the same as when he confessed for the first time, and the outcome was obvious.<br /> <br />Was it really necessary to go and convey this?<br /> <br />But, thinking that if she didn’t, she would keep getting confessed to, Lily reluctantly decided to go.<br /> <br />Gachari.<br /> <br />Opening the door to the rooftop, this time the roles were reversed. Makabe was waiting for Lily.<br /> <br />“Thank you for coming today, Machigane san.”<br /> <br />“I really didn’t want to come, you know.”<br /> <br />“Haha, that’s harsh.”<br /> <br />Makabe, noticing Lily’s presence, welcomed her with a genuinely happy smile.<br /> <br />However, Lily, with a touch of sarcasm, made a disdainful remark, and Makabe scratched his head apologetically.<br /> <br />That sight strangely irritated her. “What’s the matter?” Lily, wanting to end this quickly, straightforwardly asked about the purpose.<br /> <br />“It’s the same as that day. Will you go out with me?” </p>



<p>“No, thank you.” </p>



<p>Immediate response. </p>



<p>Moreover, in the middle of his lines… </p>



<p>“Hehe, ahahaha.”<br /> <br />As expected, it seemed that Makabe’s business was a confession. The moment this became clear, despite Makabe still talking, Lily cut him off decisively.<br /> <br />When she conveyed that she had no intention of dating, Makabe’s face twisted in frustration, but then he broke into laughter as if something had snapped.<br /> <br />In response to Makabe’s sudden change in demeanor, Lily’s instincts rang alarm bells, and she took a step back.<br /> <br />“Hehe, yeah, I knew. This was bound to happen. Because Lily Machigane hates men. She can’t even talk to them, let alone get close. She can’t make others truly understand her. So, I observed Lily Machigane from a distance, thinking about how I could date you. And I observed Saito Minazuki, thinking about how I could be friends. But no matter how much I observed and thought, a direct approach was impossible for a mob like me. So, I had a revelation. I should use underhanded tactics. I should resort to threats! Hey, if you don’t want to die, date me! Lily Machigane.”<br /> <br />As soon as he said that, Makabe took out a box cutter from his pocket and attacked.<br /> <br />“Lily!?”<br /> <br />Just then, the door swung open, and Haruki, with a panicked expression, appeared.<br /> <br />“Who the hell are you? Don’t get in the way!”<br /> <br />“Lily, run! I’ll handle this.”<br /> <br />A sudden intruder appeared.<br /> <br />Haruki, standing protectively in front of Lily, must have seemed like an interference to Makabe.<br /> <br />The target shifted from Lily to Haruki, and Makabe, armed with a knife, approached.<br /> <br />Seeing that, Haruki urgently instructed Lily to run.<br /> <br />“Get lost.”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />However, Lily didn’t obey.<br /> <br />Instead, in defiance of the order, she slipped past Haruki and glared at Makabe.<br /> <br />“Dieeeee!”<br /> <br />At that moment, Makabe had already swung the knife towards Lily’s face, and a direct hit was inevitable.<br /> <br />Just when everyone thought that, Lily’s hand grabbed Makabe’s arm just in time, preventing the knife from hitting.<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />Both men were wide-eyed at the unexpected turn of events.<br /> <br />Leaving the two men in disbelief, Lily moved on to the next action.<br /> <br />She grabbed Makabe’s collar, pulled him close,<br /> <br />Then, when he was off balance, tripped him and twisted his arm, locking the joint.<br /> <br />“Ow, ow, Lily. What the hell is going on!?”<br /> <br />“Who knows? What could it be?”<br /> <br />“Ahdhdhd!”<br /> <br />Makabe, who had underestimated Lily just because she was a woman, was restrained by Lily. Not intending to answer his questions seriously, Lily twisted his arm to the limit and made him drop the box cutter.<br /> <br />“Haruki, pick that up.”<br /> <br />“Uh, okay.”<br /> <br />Unable to release Makabe due to the restraints, Lily instructed Haruki to retrieve the knife, and Haruki did so with a bewildered expression.<br /> <br />Then, with overflowing questions, Haruki asked:<br /> <br />“Are you really the Lily Machigane I know? The one from the past?”<br /> <br />Due to having memories of the past, Haruki knew Lily from her vulnerable times.<br /> <br />So, the current scene must have been unbelievably shocking for him.<br /> <br />In response, Lily laughed and answered:<br /> <br />“I am Lily Machigane. The same Lily Machigane you cheated on and abandoned. But, thanks to someone’s influence, I might be a bit different now.”<br /> <br />With that,<br /> <br />Haruki, at that moment, widened his eyes to the extreme and soon shed tears.<br /> </p>

<p> <br />A little time passed, a few minutes later.<br /> <br />“See?”<br /> <br />Hearing about the attack on Machigane san on the rooftop, Saito and Minaka hurried to the scene.<br /> <br />When the two arrived, they saw Lily holding down a man who seemed to be the attacker.<br /> <br />Saito proudly stated that it was as he said when he saw that.<br /> <br />“…No way.”<br /> <br />Seeing that, Minaka muttered under her breath, then stood still in astonishment.”</p>
