<p><h2>Chapter 3: The Night of the Meteor Shower</h2></p>

<p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>1</strong></p></p>

<p>Three years have passed. A lot happened.</p>

<p>For instance, Thor and I trapped my uncle on my mother&rsquo;s side into a pit and caused him to break his bones.</p>

<p>For instance, I punished the pirates who were selling slaves in the port city of Kartedt once again.</p>

<p>For instance, I cursed a duke&rsquo;s daughter who wanted Thor as her own knight with nightmares&#8230;</p>

<p>For some reason, I had nothing but a bad reputation spread about me, but as long as I was with Thor, I wasn&rsquo;t scared of anything, and we competed for good and bad things together.</p>

<p>Through this and that, I turned fourteen, and Thor turned fifteen.</p>

<p>I was still child-like, but Thor was tall enough to look like an adult, becoming more and more of a ladykiller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haa...that guy&rsquo;s so sly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Thor went out in town, young girls cried out to him shrilly.</p>

<p>He had completely mastered gentlemanly behavior and smiling politely.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Hey, Thor, please stop being so pointlessly amiable with all the girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped, milady. The O&rsquo;Drielle house is prone to bad rumors. You have to be as amiable as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Certainly, I&rsquo;m getting bashed with plenty of malicious gossip behind my back just today alone. Saying how it&rsquo;s disgusting that I&rsquo;m having you follow me around, looking like I owned you. Saying how pitiful you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, milady, am I pitiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Ask yourself that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Today, we came to the Kingdom of Ruschia&rsquo;s third-largest city, Delhague, for Father&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>This was the Bigreitz family&rsquo;s domain, a duchy, and Father was an advising magician to the Bigreitz family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow is the duke&rsquo;s ball. Thor, when we get home, we must hold dance lessons again. Dancing is the only thing you&rsquo;re bad at, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood. I don&rsquo;t want to embarrass myself either&#8230; But it&rsquo;s depressing...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, look, Thor. How cute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were all sorts of street booths lined up next to each other on the crowded main street, and I stopped at a shop that sold accessories made of natural stones. None of them were expensive, but the eastern design was so original and unique that I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at it a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there something you want? I can buy it for you, if you wish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s fine. I hadn&rsquo;t fallen so low as to have a servant buy something for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, milady, today is your fourteenth birthday. You were happily able to meet me, so it was the luckiest day of your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...You&rsquo;ve even become able to say that, huh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mmm, well, if you insist~, then the light hue of these red crystal teardrop-shaped earrings is quite pretty~.</p>

<p>I appraised the items, not as annoyed as I seemed, and then&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kyaaaaa! Purse snatchers! Somebody stop them~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard a high-pitched scream from the main street. There were scoundrels even in cities that were as greatly managed as this one.</p>

<p>Apparently, two men were on the run after stealing a middle-aged woman&rsquo;s bag, and there were no guards nearby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ordered, and Thor gripped the sword handle at his hip and flew out.</p>

<p>And then, using his specialty levitation magic, he made the bag the scoundrels stole float up into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah!&rdquo; &ldquo;The bag flew!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scoundrels hurriedly stopped, and right after they tried to reach for the bag floating in midair, Thor&rsquo;s sword danced cleanly and cut off their equipment and clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gyah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned towards the two scoundrels, who were embarrassed for some reason,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myr vis makia&mdash;&mdash;O thorns, bind them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I used simple&#12304;Grass&#12305;magic and utilized the rose shrubs right at the edge of the street, slowly extending the thorns to bind up their unseemly naked bodies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ow ow ow ow ow!&rdquo; &ldquo;The thorns are pricking me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scoundrels were writhing in pain, but if they did that, the thorns would cut into their skin even more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahaha, how pathetic! It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re trying to steal other people&rsquo;s belongings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, who the hell&rsquo;s this shitty brat~!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you can talk to me like that? I&rsquo;ll tie you up even tighter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady, please stop playing with the scoundrels now. I do not know which is the villain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor returned the bag to the woman and chided me. It was almost always like this.</p>

<p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>2</strong></p></p>

<p> &ldquo;To think that the daughter of the O&rsquo;Drielle house and that knight dealt with the purse snatchers, I&rsquo;m impressed! Speaking of which, you also crushed those pirates at Kartedt, correct? Goodness, really, how frightening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we were having a dance lesson in the villa, we were summoned by Lord Bigreitz, the duke of Delhague, who had learned of the incident. Though he was shocked, he gave thanks to me on the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be uneasy as well, Elliot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fufu. Thor looks after Makia, so I am not so worried about her, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father was in the room as well, and it seemed that he had just been making the arrangements for tomorrow with the duke.</p>

<p>The duke was twelve years older than Father and had many children. Incidentally, he had a daughter the same age as me, Miss Sumilda, and she was extremely spoiled and selfish.</p>

<p>As for the duke himself, well, he got along well with Father and not a bad person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a reward, I shall allow you the use of the star observation tower next to the castle. You have said you were interested in it before, correct?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, are you sure, Your Grace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unthinkingly, I clasped my hands together and leaned forward.</p>

<p>The Bigreitz house was on a hill that overlooked Delhague, and there was a star observation tower next to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you may. I&rsquo;m impressed with how studious you are, Miss Makia. I only wish my daughter would have that much enthusiasm&#8230; She is only obsessed with collecting the latest dresses&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll be on my way now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duke was in the middle of talking about his troubles, but I pulled Thor out of the room with me.</p>

<p>When we left the room, the aforementioned duke&rsquo;s daughter Sumilda was there, who toyed with her ringlets that looked like croissants stuck to both sides of her head as she said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Makia? I shall deign to play with you now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sorry, Sumilda. I&rsquo;m a bit busy with stargazing right now. Tomorrow then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was somewhat my childhood friend and an attention-seeker, so she tried to play with me.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t have so much time on my hands, so I had to decline for today.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that okay, milady? She is the daughter of the duke, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine. That girl tried to use her money and influence to steal you away before, Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh...that did happen, didn&rsquo;t it. You cursed Miss Sumilda with nightmares and made her give up, if I remember correctly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t forgive anyone who tries to steal you away from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p> &ldquo;Because I am milady&rsquo;s favorite, eh. It&rsquo;s tough to be popular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...You look too proud of that. It&rsquo;s making me angry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we were talking, I remembered that I wanted to ask Father something about tomorrow and came to a stop with an &ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I go and ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s about the present for Mother, so I&rsquo;ll ask him directly. Thor, you go on ahead and get ready. Even though it&rsquo;s summer, it gets cold at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then I quickly turned back to the duke&rsquo;s room I was just in.</p>

<p>Sumilda was still there, still playing with those croissants on her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Makia, why have you returned? As expected, you do want to play with me after all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I want to ask Father something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was about to knock on the door, I heard Father&rsquo;s voice and my hand stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth...I have been considering adopting Thor into the O&rsquo;Drielle family as a son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I blinked in surprise at the eavesdropped words and incidentally looked at Sumilda. And then, the two of us pressed our ears against the door.</p>

<p>Son-in-law? By son-in-law, was he talking about my husband?</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Oho. I&rsquo;ve heard that the boy possesses outstanding skill in both magic and swordsmanship. His looks are quite good as well. I don't know how many times my daughter has begged me for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hahaha. He&rsquo;s a very clever child as well as sensible, so I sometimes heedlessly take him to work with me. And Makia ends up complaining to me, saying that she was dying of boredom because I took Thor with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahahaha. That seems like something she would say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem like something you&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; Same as the duke, Sumilda, next to me, said that. How noisy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that just shows how capable and talented Thor is. Not many people have that much talent in magic and the sword. If my daughter Makia hadn&rsquo;t found him, he might still be a slave now. When I think about that, as expected, it must be fate that he came to our home&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father paused for a bit, and then presented the duke with a favor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If possible, I wish to send Thor to the knight academy in the capital at the same time Makia goes to magic school. However, there is no way to enroll into that school other than with a recommendation. If possible, I would like to have your assistance in this matter, Your Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. You will have it, Elliot. We&rsquo;ve known each other for a long time. And we the Bigreitz house also desire the flourishing of the O&rsquo;Drielle house, our advising magicians&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I finished listening to the conversation between the duke and Father and half-ran away from that spot, even forgetting that I wanted to ask Father something. All the while holding my head in my hands, panicking.</p>

<p>Thor is my son-in-law.</p>

<p>Thor is my son-in-law...he said...!?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to marry a man who used to be a slave, Makia? The O&rsquo;Drielle family sure has fallen far. I mean, I&rsquo;m a candidate for the crown prince&rsquo;s consort!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sumilda made snide comments, following me all the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with those remarks, Sumilda? I thought you wanted Thor so badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s going to be my knight, then I can ignore his birth. It&rsquo;s more important to have good looks. But it&rsquo;s a different story when it comes to marriage. It&rsquo;s impossible for a noblewoman to marry a man who used to be a slave. You should put a stop to this, Makia~. The O&rsquo;Drielle house is going to be looked down on more and more. Fufu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stopped in my tracks.</p>

<p>In the end, Sumilda also thought of Thor as a &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, and even though she wanted him, she didn&rsquo;t think of him as an equal or a good partner.</p>

<p>It was the same as those people who were trading him as a slave. She just wanted him because he was beautiful.</p>

<p>No one really loved Thor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get looked down on? That&rsquo;s just fine. I don&rsquo;t care what other people say. As long as I like Thor, they can&rsquo;t complain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll become a great witch, and the future baroness. If Thor supports me by my side as my husband, then I would surely be the strongest, and I&rsquo;ll create a big storm first. The first thing that&rsquo;s going to be blown away is your precious closet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sumilda turned pale and immediately ran off to check on her closet.</p>

<p>I also flew out of the Bigreitz mansion and ran into the star observation tower.</p>

<p>For some reason, I wanted to see Thor&rsquo;s face fiercely. My chest was squeezing tightly.</p>

<p>Maybe it was because I was running up the spiral staircase as fast as I could, but I couldn&rsquo;t breathe. I came to a stop midway to catch my breath and asked myself a question.</p>

<p>Did I just say I liked Thor?</p>

<p>Of course I liked him. Ever since I met Thor, he has always been important to me. But could this &ldquo;like&rdquo;...be a romantic love?</p>

<p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>3</strong></p></p>

<p> &ldquo;Is something the matter, milady? Even though the stars are so beautiful, you&rsquo;ve been clenching your teeth and glaring at me for a while now. It&rsquo;s scary. ...Did I do something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Oh, no. Nothing at all, nhm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have picked up something strange to eat, milady. It&rsquo;s something you would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true that I was on the highest floor of the star observation tower I was finally allowed access to, sitting on the bench and only staring at Thor&rsquo;s face when I could be looking at the clear night sky.</p>

<p>Father said he&rsquo;s trying to make you into his adopted son-in-law...Should I tell him?</p>

<p>But, if I said that, Thor would definitely refuse it. No doubt he would snort and say something like &ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather die than marry you, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mean, well, I was aware that I had done a lot of things that had people saying that. I had declared something like that to Sumilda, but it couldn&rsquo;t happen if Thor refused in the first place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady, here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor sat next to me and spread out his cloak. At a time like this&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m...not really that cold. I&rsquo;m actually feeling rather hot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling just a bit cold, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true that it was my special seat. I excitedly slipped inside the cloak and tucked myself in. I was small, so I fit in snugly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought, you&rsquo;re warm, milady. As expected of one blessed by&#12304;Fire&#12305;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only you would turn the lady you&rsquo;re serving into your hot-water bottle, Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though this was a usual thing.</p>

<p>Today, I felt like I&rsquo;d even be able to consciously hear Thor&rsquo;s heartbeat. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve been able to be normal until now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, honey milk coffee. It&rsquo;s warm, but would you prefer it cold?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, warm is better. ...Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I received the mug and took tiny sips. And then, a long sigh and a slight silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are acting strange, milady. I can&rsquo;t believe you didn&rsquo;t notice I didn&rsquo;t add any honey&#8230; Usually you would complain it wasn&rsquo;t sweet enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only now did I realize it. It was true that I usually liked to drink milk coffee with a lot of honey, and Thor was well aware of that and mixed in the amount I liked for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;E-Even I drink unsweetened coffee once in a while!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a composed face, I took another sip, but now that I was aware that it was unsweetened, I made a frown.</p>

<p>Thor snatched away my mug in a flash and mixed in a spoonful of honey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Mm. Yes, this is much tastier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is. Milady, you should be more honest like that. You may seem twisted and bitter, but you are actually very straightforward and honest, and that&rsquo;s your charm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re praising me or being sarcastic. Are you scheming something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t doubt me like that. I&rsquo;ve also been trained by you, and I&rsquo;ve gone from being twisted to being honest like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;re playing innocent&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, it was true that when we first met, Thor was like an abandoned, bone-thin dog who couldn&rsquo;t trust people.</p>

<p>He was still cheeky and sarcastic, but he had grown into a splendid knight of the O&rsquo;Drielle house.</p>

<p>I would one day become the baroness of the O&rsquo;Drielle family. For the sake of my family, it was certain that I must welcome a groom with magical power.</p>

<p>Would another man be standing next to me at that time?</p>

<p>No, I still couldn&rsquo;t imagine it. There weren&rsquo;t many people with more magical power than Thor, and if he was next to me, that would be the most reliable, and happiest, outcome.</p>

<p>I wondered what Thor thought about me&#8230;</p>

<p>I was staring up absentmindedly at the starry sky I could see from here, when a flash of light suddenly crossed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a shooting star!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;There had been occasional shooting stars since earlier. They&rsquo;re fascinating even without looking at them through a telescope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Thor, we have to make a wish on the shooting star.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put the mug aside and stood up, then put my hands on the tower&rsquo;s handrail and looked up at the star-filled sky.</p>

<p>The stars twinkled intensely. Like pounding hearts.</p>

<p> &ldquo;Oh, another shooting star!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish milady will pass the exams for magic school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was open-mouthed at what Thor wished for behind me for a moment, but then began to worry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that your wish, Thor? You can&rsquo;t, you have to wish for yourself more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for me. If you become a splendid witch, milady, the O&rsquo;Drielle family&rsquo;s future will be secure. That is to say, the security of my life as well. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that might be so, but...But what if I couldn&rsquo;t pass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible, but it is what it is. It&rsquo;s not so bad to have more time to spend with you. The year after next, milady, you will be living in a dorm when you attend magic school, so I won&rsquo;t be able to see you properly for four years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are acting strange today, milady. Being docile or meek isn&rsquo;t like you. Perhaps you have a fever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor came to my side, inclined his head and met my gaze.</p>

<p>Somewhat worriedly, he put his hand to my forehead and cheek to gauge my temperature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re always hot, so I&rsquo;m not sure&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said, making dumb jokes as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Thor...will you stay by my side forever?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor widened his eyes slightly at me, who was looking down and acting meek once again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. I am the one you found. My wish is to serve by your side as your knight when you become the baroness of the O&rsquo;Drielle house. ...Even when you accept the second son of some nobleman as your groom one day, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somehow, his last sentence felt awfully sad.</p>

<p>I must have made a strange face, because Thor said, &ldquo;Oh, could it be because of this? Were you introduced by the duke and approached with a marriage offer when you returned to the master earlier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it. I thought...it was about time for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since I couldn&rsquo;t say anything, Thor forced a smile, misunderstanding the situation, and touched my ear for some reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t move, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a serious face, Thor affixed something to my ear while brushing away the hair at the side of my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...This is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the red crystal earrings you were looking at in that stall on the main street this morning. They are quite cheap, though... Happy fourteenth birthday, milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After showing me the other one, he attached it to my ear, still looking serious.</p>

<p>And then, Thor knelt down, like a faithful knight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pledge my loyalty to you for life, Miss Makia O&rsquo;Drielle. For me as well, today is a day of destiny when I first met you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even though the night wind caressing my cheeks was so cold.</p>

<p>Thor&rsquo;s passionate and sincere words, in his own style, moved my heart, and made me feel impatient at the same time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why, I&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Thor. Can&rsquo;t you be my groom instead of the second son of some noble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;Father is thinking about adopting you into the O&rsquo;Drielle family as his son-in-law after sending you to the knight academy. To put in simply, you are my bridegroom. If you&rsquo;re willing, I&#12540;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wa...wait a minute, wait, milady. What in the world are you saying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor seemed to be truly astonished by my bombshell statement, as he stood up and hurriedly shook his head.</p>

<p>But he was much more red-faced and flustered than I expected.</p>

<p>I thought he would laugh at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That kind of thing cannot be! I&rsquo;m a nobody who was born in the slums of a foreign country who was without a doubt born to truly cruel, cruel parents. I would degrade the dignity of the O&rsquo;Drielle house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe you more than I could ever repay in my life for finding and raising me, and now you&rsquo;re going to adopt me as a son-in-law. You don&rsquo;t need to do all that for me, it&rsquo;s already enough, I&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Thor. We just treasure you and want you to become a true member of our family. Because, I&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Milady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor put his index finger to my lips and shook his head again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady, you still don&rsquo;t know this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have many different encounters in the future. At magic school and in society. Didn&rsquo;t you say you wanted to work at the royal palace? I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll experience a wider world there. You might even find a man you like. Settling on a marriage partner before you even know true love is just too confining and stifling. It restricts your freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But...I can say the same for you, Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might also come to like another girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I later pondered on the meaning of the words that came overflowing out of me.</p>

<p>It meant that Thor would love another girl and won&rsquo;t look at me anymore&#8230;</p>

<p>And then for some reason I felt incredibly sad. I had no idea why I felt so sad, but my eyes turned hot and I felt like crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, I&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing me like that, Thor was about to make some sort of appeal.</p>

<p>But, it happened at that moment.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard it before, but I felt like I knew it somehow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The sound of good tidings resounded loudly throughout the whole area. And just when my surroundings suddenly brightened, meteors--the number incomparable to what I&rsquo;ve seen until now--raced across the night sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha...a meteor shower!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this world, meteors were good tidings.</p>

<p>They announced the arrival of something exalted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a sharp headache, I felt a strange sensation, as though a dizzying swarm of light was swallowing me up.</p>

<p>Then for some reason, many, many unfamiliar visions flashed through my head.</p>

<p>The scenery of a distant world that wasn&rsquo;t here.</p>

<p>The boy who comforted me when I was crying from failing my exams.</p>

<p>Another girl, who liked the same person I did even though we were supposed to be close friends.</p>

<p>Dusk, when I ran to the rooftop to convey something.</p>

<p>And then, what I saw.</p>

<p>A bright red twilight, a sea of blood, and two people on the ground.</p>

<p>The blond man, who killed me.</p>

<p>Ah. This was my usual dream of that spineless and dull girl.</p>

<p>A dream? No, that wasn&rsquo;t it.</p>

<p>This was my life from before my current one--my &ldquo;past life&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I understood that. But I had been told by the meteors that my dream was something that leaked out from my memories of my past life.</p>

<p> &mdash;&mdash;Your name shall be Thor.</p>

<p> Suddenly, the memory of me naming Thor in this world was triggered within me.</p>

<p>That name, which I spontaneously gave him, which came down into my head like a divine revelation.</p>

<p>Thor. Tooru. Tooru&#8230;*</p>

<p> (TN: Thor and Tooru are written the same way in Japanese.)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, the name of the one I liked in my past life was &ldquo;Saitou Tooru.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Have I possibly given him the name of my crush from my past life?</p>

<p>No. He and I died at the same time, in the same place.</p>

<p>Could it be that you are that boy&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My consciousness was finally brought back to the present.</p>

<p>The lights that had raced before my eyes had all passed by before I knew it, and with the end of the meteor shower, the quiet night returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Ow&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, next to me Thor was pressing his hand against his chest and complaining about a sudden pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Thor!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I suddenly...felt a burning pain in my chest&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor staggered and leaned against the railing, and then slowly crouched down to the ground.</p>

<p>There was a light shining from his chest.</p>

<p>I had already thrown away my confusion towards the things I remembered earlier, took off the coat of Thor right in front of me and unbuttoned his shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was stunned. Right above his heart, a strange mark with a faint light had appeared. The mark looked like a flower with four petals, or a star shining in four directions, or four swords protecting something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor, let&rsquo;s go to Father&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether it be the meteor shower or the memories of my past life that I remembered, there was something strange going on.</p>

<p>I felt magical power from the mark. It might be a curse.</p>

<p>I took a somewhat breathless Thor down the tower and went to Father.</p>

<p>However, the Bigreitz residence was also in an extraordinary panic, and everyone was shouting that it was an emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stars fell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Savior is arriving!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard talk like that here and there. Savior? What was&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You returned, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father came out of the back room with the duke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was astonished when I saw the stars. The sheer number of them in that meteor shower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&rdquo;That's not important right now, there&rsquo;s something wrong with Thor! A, a strange mark appeared above his heart&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wh-what if it&rsquo;s a curse? Thor looks like his chest hurts, like he&rsquo;s in pain&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at Thor sweating uncomfortably and his drawn face, Father had a grim expression on his face.</p>

<p>He checked that mark on his bared chest, and his eyes widened even more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. So he is one of the &lsquo;Guardians.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the duke who continued his sentence with a calm tone. Father nodded as well.</p>

<p>And then, they separated me from Thor and ordered their close aides to take him to the infirmary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor, Thor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milady&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thor turned his gaze in my direction and his face twisted in pain again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, please calm down. Thor might be in pain right now, but it will pass soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Father, you can undo Thor&rsquo;s curse, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not a curse, Makia. Thor was one of the &lsquo;chosen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Chosen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure...you and I both knew from when we first met him. That this child is special. But, this sort of thing&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Father cast his eyes down a little and smiled bleakly.</p>

<p>No, I didn&rsquo;t understand it at all. The meteor shower, what happened to Thor&rsquo;s body, or anything.</p>

<p>Father and the duke went into the back room again, and I was told to wait in my room.</p>

<p>Even though I was out of my mind with worry about what had happened to Thor.</p>

<p><p style="text-align:center"><strong>4</strong></p></p>

<p>The next day, Father told me this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia, calm down and listen to me. Thor has been summoned to the capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a situation I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That child was chosen. As one of the four Guardians who will protect the &lsquo;Savior&rsquo; from another world. The Bigreitz family has adopted Thor and they have kindly sent him to the capital with their support. This is the best for Thor. From now on, he will become an existence that is exceedingly distant from us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait...Please wait a minute. I don&rsquo;t...understand what you&rsquo;re saying, Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head many, many times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Thor? I&rsquo;ve been wanting to see him since yesterday. And, there&rsquo;s something I want to tell him&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia&#8230; Yes, let me put this bluntly. You must give up on Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That child is no longer your knight, and he is no longer a pupil of the O&rsquo;Drielle house or a servant. By being chosen by the stars, he has acquired a position higher than us. From now on, we can&rsquo;t have a part in his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t answer back with anything. I had no way to.</p>

<p>Did that mean, in short, that I would be separated from Thor?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were the one who found Thor. You gave him his name as well. As I thought, you are a witch who can bestow a fated name. Just like our ancestor, the &lsquo;Scarlet Witch.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...Name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. I was the one who gave Thor his name.</p>

<p>I unconsciously gave him the same name as the person I liked in my past life&#8230;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Makia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While pressing my hand against my throbbing chest, I ran out.</p>

<p>I flew out of the Bigreitz mansion and right then, I saw the carriage leaving from the mansion&rsquo;s gate.</p>

<p>Thor was riding in the carriage. His profile was somewhat dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait, Thor! Thor!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without being able to convey my feelings to the one I liked in my past life, I died with many regrets.</p>

<p>In that case, I had to make sure. Who exactly are you?</p>

<p>Because I still didn&rsquo;t know a thing about the true nature of these feelings that were supposed to be dimly lit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, the carriage didn&rsquo;t stop. I tried to use magic to chase after him, but I was stopped by Father behind me, and just like that, Thor was gone. To far, far away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why. Why&#8230;, Father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thor has a role he must play. I&rsquo;ll explain it all to you, so just bear with me for now, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;...No&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t accept it at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No no no! I&rsquo;m getting Thor back. No matter what it takes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was different from the past life me. I wouldn&rsquo;t let go of what was important to me, and if there was someone who would steal it away, I would stop them with all my power. I was the descendant of that kind of witch.</p>

<p>However, Father embraced me tightly, wrapping me who was on the verge of going on a rampage up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please give up, Makia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was severe, but it was probably also difficult for Father. Letting go of Thor.</p>

<p>It was because he loved him so much that he decided to give him up for adoption to the Bigreitz family.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Afterward, Father taught me about the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; of the night where stars fell in detail.</p>

<p>It was the legend of the Savior, handed down since ancient times in the Kingdom of Ruschia.</p>

<p>On the night where stars fall, the sound of good tidings shall inform the arrival of the Savior from another world.</p>

<p>At the same time, four stars shall scatter and select the four Guardians who shall become the Savior&rsquo;s shield.</p>

<p>The Crests of the Four Lights shall gather under the golden sword and pledge their loyalty.</p>

<p> The Savior shall head to the Holy Land, Vabel, and guide the chaos-embroiled Maydare to stability.</p>

<p> It was just like a story I heard somewhere.</p>

<p>This legend was intentionally replaced by another story, and the details were concealed. However, in actuality, it seemed that several Saviors had landed in Maydare up to now.</p>

<p>In this world, there was a fairytale called &ldquo;The Hero of Fraxinus&rdquo; that everyone knew.</p>

<p>It was the story of a brave young man who gathered four companions and defeated the three evil magicians. This was an example of a Savior legend that was based on a true story and left behind, and that brave young man was indeed the &ldquo;Savior of Fraxinus&rdquo; who descended from another world.</p>

<p>Thor was chosen to be in the same position as the &ldquo;four companions&rdquo; who appear in this fairytale.</p>

<p>Officially, he was the &ldquo;Guardian&rdquo; with a mark over his heart who helped the Savior.</p>

<p>Apparently, he was chosen by the guidance of the meteors on the night the stars fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must give up on Thor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I finally understood what Father said.</p>

<p>To put it simply, Thor was no longer my knight. He wasn&rsquo;t an existence to protect me.</p>

<p>Even though he said he would be by my side forever, the world didn&rsquo;t allow that.</p>

<p>Thor was already destined to pledge his absolute loyalty to the Savior from another world, and to protect them with his own body.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After a short time, I overheard Father telling Mother that the Savior was found by the Ruschia royal palace and taken under their protection. Apparently, she was a girl around the same age as me.</p>

<p>Thor had become a knight who would protect a &ldquo;girl&rdquo; from another world&mdash;someone who wasn&rsquo;t me.</p>
