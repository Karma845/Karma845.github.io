<h2>Chapter 3: The Golden Cube</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Golden Cube?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, I steeled my resolve and headed towards the Dungeon Association. At the Association, there was an emergency recruitment poster hanging. I read the words &ldquo;First Period Exploration Team Recruitment for the suddenly appeared Golden Cube&rdquo; and &ldquo; No specific rank necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No specific rank necessary huh... Can I, a Rank 0, participate? And the reward for participation is&#8230; 1 million yen!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After reading the specifics written at the bottom of the paper, my eyes became like pinpoints. I then went and asked the receptionist what it was all about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s correct. We will pay you 1 million yen just for participating,&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!? Are you kidding me? Why would you do that!?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be frank, we have no idea what&rsquo;s inside the cube. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re currently assembling the first exploration team, but not many people have volunteered to join. Since we have no idea what&rsquo;s inside, we don&rsquo;t even know what level of adventurers we should be recruiting. That&rsquo;s why many people are hesitant&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see&#8230; So, can I participate even though I&rsquo;m an unranked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s not a problem. Even if you find combat difficult, you can help carry items or support other participants. However, please be aware that it could be a long expedition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the monthly quota&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for this special cube, from the moment you participate, we will treat it the as a dungeon clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll participate!! Kai Amachi! I&rsquo;ll join the Golden Cube!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied immediately.</p>

<p>As a lone adventurer, it was impossible for me to conquer E-rank dungeons, and I had no future but to become food for the dungeon.</p>

<p>Therefore, even though it might be dangerous, the proposal to treat participation as a dungeon clear just for completing miscellaneous tasks paired with a reward offering of 1 million yen was very appealing to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood. I will register you. Please present your clearer&rsquo;s license.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you go,&rdquo;</p>

<p>From my wallet I display a license similar to a driver&rsquo;s license.</p>

<p>In the rank section of the card, &ldquo;unranked&rdquo; is written; this is my clearer&rsquo;s license it contains my information as a clearer.</p>

<p>The card also shows the last date I conquered a dungeon, which was three weeks ago when I was kicked out of a party by Sato.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confirmed. Kai Amachi. The event will start this Saturday, August 6th, from 1:00. On the topic of participation fees, we will pay you upon your return from the dungeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I receive a piece of paper with the details of the dungeon exploration.</p>

<p>Even though it occurred just yesterday. They sure do their jobs fast.</p>

<p>Well, I say that but for an unknown dungeon it&rsquo;s impossible to know when it might collapse so even a day can&rsquo;t be wasted.</p>

<p>That day, after finishing the registration, I left the Dungeon Association.</p>

<p>I returned to my rundown apartment and began to do maintenance on my equipment.</p>

<p>My only equipment, a cheap iron sword with a magic enchantment imbued on it which only reaches my waist.</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s a cheap sword with some nicks on the blade, it&rsquo;s still worth over a hundred thousand yen.</p>

<p>By becoming an adventurer, I received from the government just a single magic power imbued sword.</p>

<p>With this equipment, I can become somewhat stronger and with that, gain the ability to at least swing a sword around to some extent.</p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I immediately became a clearer and have been using the same thing for four months since then.</p>

<p>In a small six-tatami mat room, I continue to polish the long sword.</p>

<p>Alone, without turning on the lights, illuminated only by moonlight.</p>

<p>Although it is a very small house, recently it has somehow become very spacious.</p>

<p>Also, quiet and a little lonely</p>

<p> &#8230;</p>

<p> Saturday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I look at the pictures of my still lively mother and sister on my smartphone.</p>

<p>After a quick nod, I equip my long sword on my waist before heading to the meeting place, Shibuya Crossing.</p>

<p>There, 50 clearers had gathered.</p>

<p>The intersection was blocked off and there were not many people around, probably due to the fear of dungeon collapse.</p>

<p>I wrote my name and confirmed my participation at the reception of the makeshift tent that had been set up temporarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow, this this many people... this is a first. Is that... a foreigner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seems that there are also high-ranking clearers based on their equipment.</p>

<p>Moreover, aren&rsquo;t they US military personnel? A group of about ten people wearing foreign military uniforms are participating.</p>

<p>They all look very strong, they&rsquo;re probably high-ranking awakeners.</p>

<p>And then&#8230;</p>

<p>&quot;Gyahahaha, we're getting 1 million each with this!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can leave the fighting to the pros, okay!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right! You just need to watch from behind!&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed that Sato and others were also participating.</p>

<p>I hid behind the crowd, avoiding eye contact.</p>

<p>But Sato quickly found me.</p>

<p>&quot;Gyahahaha! Are you participating too? Poor people really don't want to lose out on 1</p>

<p>million, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey! Are you trying to ignore me? I'll kill you!&quot;</p>

<p>As I averted my gaze and sullenly stayed silent, Sato grabbed me by the neck.</p>

<p>I felt like I was about to be punched, but since there were many other clearers around,</p>

<p>Sato didn't go that far.</p>

<p>Some people noticed his voice and stared at us.</p>

<p>&quot;Tch! Shithead.&quot;</p>

<p>Sato pushed me away and left. I wasn't part of their party anymore, so I didn't need to grovel anymore.</p>

<p>Even so, resisting against Sato made my legs tremble a little, but I didn't feel bad about it.</p>

<p>At that same time, a man walked up to the golden cube.</p>

<p>&quot;Attention!!&quot;</p>

<p>He gathered the attention of the liberators* in the area with his loud voice. He appeared to be around thirty years old, and I felt like I had seen him somewhere before...</p>

<p>But to put it rudely, he had an air of being a typical &ldquo;can-do-it&rdquo; salaryman that you could find anywhere.</p>

<p>Rather, he could be called an elite salaryman.</p>

<p>Ike-uncle?*A working man that had a put together feeling.</p>

<p>Since he was wearing a robe, he was probably a magician. And since it was red, he was likely a fire-type magician.</p>

<p>&quot;I am Issei Tanaka! The Vice Guild Master of the Guild 'Avalon'!&quot;</p>

<p>With that single word, everyone begins to murmur.</p>

<p>Even I know about the top Japanese clearer group, Guild &quot;Avalon.&quot; Placing high on the world stage, it is the largest and strongest guild in Japan, with multiple S-Class awakened, of which there are only a few of in Japan, being members.</p>

<p>&quot;I thank you for volunteering for today's mission, which may be a matter of life and death in an unknown dungeon. Our guild has been entrusted with the investigation and strategy of this golden cube by the Japanese government and the Japanese</p>

<p>Dungeon Association. As a result, I have been appointed as the leader of this strategy. Please rely on me. Now, I will briefly explain the precautions and strategy!&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that Mr. Tanaka will lead this strategy. He has a proven track record and is also said to be an A-class strategist himself, so no one had any complaints.</p>

<p>Thus, he began to explain the precautions and strategy briefly.</p>

<p>However, since we don't know what's inside, the explanation was mainly about the chain of command and such.</p>

<p>The reason why the term &quot;chain of command&quot; was used was because there were US military personnel present.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Tanaka is technically the leader today, the US military team is apparently a completely separate unit.</p>

<p>It feels like military intervention, but that's a political matter so I don't really understand it.</p>

<p>As I was thinking about that, it seemed like the explanation had come to and end.</p>

<p>Mr. Tanaka looked at his watch and gave orders in an even louder voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, it's now 1:15 pm. Is everyone ready?&quot;</p>

<p>At that voice, many clearers responded by raising up their weapons. With Tanaka-san at the forefront, everyone lined up around the Cube.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. Let's go!&quot;</p>

<p>Tanaka-san kicked off and took a step towards the Cube.</p>

<p>His robe fluttered.</p>

<p>And the well-known top clearers who surrounded the Cube disappeared into it one by one..</p>

<p>&quot;All right! Let's do this!!&quot;</p>

<p>Sato and others followed, and the mid-level clearers disappeared into the golden cube.</p>

<p>And then.</p>

<p>&quot;All right...let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>I tightly grip my sword and slowly step forward.</p>

<p>I can hear my heart beating faster, to the point as if I can hear the sound of my own heartbeat.</p>

<p>In front of me is a box that looks like pure gold.</p>

<p>A golden wall that shimmers like a sparkling water surface.</p>

<p>I hesitate to touch it with my finger.</p>

<p>A gentle ripple like a fallen drop of water and a sound like a resolute wind chime echoes throughout.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew...okay!&quot;</p>

<p>And then, I tightly clenched both fists and single mindedly plunged in. With expectations and anxieties in my heart. Without knowing what lies ahead.</p>

<p>Into the golden cube.</p>

<p>...</p>

<h2>Translator notes:</h2>

<p>Liberators: In the raws &#65288;&#35299;&#25918;&#32773;&#65289;is used. It refers regularly to the clearers in this scene but since this title has not been used before, I was not sure if it was an error on the authors part but it translates to liberator so I used that.</p>

<p>Ike-Uncle: The word Ikemen&#65288;&#12452;&#12465;&#12513;&#12531;&#65289;is commonly used to describe good looking, younger boys. In the raw, ikeoji&#65288;&#12452;&#12465;&#12362;&#12376;&#65289;is used. Oji is a word that means uncle but is also used to describe older men (around 30's-50's) in general. So &#65288;&#12452;&#12465;&#12362;&#12376;&#65289;is a play on words to mean that Issei is cool, good-looking older man.</p>
