<h1 class="calibre1">Interlude: I Find Myself Conscious Of It</h1>

<p class="calibre4">Returning to the apartment from the drugstore, I warmed up and ate the dinner I had left at his place yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a late dinner, we set up some countermeasures again in my room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, I’ve taken measures at all the suspicious places. For the ones that involve burning something, it’s dangerous, so be sure to stay outside while it’s burning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This will save humanity. Thank you, Yuunagi-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s an exaggeration.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a great feat to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, good night. See you on Monday.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I honestly feel relieved when he leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Having a man in my room was a first in my life, so I didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Plus, I think I was more useless than usual because of the G.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, not ‘I think’, it definitely didn’t go as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No good, the more I try to think about it clearly, the more I find myself depending on him.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I already asked him to cook on weekdays, and today I even left the G countermeasures and light bulb changing to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He’s covering for the parts I’m missing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This is bad. It’s almost like dependence.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now, my life can’t go on without his support.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lately, I’ve been feeling different kinds of excitement too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even after the awkward atmosphere due to Yuunagi-kun making a morning call to Kuhouin-san, he rushed to help me in my pinch.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt my heart race for the first time when I touched someone of the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was much sturdier than I imagined, completely different from a woman’s body, making me conscious of it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, until this point, I could have excused it as an emergency situation where I wasn’t calm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But what really did me in was what he said on the way to the drugstore.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『…The woman I interact with the most is Tenjō-sensei, you know?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What does that even mean! Don’t play around with adults too much!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I take my frustration out on my body pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I completely self-destructed by acting pretentious.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You don’t understand my worries! Seriously!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even in his room, I try to act cool to not show my nervousness, but before I know it, I end up revealing my true self.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At school too, he sits so close to me that if I’m not careful, I feel like I can’t maintain my teacher mode.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Today, I couldn’t properly focus on my work, being so conscious of him staring at me!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi Nishiki’s presence shakes me more than I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Worst of all, there’s a part of me that’s happy to be spoken to like that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m at a loss about how to handle these unfamiliar feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Following the advice about contact frequency that my best friend gave me, the answer seems clear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">──Could this be the beginning of a forbidden love!?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“（Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!）”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I let out a voiceless cry while hugging my pillow.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What, that’s impossible. In so many ways.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, Reiyu Tenjō! He’s younger than you and a minor. He’s someone you shouldn’t fall in love with!</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how much I try to put the brakes on in my head, the intensity in my chest doesn’t subside.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Feeling suffocated, I lift my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mustn’t admit it. I have a feeling that if I do, a complete collapse will ensue.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I naturally try to suppress my smiling lips with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I let go of my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, my feelings are restless, and my expression softens.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The first time we walked together at night, it felt fresh and simply fun.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, what am I thinking, enjoying this!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Every time, after parting with him, I hold a solo reflection session, but the situation never improves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s only getting worse.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I thought I could manage everything if we had the Neighbor Agreement, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Living next to each other in the same apartment, it’s almost like a semi-cohabitation life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought it wouldn’t make a difference just to share meals with a boy around my brother’s age.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was completely naive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, even if I had thought it through, different parts of me would still react sensitively.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just incorporating a stranger into my daily life makes various controls slip away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It should be frightening, yet unknowingly, I find myself leaning forward more and more.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What is this relationship really about…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I lie down on my side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Man and woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Student and teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Younger and older.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Neighbors.</p>

<p class="calibre4">No matter how I phrase it, it doesn’t quite fit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Too formal to be friends, too intimate to be siblings, too much of a stretch to call it family.</p>

<p class="calibre4">A strange and peculiar comfort in this ambiguous distance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I feel as if I am constantly oscillating between tension and relaxation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can I still be your lover, even though I’m your teacher?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A wistful soliloquy, not meant for anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even as I speak, the conclusion is clear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s okay the way it is now. It’s enough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As long as I’m playing in the shallow water, I’m sure there’s no risk of drowning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I try to go deeper, this comfortable relationship will disappear like bubbles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s because it’s ambiguous that I can immerse myself in it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad tomorrow is a day off…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If it’s a holiday, I won’t have to see him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I should feel relieved, yet I also feel unsatisfied.</p>
