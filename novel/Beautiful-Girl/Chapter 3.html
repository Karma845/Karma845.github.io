<h2>Chapter 3: Height Difference</h2>



<p>Sometimes, people are creatures that grow,<br /> <br />especially during the transition from childhood to adulthood. The growth can be rapid,<br /> <br />with a few centimeters added seemingly overnight.<br /> <br />Yet, strangely, the person undergoing the growth or those constantly around them might not notice it.<br /> <br />It’s because an image has already formed within their minds,<br /> <br />making it challenging to become aware of any deviation unless prompted by some external factor.<br /> <br />Well, in the end, it’s just one of those things.<br /> </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />It was mid-April, and the cherry blossoms were at their peak.<br /> <br />Saito, having just left the infirmary, was examining the record sheet handed to him by his homeroom teacher.<br /> <br />“Height: 173 cm. Weight: 66 kg. Sitting height: 90 cm.”<br /> <br />“Quite a growth spurt,”<br /> <br />Compared to the results from the previous year, he had grown by four centimeters.<br /> <br />It felt like his eye level had risen just a bit.<br /> <br />Thinking that his growth spurt might be coming to an end, Saito was surprised to find out that it was still ongoing.<br /> <br />A bit amazed at the unexpected results, Saito couldn’t help but let out an impressed sigh.<br /> <br />“Let me see, Saito.”<br /> <br />“Sure, here you go.”<br /> <br />His friend Kai seemed curious about the results.<br /> <br />Kai who was waiting outside the classroom, asked him to show her the record sheets.<br /> <br />Since Saito wasn’t a girl and there was no embarrassing information to hide, he showed it without hesitation.<br /> <br />“That’s huge. There’s about a twenty-centimeter difference.”<br /> <br />“I didn’t expect such a gap. I thought Kai was a bit taller.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, true. This data seems unbelievable. I demand a re-measurement.”<br /> <br />While Saito thought Kai was somewhat petite for a guy, he never expected a twenty-centimeter difference.<br /> <br />Acknowledging it, Saito suggested a re-measurement, and Kai eagerly tried to head to the infirmary.<br /> <br />However, another person present grabbed his shoulder, preventing him from doing so.<br /> <br />“I get that you want to exaggerate, but Kai-kun asked for a [one more time] several times, so I don’t think it’s going to change.”<br /> <br />“Stop with the logical punches.”<br /> <br />According to Haruki, it seemed they had already requested several re-measurements.<br /> <br />Indeed, it was unlikely to change.<br /> <br />However, unable to accept reality, Kai covered his ears as if to block out the information.<br /> <br />Saito and Haruki exchanged glances and shared a laugh about Kai’s antics.<br /> <br />“Hey, how did you guys do? Show me, show me!”<br /> <br />“Sure thing.”<br /> <br />Returning to the classroom, Saito was approached by Shuri Yakumo, a gal with reddish-brown hair.<br /> <br />Following behind her were two seemingly quiet girls, Lily and Kanzaki Minaka.<br /> <br />Lately, when Saito wasn’t talking to her, Lily often chatted with Kanzaki and Shuri.<br /> <br />“Wow, Saito, you’re 173 cm tall. Huge! Kai is tiny, around 155 cm and cute. Haruki is, well, just average, I guess.”<br /> <br />“Am I the only one getting treated roughly here!?”<br /> <br />“Don’t worry.”<br /> <br />Observing the results, each of them shared their thoughts.<br /> <br />Shuri expressed her impressions, but Haruki, the only one with a lackluster response, protested, wondering if there was something more.<br /> <br />However, considering Haruki’s average height and weight, it was challenging to come up with additional comments compared to the others.<br /> <br />“Lily, how about your height?”<br /> <br />Taking note of Haruki’s shock, Saito asked Lily about her results.<br /> <br />In the past, he would have asked to see the recording sheet, but thanks to the influence of Yabana and Riri, he now focused only on height.<br /> <br />“I grew a bit. About 5 centimeters.”<br /> <br />“Isn’t that just within the margin of error?”<br /> <br />“The ones place changed, so it’s a proper growth. Unlike Saito, growing four centimeters is weird.”<br /> <br />“Hey, I’ve been growing a lot lately. Finally surpassed you. You’ve been treating me like a shorty all this time. Get ready, shorty. Hey, shorty. Oh, where did Lily go? Can’t see her, she’s too short.”<br /> <br />“Ugh, knew this would happen, didn’t want to lose.”<br /> <br />As of last year, they were almost the same height.<br /> <br />However, with a slight difference, Saito was still considered short, facing the usual treatment.<br /> <br />But this year, the tables finally turned.<br /> <br />Saito, fueled by years of resentment, taunted relentlessly, and Lily bit her lip in frustration.<br /> <br />“Oh, rare sight. Lily getting all frustrated. Unusual.”<br /> <br />“…Yeah.”<br /> <br />Seeing their friend in an unusual state, Kanzaki and Shuri were surprised.<br /> <br />“By the way, Shuri, do you know the ideal height difference?”<br /> <br />“Of course, I know. It’s about fifteen centimeters. Around that makes it easy for kisses and hugs.”<br /> <br />After Saito finished his teasing, the conversation shifted to more feminine topics.<br /> <br />“Fifteen centimeters. That means a hundred and forty centimeters.”<br /> <br />“It might be quicker to look for the reverse.”<br /> <br />“Then, in my case, it’s a hundred and seventy-seven. Seems challenging to find. Oh, but Minachi is a hundred and fifty-eight, so it’s just right with for you.”<br /> <br />“What!?”<br /> <br />“Tsk.”<br /> <br />“Tsk!? Did you just click your tongue? Seriously, isn’t that too much?”<br /> <br />“Probably misheard. Can you stop with the paranoia?”<br /> <br />As they discussed their ideal height differences, Saito, who had just been teased, is shocked when he suddenly gets a tongue lashing.<br /> <br />He hadn’t talked much with Kanzaki, and he hadn’t done anything to be disliked.<br /> <br />Did he unintentionally do something wrong?<br /> <br />If so, he wanted to apologize.<br /> <br />Saito didn’t intend to create an awkward atmosphere with Lily’s friends, but judging by the reaction, it seemed difficult.<br /> <br />“It’s not like I’d date someone just because of the ideal height difference. You can adjust a bit with heels. If it’s just right when standing next to each other, that’s fine.”<br /> <br />“Wow, you brought up the topic yourself and said something blunt, Minakachi.”<br /> <br />“It’s fine.”<br /> <br />Clearly displeased, Kanzaki quickly ended the conversation.<br /> <br />The teacher arrived as they were heading back to their seats, and the class disbanded.<br /> <br />“Lily’s turn. Let’s see, the weight is—”<br /> <br />“Don’t look!”<br /> <br />“Cough.”<br /> <br />On the way back to her seat, Saito noticed Lily’s record sheet had fallen, so he picked it up.<br /> <br />With a mischievous thought, he attempted to see her weight, but a fist hit his solar plexus accompanied by a yell.<br /> <br />A perfect hit.<br /> <br />In great pain, Saito let go of the record sheet, realizing that checking a woman’s weight was a taboo.<br /> <br />(Is 59 really that embarrassing?)<br /> <br />However, the faintly visible number suggested that, height-wise, she was quite slim.<br /> <br />Women are creatures he doesn’t understand well. With that thought, Saito let go of his consciousness.<br /> </p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br />A little later, after school.<br /> <br />At the station’s platform, Lily and Saito sat on a bench, waiting for the train home.<br /> <br />“Hey, what about this one? Seems good, right?”<br /> <br />“A waitress at a massage parlor, right? It’s nearby and pays decently, but I’m scared someone like a teacher or acquaintance might come, so I’ll pass.”<br /> <br />“Okay, then what about this M○○ place?”<br /> <br />“It’s quite far from school. It’s too much trouble to commute every day. Actually, now that I think about it, Saito just wants to eat hamburgers cheaply, right? Choose properly without personal feelings.”<br /> <br />“Hey.”<br /> <br />Today’s topic is part-time jobs.<br /> <br />Since we’ve just entered high school and part-time work is now allowed, we’re looking for good job opportunities together. However, it’s proving to be challenging.<br /> <br />The main issues are that our school, Seira High School, prohibits part-time work, and our houses are far apart.<br /> <br />It’s difficult to find a place where both of us can work without getting caught by the teachers.<br /> <br />Seemingly tired of searching midway, Saito starts listing the names of hamburger shops.<br /> <br />“By the way, can you handle customer service?”<br /> <br />“…Probably not.”<br /> <br />“Then it’s a no-go.”<br /> <br />“It’s over.”<br /> <br />In the heat of the moment, they discuss the idea of doing part-time work, but upon reflection, Saito can’t envision Lily, who dislikes men, succeeding in jobs that involve customer service or interacting with people.<br /> <br />Thinking back, she realizes that during her previous part-time job in university, it mainly involved desk work like video editing and advertising, with no experience in customer service.<br /> <br />It seems they were quite stuck during the search phase.<br /> <br />Putting their smartphones back in their pockets, the two become disheartened.<br /> <br />Then, the announcement of the train’s arrival echoes on the platform.<br /> <br />Lily and Saito stand up from the bench and join the queue.<br /> <br />“It’s super crowded, huh?”<br /> <br />“Yeah. Should we wait for the next train?”<br /> <br />“Though there was a huge delay around noon, so it seems like this is the situation for a while.”<br /> <br />“Really?”<br /> <br />The approaching train seems packed to the point where it feels like there’s no room for more people. The two hesitate about whether to board or not.<br /> <br />But after checking on their phones, they find out there was an incident around noon, and waiting for the next one wouldn’t make much difference.<br /> <br />“We have no choice but to get on.”<br /> <br />“That’s the only option.”<br /> <br />So, with determination, the two decide to board the train.<br /> <br />They bow to the people in front of the door and manage to squeeze in, though it’s quite challenging.<br /> <br />The slightest jolt of the train caused their bags and bodies to collide with each other.<br /> <br />“…Hey, stay still. I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />Seeing Riri’s pained expression, Saito muttered softly and slid himself between her and the others, as if protecting her.<br /> <br />“It should be better now.”<br /> <br />(It’s not better at all!)<br /> <br />Certainly, thanks to Saito protecting her, she wouldn’t bump into others as much.<br /> <br />However, his protective stance is more like a so-called “Kabedon.”<br /> <br />A slight movement could make their lips touch, creating an uncomfortably close distance.<br /> <br />It’s her childhood friend, after all. She probably thinks there’s nothing wrong with a Kabedon at this point.<br /> <br />Honestly, that’s what Lily used to think. Not too long ago.<br /> <br />A few years ago, when Saito and her took a trip by train, they experienced a similar situation.<br /> <br />(So close, so close, so close!)<br /> <br />However, there’s a crucial difference between that time and now<br /> <br />—the height difference.<br /> <br />A few years ago, Lily was actually a few centimeters taller than Saito.<br /> <br />So, even with a Kabedon, his face was generally around her chest or just a bit above her neck, and it didn’t bother her much.<br /> <br />This time, it’s the same situation.<br /> <br />Unconsciously, she had already assumed that.<br /> <br />An unexpected hit from the subconscious.<br /> <br />Her head goes into malfunction mode due to the completely unexpected situation.<br /> <br />Her body’s temperature runs wild, and heat rushes to her face at an alarming speed.<br /> <br />—This is bad.<br /> <br />Both reason and instinct warn her that it’s bad for her childhood friend to see her in this state.<br /> <br />In a split second, Lily instinctively turns her face to the side, burying it in Saito’s shoulder.<br /> <br />“What’s wrong all of a sudden?”<br /> <br />“…It’s nothing.”<br /> <br />It’s really nothing at all.<br /> <br />She can’t afford to be exposed like this, especially to her childhood friend.</p>

<p>If she’s caught, she’ll definitely be teased.<br /> <br />Thump, thump—she earnestly wishes her rapidly beating heart would calm down, but it refuses to obey.<br /> <br />In the end, until the moment Lily gets off the train, her heart remains fast-paced, and her body’s heat never subsides.</p>
