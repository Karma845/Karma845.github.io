<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.1</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; It’s cold”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was coming home from a bookstore, rubbing my shivering arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already dark as I had had dinner outside today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer had almost arrived, but it was colder than normal today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s probably because of the unusual weather today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went up the stairs of my apartment, to my house on the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a quick bath and relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped in my tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going up the stairs, one can see the back of the building, from where I was standing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn&#8217;t anything special about it, but I saw something unusual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tachibana-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A figure could be seen standing in front of a room on the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here, you can only see the upper half back of her body because of the railing but that’s definitely Tachibana.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because beautiful girls have a different aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still… pajamas?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn… It’s frustrating that I can’t see the front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana didn’t notice me standing there, rather she kept silent and still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no clue what was happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at the situation for a while, but Tachibana didn’t move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was she waiting for someone?</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or was she locked outside?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think she could be locked out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a hotel where the room auto-locks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I thought about that, I went down the stairs to building B.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went up to the second floor to see a girl in pajamas standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, it’s Tachibana after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a person you knew stood alone in front of a room on such a cold night, anyone would be worried.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it’s just natural to help her out right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not that there&#8217;s something wrong with you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;HA?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to her, Tachibana jumped back to look at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an unusual, distraught expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when she realized that it was me, she looked somewhat relieved and blushed slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s with that reaction?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusuba-san, you surprised me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Same here, you surprised me too. Also, what are you doing here?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I don’t want to say it. It’s not related to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her way of refusing was straightforward as expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, indeed, it’s not related to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was worried and curious but I had no energy to question her until she answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving her, I went back to building A.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana isn’t a child, she can do what she wants.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a peek at building B again as I went up the stairs to building A.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana had still not moved from there, she was standing there like before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sudden cold wind blew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going up the stairs, I saw Tachibana again. She was hugging her body as if she was frozen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Ah, it is cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There must be a light jacket in the closet somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went and got a navy-blue jacket I had worn a few months ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ran down the stairs and went back to the other building and went up to Tachibana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here, take this.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I handed over the jacket to Tachibana while sticking out my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What’s this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Just wear it. Or I can’t stop worrying.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…It’s alright, I don’t need it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was as stubborn as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to persuade her will just be a waste of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I threw my jacket at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana reflexively caught it, as expected.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t need it either. Bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh, hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the question-and-answer session began, I quickly ran away and left her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I returned to my building, I looked toward Tachibana. She had a grudge-like expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My focus was never to be appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I didn’t take much notice of the reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think she should quickly wear that jacket in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I returned home. I boiled some water to eat a cup ramen.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time I had finished and took a break, 30 minutes had passed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has Tachibana gone back in?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left the house to go to the stairway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I didn’t find Tachibana standing there anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just in case…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lost count of how many times I went up and down the stairs today.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was an indoor type student, so it was quite a pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went up the stairs of building A once again and looked towards the house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…and she was there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana was sitting down with her back against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she was hidden under the railings so I couldn’t see her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, she was also wearing my jacket I had lent her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ended up laughing involuntarily as it looked quite funny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?&#8230;.AH?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana finally noticed me and started to take off the jacket in a hurry.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, probably because of the size, it was hard to take out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she was so resolute, she ended up wearing it again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if she was honest or not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s cowardly to sneak a peek!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You were sneaking over there too. You can just wear the jacket, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…It’s cold today, it can’t be helped…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t dare say that it was the reason I lent her the jacket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I did, she would probably pout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ok then, why are you standing out of your house anyway?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s just stop the troublesome discussion of wearing a jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like the other one had similar thoughts. Tachibana’s expression softened, and she spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I went inside my house.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;There was a cockroach.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expression on Tachibana&#8217;s face, surprisingly, was actually a serious one.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.2</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cockroach?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cockroach.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were three.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s quite a lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was a numerical disadvantage. I was forced to move out.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my voice leaked, Tachibana&#8217;s face stiffened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The horror of cockroaches is that you think there is one, but there are actually many. Don’t you even know that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even if there are many, that’s disgusting, not scary.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway, I can’t go to sleep in a place like that. I don’t know where they are, so I was standing outside here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get it, now I can understand the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a cockroach hides, it’s hard to find it again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are probably many.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can’t be ignored</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that’s a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you going to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m still thinking, Unfortunately, today is quite cold.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I realized it, Tachibana had completely covered herself with my jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can’t you contact a friend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I only have 2 friends I can contact in this situation, but both live far from here. And my phone is also in the house.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if they are the ones I saw out of the classroom the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them is Kyoya&#8217;s girlfriend, Hinata Satsuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other being the one wearing glasses who was standing with Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Surprisingly, you only have a few friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The amount does not matter. It’s the trust and intimacy that’s important.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana’s reply was perfect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I completely agree with that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya is the only one I call a friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you have “Barusan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ba-ru-sa-n?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;you don’t know what Barusan is?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eh?! Really?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s Barusan? It’s the best weapon for pest control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well… with it, you can eliminate all the pests in a room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EH? That’s Amazing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, I have a non-smoke model. With it, the smoke alarm of the building doesn’t go off, it’s perfect for apartments.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looked deeply impressed by my speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never meant to say it to show that I’m an amazing person, but I didn’t say that cause I felt cool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes time though, around 2 hours.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm… 2 hours…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana went into serious thought while putting her hand on her chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not an unreasonable time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now when you think of it, more problems spring up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;First of all, who will apply it? And where should we wait?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How does it work?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You just place it in the center of the room and just press on the switch. Oh, also, you have to cover the TV, got it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I asked if she understood, she shook her head.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face was pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seems like she really hates cockroaches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then you have no choice but to ask someone who doesn’t mind cockroaches. Do you want to call someone on my phone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I don’t remember my friend&#8217;s number. And it’s not a good idea to call at this time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, I see… so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were both standing in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe we were thinking of the same thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meaning, that I should go instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, needless to say, there are a few issues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mainly, the laundry…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s not a good idea for me to propose.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I ask in the wrong manner, it might seem that I am using an excuse to take advantage of the situation to enter her house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my innocence, I shall leave the decision to Tachibana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I had thought to keep silent&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusuba-san, I’m sorry, but can I ask you for a favor…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nod reflexively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But… Is that really a good idea?</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.3</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Alright, I’ve set up the Barusen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, it was decided that Tachibana will come over to my place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, obviously, things that shouldn’t be seen were hidden in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I cleaned the room a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because it’s usually really untidy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as people don’t come over, I’ll be able to live comfortably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes… That’s really good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You are making a scary face…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or is it a dreadful expression?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, there was nothing particular in Tachibana’s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no laundry or clothes thrown around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word, “tidy” would be appropriate.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…That’s given.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or you would’ve never allowed me into your room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here, your smartphone, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh… yes, Sorry for the trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, It’s alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had just found the smartphone on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I picked it up. It had the nice smell of futons on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I didn’t smell it voluntarily of course.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t have a smartphone case on it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it’s much easier to handle this way. If you don’t drop it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…That’s true”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet again, I was surprised, I have the same view as hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, our thoughts strangely overlap each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to be surprised anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you again, Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana sat upright on the cushion and bowed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Sitting in “Seiza”. Then bowed.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don’t worry about it, I don’t use Barusen anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Really? Why do you have it then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My father gave it to me when I started living alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what else did he give…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good futon or a good chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was cursing at my father’s lack of common sense, I suddenly realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I was so late to realize was that it was too normal for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusuba-san also lives alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well… so do you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There aren’t many high school students who live alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, as well we share in common.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I am living alone is because my father wanted me to get “life power”.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/48BDNY0/195956.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… I definitely haven’t got any of it till now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will return your favor in the near future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don’t need to… well, even if I say that, I don’t think you’ll listen to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. That’s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s pretty clear from the lunch incident that it&#8217;s useless to argue with her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be safer to take the favor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana avoided my eye contact and looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I looked around my room, she continued to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think you’re a good person…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Thanks.”</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.4</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the day after I put “Barusen” in Tachibana’s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyoya didn’t come and talk to me so today’s lunch break was quiet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out the bread I had bought from my bag and started chewing it while fiddling with my smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being who I am, I’m really grateful that using a phone here is allowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school rules are not so strict, probably because it’s anyway a good school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I eat my meal quietly, not being called by anyone around me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the center of the class, Kyoya is having fun with several guys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the hallway, I saw many students walking past heading somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who get lunch boxes tend to go to the courtyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only normies can go to such a place filled with people like themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have never gone to the courtyard before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor do I want to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was watching the hallway, a familiar figure came past.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aura that can be seen clearly in the sea of students is, of course, Tachibana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Kyoya’s girlfriend, Suzuki Hinata was present with another girl who was wearing glasses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just the appearance of these 3 people, the corridor became much brighter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This the ability of a beautiful girl…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kyoya, let&#8217;s get going.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, coming.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinata called Kyoya in the classroom from the door, while Kyoya left the classroom with a lunch box in his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just looking around, but my eyes met Tachibana&#8217;s, who was standing nearby.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I could redirect my eyes, Tachibana gave me a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is definitely looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After some hesitation, I nod back at her twice, giving a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though there are people around, I still can’t just ignore her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is as polite as always.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana and her friends then went away for lunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I woke at the sound of the doorbell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it for the newspaper subscription?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look at the intercom camera while rubbing my tired eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, suddenly, all my drowsiness disappears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rika Tachibana was standing outside with something like a plastic bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What on earth…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I went to the front door and opened it, I saw Tachibana relieved and loosened her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good evening.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Good Morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: He’s just drowsy, as he was sleeping, it’s evening.)</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had planned to visit you earlier, but I didn’t know how to return the favor, so I was late. I’m really sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I heard her voice, speaking quickly without stopping, it seemed like it was on her head for some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that was the story&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really appreciate what you did yesterday, Thank you very much. There are no signs of the cockroaches in the room anymore.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, that’s a relief. Seriously, use a cockroach trap next time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, my friend had told me that. It’s already been installed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have a smart friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t mind, can I come in?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Here, see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana brought out her palm and showed me a bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a bag from the supermarket that I use a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside were various vegetables and chicken meat along with curry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I saw you cook yesterday, I understood your eating habits. So, I decided that the best way to repay the favor was to cook a nutrition balanced diet for you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was really impressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I still hadn’t forgotten that taste of Tachibana’s bento from the last favor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a weird story, but to be able to eat her homemade food again…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No… That’s too much. The favors are not equal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…? Is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said that, Tachibana became wide-eyed and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me, it’s still not enough. Our values are different, so for both of us to be satisfied is quite hard,”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s true…but…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don’t think too much about it. We’re friends, so as you helped me, I&#8217;m just returning your favor by cooking for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? Friends… us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said in a stupid voice because Tachibana unexpectedly said these words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are friends?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana and me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the very least, I do think so. I don’t know about Kusuba-san.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana replied after those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a direct statement, with no hesitation to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will not be discussing that, because I don’t think clarifying the relationship is worth it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana slipped past me and went into the house, not wanting to be questioned by me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…surprisingly stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…somehow, It looks much more untidy than yesterday.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well… I’ll be borrowing your kitchen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana wore an apron she had brought along and moved steadily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is good at cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe she is used to it so she doesn’t mind it much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Tachibana was cooking, I decided to clean the place a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so untidy, that there was no space for Tachibana to sit down.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Tachibana came over to my house to serve me food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a strange way to step forward in the relationship.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.5</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By the way… I forgot to buy the barusen as I used yours.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No no. It’s okay. I didn’t use it anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then I’ll make up for it with something else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What ‘something else’.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll think about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana talks to me while she continues to cook.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was getting more and more excited as I had not been told what she was cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway, how can you enter a boy’s hose so carelessly? Aren’t you afraid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a topic I didn’t want to speak of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I can’t just stay still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If it is any boy, then yes. But not when it’s Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, what does that mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I not a normal boy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a risk if something happens. But some people don’t understand it and do stupid things. But Kusubu-san isn’t like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;oh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like I couldn’t breathe properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I just get a compliment?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just take it as “Trusted” for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But you’re such a beautiful girl, it’s better if you are a bit cautious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Involuntarily, my true thoughts leaked out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana didn’t seem disgusted as I had thought she would, rather, she didn’t seem to care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe such compliments are common for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In such a situation, I will take a defensive stance according to the situation. But It’s not the time to do that right now.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An exceptionally simple response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, it’s been 16 years for this girl, so she might have already gone through such situations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm…That’s a lot of food.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While looking over to Tachibana’s hand cooking food, I was neither happy nor surprised by the amount of food.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I made it so it can be stored, so I cooked a lot of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh… nice idea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll last around 3 days, you will probably finish it before you get bored eating it.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she finished speaking, Tachibana removed the frying pan and started to place all the dishes on the plate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used all our serving dishes to place the food as there were a lot of dishes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Done.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An aroma that makes you hungry comes from the dishes placed there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They look really good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bacon and vegetable curry stir fry and Negimayo Chicken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh… It looks really good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said that, Tachibana’s hand extended to her waist as she slightly puffs her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, it was really adorable and cute.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rice, by the way, was warmed in the microwave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of us sit across each other and hold our hands together.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“”Itadakimasu”.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The food was delicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had just said that it tasted good with rice, but my chopsticks couldn’t stop, especially for the Negimayo Chicken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was really delicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looked really happy.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, even I am quite satisfied. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To eat this food again, I’ll burn as much Barusen I can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm… I wonder if the cockroaches will come out again…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana, of course, had a strange expression on her face.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.6</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gochisosamadeshita.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was delicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both bowed our heads at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so delicious that I couldn’t stop eating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep the rest in the refrigerator, you’ll be able to eat it again if you heat it in the microwave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright, got it…Thank you, really.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: instead of “Hai”, he said “Hyai”, I didn’t know what to translate it as)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That answer was suspicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cup noodles and pasta are the companions of boys living alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a typical bad habit, don’t you ever cook for yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s troublesome.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I am saying such a thing because your complexion looks pale, and so do your eyes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana looks surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a feeling that I have said something unusual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or is she serious about being worried about me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Does Tachibana cook well?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well…as it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As it is, hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can cook such delicious food, what do you mean by, “As it is”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, Tachibana is a ridiculously beautiful girl, who can cook. Isn’t that already way too high?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, she can study as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she is afraid of cockroaches, that can be taken as an advantage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only downside can be that we are a bit similar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meal, Tachibana doesn’t show any signs of returning to her apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s rude to just tell her to go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s just wait and see what happens.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now that I remember, Tachibana-san isn’t doing any club activities, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, I don’t have any interest in them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana answered the personal question that I had asked as a trail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if she is an open person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm… What do you usually do at home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Read a book, watch a movie, then study.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was surprisingly normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… Tachibana might be quite pretty, but she is still a high school girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What does Kusuba-san do?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Either eat or sleep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Studies?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do studies count? Did you count studying?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did that earlier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, come to think of it, you did.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After your studies, what else do you do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eat or sleep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana tried to endure it but yet giggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like I had done something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: As in getting closer)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, Tachibana and I started talking like friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So many things have happened in the last few days that it couldn’t be helped…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Kusuba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe I’m just in high spirits…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tachibana is happy and calm as she says, &#8220;I think you’re a good person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, I have to immediately calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I’m sure it will be a source of regret and disappointment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would probably do something unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you actually hate me, tell me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;No, really.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Tachibana answered, I thought she had a suspicious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is there a reason for me to hate you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No… but… I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was speechless. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I’m disgusting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I’m dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it’s obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be a tough game,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what I told Tachibana, I felt like she would just tilt her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…but, I am grateful to you and don’t have a bad impression of you. I like talking to you here, like today. If you don’t like it, I won&#8217;t come here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no hesitation or a hint of deception in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, it seemed like she spoke from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to purge these expectations I have in me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I asked this question was to be rejected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to be honest, I might have been waiting to hear this answer all this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;you’re strange, Tachibana.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way as much as you.”</span></p>
