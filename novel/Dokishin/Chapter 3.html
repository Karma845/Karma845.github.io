<h3>Chapter 3</h3>


<p>After buying the quarterstaff and armor, I walked around the city.<br />
My next destination was the inn.<br />
I called the map from the menu and checked the position.<br />
The recommended inn was not so far away. I started walking down the cobblestone boulevard.<br />
There were not many people with long ears like Louise. Not to mention that cat.<br />
There were beastkin with animal ears and tails, but there were not many of them either. Were they a minority?<br />
The townscape itself resembled medieval Europe, and it seemed that there were overwhelmingly more stone buildings than wooden buildings like the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild.<br />
The fact that there were many stone houses meant that there were not many earthquakes in the area. Since if it was made of stone, it would be dangerous when the building collapsed.<br />
How many people lived here? As far as the map was concerned, it&#8217;s quite large, and it seemed that a few days might be required for just exploring this city.</p>
<p>[Hoo&#8230;]</p>
<p>When I arrived at the central square of the city, I exclaimed in admiration.<br />
It reminded me of the crowds in Tokyo. Just replace all the vehicles with horse-drawn carriages.<br />
Looked more like an angry mob than the regular hustle bustle.<br />
For the time being, I didn&#8217;t want to be run over by a carriage when I&#8217;m stuck in an unfamiliar crowd, so I walked to the corner of the square.</p>
<p>The city of Crossroads was divided into four districts, north, south, east and west, centered on this central square.<br />
First of all, I’m in the eastern district.<br />
It seems to be a commercial district where adventurer guilds, merchant guilds, and various shops were gathered.<br />
The north area seemed to be a place where wealthy people lived. The south district on the other side was a district where ordinary people and the so-called poor people lived.<br />
It seemed that there were churches, government offices, and garrisons of the Kingdom Army in the west district.<br />
The inn I was heading to was located near the central square in the south district.</p>
<p>Shortly after, I arrived at the desired inn.<br />
There was no doubt that the bright red anvil sign that read 『Burning Anvil Pavilion』 was meant to be a landmark.<br />
When I went inside, a very short but unusually stiff old man was looking at something that looked like a lodging book.<br />
In the space that looks like a dining room in the back, I saw what appeared to be the guest eating.<br />
The old man immediately noticed me and smiled with a smile that anyone would love.</p>
<p>[Welcome to the Scorching Anvil Pavilion. Looking for accommodations?]</p>
<p>[Oh, I was introduced to the receptionist of the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild. I want to get myself a room, but how much is it per night?]</p>
<p>[If you&#8217;re introduced by the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild, it’ll be two large bronze coins and five bronze coins per night with breakfast. If you eat at home during the day and night, you can order plate service.]</p>
<p>I still didn&#8217;t understand the sense of money in this world.<br />
However, considering the price of weapons and armor, I felt that it wasn’t so expensive.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;ll book the room for ten days for the time being.]</p>
<p>[That will be two silver coins and five large bronze coins.]</p>
<p>I understand how coins work.<br />
Considering the exchange at the armor store earlier, I deduced that 10 bronze coins = 1 large bronze coin, 10 large bronze coins = 1 silver coin, 10 silver coins = 1 gold coin.<br />
The large silver coin seems to be an intermediate coin, so one large silver coin = five silver coins.<br />
Should I do some testing?</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>[Will this be OK.]</p>
<p>[If it&#8217;s a big silver coin, then here is the change of 2 silver coins and 5 big bronze coins. I need you to show your Adventurer card, so that I can record it in the lodge book.]</p>
<p>Apparently my prediction was correct.<br />
After that, I got a good grasp of the economy once I knew the value of one bronze coin.<br />
And my balance has decreased a lot, so the immediate goal will be information gathering and making money.<br />
There was already that case with the magic catalyst. If I don’t learn the common sense of this world as soon as possible, I may get into unexpected troubles.</p>
<p>[Hey, Phina! Guide the customer to his room!]</p>
<p>The old man who had finished recording the receipt and checking the adventurer card called out to the dining room in the back.<br />
It&#8217;s a big voice, he might be a dwarf or something, not just a human being, considering his plump body shape.</p>
<p>[Yes!]</p>
<p>A girl wearing a cute apron ran from the dining room in the back with a cheerful voice.<br />
She’s small, so maybe around 10 years old? She’s only as tall as my waist.</p>
<p>[Customer-san, I&#8217;ll show you to your room. Follow me.]</p>
<p>I climbed the stairs to the second floor while following this girl called Phina.<br />
The steps were quite low. Was it made to suit the manager to some extent?</p>
<p>The room I was guided to was a room facing the street. It&#8217;s not sunny now, but the light still comes in from the window. The beds are clean, and there&#8217;s no problem getting up.<br />
Is it about 5 tatami mats wide? It didn’t feel that big because there was a bed.<br />
There was a simple table next to the window facing the street. I think it can be used to write or something else.<br />
The floor was made of wood, but there is no creaking noise. The boards were probably thick.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s a good room, the beds and the room are beautiful.]</p>
<p>[You can expect good things from our food, because dwarven food is perfect for Adventurers.]</p>
<p>With that said, Phina smiled.<br />
It&#8217;s a pleasant smile.<br />
For this presentation, my answer was obvious.</p>
<p>[Well, I wonder if I&#8217;ll get it right away. Can I still order for lunch?]</p>
<p>[Of course, I will prepare one plate.]</p>
<p>Receiving the key, I stored the quarter staff in storage, and moved downstairs again.<br />
There were many people dressed like adventurers in the cafeteria, probably because they were guests.<br />
As far as the equipment is concerned, every adventurer looked much more veteran than I was.<br />
I felt a little floaty in my brand new equipment.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>[Yes, daily set meals. 3 bronze coins.]</p>
<p>I paid three bronze coins to Phina, who put the food on the tray. Then I started eating my first ever meal in another world.<br />
The menu was cabbage-like vegetables, stir-fried offal, vegetable soup, and black bread.<br />
The stir-fried food has a taste similar to that of miso stir-fry, and although it is a little thick, the food goes through rather easily.<br />
The cabbage-like vegetables were chewy, and the offal seemed to be fried with garlic or something, and the aroma was good.<br />
On the contrary, the soup is light. The black bread is so hard that I had to dip it a little before I could eat it. It seems that other people are eating like that as well.<br />
By the way, the one-dish service seems to be this soup.</p>
<p>[Well, what should I do next?]</p>
<p>Do I want to take a rest today or wander around the city?<br />
Thinking about it, the menu hasn&#8217;t been touched yet, so why don&#8217;t I go back to the room and take things slowly?<br />
Then, if I have time, I can go to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild again to train the quarterstaff, or go out and hunt the wild boar.</p>
<p>[Thank you for the meal, I&#8217;ll take a rest in the room.]</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>After calling out to Phina who was working in the kitchen, I returned to my room.<br />
When I opened the menu, I only realized now that my level went up. Is it the result of the simulated battle?<br />
The growth of STR, VIT, and AGI is good, probably because of the effect of strengthening the body. On the contrary, the value of DEX hardly increased.<br />
The growth of POW is similar to the status of physical strengthening.<br />
My maximum HP was 69 and MP was 164. I think they’re related to VIT and POW, but the increased values were 13 and 17 respectively.<br />
It didn’t match the value increased this time. I&#8217;m not sure about the specifications around here.<br />
And although I used my skill points, it increased by 6 points now.<br />
If I focus on one skill, I can get it up to level 3, but I think it is better to acquire more skills for wider versatility.</p>
<p>Am I being too careful? No, this is fine. I don&#8217;t seek romance, emphasizing on efficiency.<br />
I don&#8217;t want to die.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s set the polearm mastery to level 2 so that I can handle the new quarterstaff well.<br />
With the remaining 3 points, I could acquire magical power enhancement, magic power recovery, and pure magic at level 1.<br />
MP increased from 164 to 246 at once just by taking level 1 of magic power enhancement. It&#8217;s the same as physical strengthening, 1.5 times multiplier.<br />
I wondered if POW would increase, but it turned out that it’s only MP that got increased.<br />
When calculating the recovery speed, it seems that the speed of magic recovery, which originally required a whole day for complete recovery, has now increased by 1.5 times.<br />
Currently, 1 MP recovers every 4 minutes&#8230; I can&#8217;t rapid fire magic for a long time. I have to think of some means of recovery.<br />
It seemed that I could now use the magic arrow at level 1 of pure magic.<br />
When I shot one through the window toward the sky, it seemed to be a magical arrow with no particular attributes.<br />
The versatility may be high because it had no attributes.</p>
<p>After learning and verifying the skills to some extent, let&#8217;s play with the menu interface.<br />
It seems that some items can be displayed at all times by playing with the options.<br />
For the time being, the bar showing HP and MP, the direction, and the mini map were always displayed.</p>
<p>I checked the contents of my inventory again.<br />
First of all, the Adventurer set.<br />
There were various tools that could be used for adventures in the knapsack.<br />
Blankets, torches, tinderboxes, knives, ropes for 10 meters.<br />
After that, there were 1 large silver coin, 6 silver coins, 18 large copper coins, and 17 copper coins.<br />
I also had one small-boar fur, one small-boar flesh, two small-boar corpses, and one big hornet corpse.<br />
After that, there are three preserved foods packaged with dried meat, dried fruits, and campan, and one water in a leather water bag.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how much the inventory can store, but judging from how there is no weight display, it may not be necessary to consider the weight or size.<br />
If you put things in one bag like the adventurer set, it seems to be recognized as an item.<br />
Two small-boar corpses are also stacked in one slot. This looks like it&#8217;s pretty convenient.<br />
However, considering that a carriage loaded with luggage was running in the city, this may not be a general ability.<br />
But with this, I won&#8217;t be needing a wagon to carry my stuff around.<br />
However, it is also necessary to find out how much it is tolerated. Let&#8217;s take the item out of the inventory and show it at some store.</p>
<p>It was 3:00 pm when I finally stopped playing around with the menu.<br />
Speaking of collecting items, did you know that the items in the storage of the tool column can be made to appear at the tip of your hand just by thinking about it?<br />
Also, I couldn&#8217;t press the Call God option.<br />
It&#8217;s okay to mess around as it is, but since it&#8217;s free time, let&#8217;s go to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild and see what kind of request there is.<br />
If I can sell corpses, fur, meat, etc., all the better.<br />
No, should I buy some salt to make salted meat instead?<br />
No, will it rot if left in the inventory? Well, I have to experiment a lot.</p>
<p>I greeted the old man and Phina who were preparing dinner then headed for the adventurer&#8217;s guild.<br />
MP was at 37, recovering to about the same level as when I first went to the guild.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[Oh, you&#8217;re starting to look more like an adventurer, huh?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>As soon as I entered the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild, I waved to the Ossan at the reception table and looked at the bulletin board for a request.<br />
It seems safe to go from something like a messenger in the city to something like a patrol around the city.<br />
Maybe I shouldn’t go with something so mundane.<br />
Next, the extermination of vermin and monsters that lived nearby. The risk level of this was pretty high, but it seemed that the risk was well managed.<br />
After all, the most dangerous kinds were quests to go to a place where you do not know where and what will attack, collect various items, or subdue monsters.<br />
When I was looking for a quest that could be done immediately, I found a quest to procure a small boar.<br />
Apparently, it was required as an ingredient.</p>
<p>The required number is one, what a coincidence.</p>
<p>I removed the request form from the bulletin board and took it to the receptionist ossan.</p>
<p>[Ossan, I want to accept this request.]</p>
<p>[My name is Woz. Which one? Small-boar procurement? It might be dangerous if you&#8217;re not careful.]</p>
<p>[Actually, I already hunted some.]</p>
<p>Saying that, I showed the small-bore corpse I directly took out from inventory.</p>
<p>[Whoa! The counter will get dirty with blood! Put it over at that special counter!]</p>
<p>[Sorry.]</p>
<p>I apologized obediently and re-store the small-bore corpse in the inventory.<br />
Old man Woz moved to the other counter dedicated to receiving requested items, so I followed him and took out the small-boar corpse again.<br />
It was still warm because it was stored immediately after being killed.<br />
Is it still warm? That may mean that there is no time lapse in the storage.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s rare to see someone with a treasure box.]</p>
<p>[Treasure box?]</p>
<p>When I asked him back, Woz gave me a strange look.</p>
<p>[You took the corpse out of nothing, right? Isn&#8217;t it a treasure box?]</p>
<p>[O, oh. So it&#8217;s called a treasure box. I learned from an old man who taught me magic in the countryside, but he told me it’s called inventory.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[Hmm. Well, I&#8217;m not so familiar with magic anyway.]</p>
<p>Woz inspected the corpse of a small-bore without showing any particular concern.<br />
I wondered if the inspection was over, since he had another guild staff member bring the corpse of the small boar to the back.</p>
<p>[Yeah, no problem. The request has been fulfilled.]</p>
<p>Old man Woz stamped the request slip and gave me five large bronze coins as a reward.<br />
Hmm, it feels good to have a real income.</p>
<p>[I have one more small-bore corpse and one roll of fur. There are also big hornet corpses. Can I sell them here?]</p>
<p>[Hmm, show me. If it&#8217;s in good condition, I’ll buy it for five large bronze coins.]</p>
<p>[Excuse me.]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter of finding a good prey, but with just this, I earned one silver coin because I had ten large bronze coins.<br />
Isn&#8217;t it worse than I expected to earn, isn&#8217;t it an adventurer&#8217;s business?</p>
<p>[You did pretty good for the first day. I have high expectations.]</p>
<p>Old man Woz grinned and tapped my shoulder as he returned to the reception counter.<br />
The grinning face of that old man came without any unpleasant premonitions&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what kind of unreasonable pretense he would make.<br />
After the short exchanges, I decided to practice with the quarterstaff at the training ground.</p>
<p>Thrust, lift, swing down, smashing while spinning and kicking backwards, slamming while diving.<br />
If I combined attack magic to eliminate the gap further&#8230; Yeah, this may be easier to use than I think.<br />
It seems that I can handle spears and any long-handled weapon thanks to the polearm mastery skill, isn&#8217;t it a more advantageous skill than sword mastery?<br />
The bottleneck is that it is difficult to use in a small space.</p>
<p>[Fuh.]</p>
<p>After confirming the movement, I sat down on the bench in the corner of the training ground and took a break.<br />
Umm, I should’ve prepared a towel or something.<br />
Now that I think about it, I don’t even have any change of clothes. I have to buy it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Excuse me, can I have a minute?]</p>
<p>I heard someone speaking to me while I was thinking with a water bag in my hand.<br />
Looking up, I saw a girl wearing leather armor standing in front of me.<br />
She has a brown ponytail. Her patchy eyes shone, probably due to curiosity.<br />
Her facial features were well-shaped. She was quite a beautiful woman.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly how old she is because she looked like a westerner, but probably not even 20 years old yet.</p>
<p>[Can I help you?]</p>
<p>While storing the water bag back in the inventory, I quickly turned around and followed her line of sight.<br />
Is it about those two suspicious looking people over there?</p>
<p>[That&#8230;umm, with me&#8230;]</p>
<p>For some reason she’s trembling and looking down.<br />
I thought she had an anxiety attack, but I wonder if I think too much.</p>
<p>[Hmm&#8230;go on?]</p><p>When I said that, she looked up and said out loud,</p>
<p>[Please go out with me !!]</p>
<p>The training ground went silent right after.<br />
Piercing gazes were directed at me.<br />
How did this even happen?</p>
