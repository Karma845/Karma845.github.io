<h3>Chapter 3: The Lie That Reveals the Truth, the Facts Filtering Through the Trees</h3>

<p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Nina was able to get out of bed before the alarm clock started ringing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Her body felt sluggish all over, probably because she had hardly slept at all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">She had made the fatal mistake of arranging a &lt;duel&gt; with Jin yesterday in front of the fountain where she had snuck out of the party and headed to.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">With no psychic abilities, she had no other way to survive except to ward off all kinds of battles by using a variety of fear-inducing stories and her sophisticated acting skills.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Surely, it was all because of that welcome party.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">She somehow managed to get through it by mobilizing all her social skills, but the guilt of hiding her true self has always haunted her. The more people around her smiled at her, the more alienation she felt.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">It was because she was suffering from such an irrepressible sense of alienation that she was unable to maintain her composure at that time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">However, that is no excuse.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The only thing she needed to think about now was a strategy to get Jin to leave the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Letting out her first sigh of the day, Nina finally started getting ready for the morning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">While she was fixing her hair and applying her makeup in front of the dressing table, she couldn't shake off her bad thoughts of being exposed for all the lies she had committed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Ugh.......... What should I do?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">What if my slow and steady-acting threats didn't work?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Or what if he attacked out of desperation?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Nina, who had no abilities of any kind, could no longer do anything about it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">She might only lose a mere 95 points.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">But the cost of having her secret exposed would be far greater. In the blink of an eye, the Heiberg School would question her and expel her without excuse.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">What awaits her after that is only a gruesome [punishment] by the Stingray family.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, crap!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Subconsciously, her fingers trembled.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The next thing she knew, her makeup had become distorted all over.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">There was still time, so she would have to wash her face once and start over.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">While making sure no one was home and heading to the shared washroom, Nina kept desperately searching for a way to win the &lt;duel&gt;. She shrank back every time she heard the sound of the alarm clock from the other children's rooms, all the while shaking off the worst images of being torn to shreds and thrown away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The moment she saw her own pale face in front of the mirror, a flash of inspiration flashed through her mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">She checked the clock on the wall. There was still more than an hour until classes</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"......Okay, there's still time!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Nina stopped removing her makeup and hurried back to her room.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre29">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre29"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">It was a laughably difficult morning to wake up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The sheets were soggy with night sweats even though it was not summer, and the joints of his body were creaking even though it was not the day after he had worked out. His legs wobbled when he got out of the hard bed, which was not funny, and he almost screamed when he stumbled over a bag lying at his feet.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Last night, between that fountain and his return to his dorm room, Jin berated himself repeatedly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">This disqualified him from being a con artist.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">He had lost his composure and had ruined the elaborate plan that he had worked so hard to put together. He would not only never reach his final goal, but he would be the first of his classmates to drop out of the competition.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">In a daze, Jin changed into his school uniform and headed downstairs to the cafeteria.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The cafeteria was crowded with boys from the same class whose names he did not know, and the hustle and bustle disturbed his eardrums. Apparently, a group had formed after yesterday's party, and there were only a few students who were eating alone and silently.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">He had no appetite, so as he stood in line to get a glass of water, he felt a myriad of stares poking him in the back.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"He's the first one to drop out, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"...... Poor guy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"It's wrong of him to pick a fight with such a monster. I have no sympathy for him."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"You can say that again, he's an idiot beyond saving."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">With each whispers that he heard, which contained no intention to conceal them, Jin's expression changed to that of a sick person who has been told he does not have long to live.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Taking a seat in the corner with the glass he received, Jin once again cursed his mistake.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Certainly, in the search for the &lt;shepherd dog&gt;, it would be inevitable to confront Nina, the most likely candidate.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">However, Nina is a monster who has been the subject of many sinister rumors, such as that she caused a landslide with her ability when she was a child, and that because she cannot control her ability, she has decided to only use it against people she is willing to kill. To make an enemy out of this monster at such an early stage would be a completely bad idea.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">No matter how he looks at it, she is not an opponent that he can prepare a countermeasure against by tomorrow.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"...... Hey, you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">A male student with a dubious expression gestured to Jin's hand.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">When Jin looked at him fearfully, he saw that his hand holding the cup was shaking like a joke, and the spilled water had created a puddle on the table. The cup was now only about half full.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre29">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre29">Don't tell me, am I scared? Me?</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The shiver grew worse as he became aware of his fear, and he felt a chill slowly creep up his spine.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Well, you know. ...... Don't get killed."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">With a benevolent expression, he placed a hand on Jin's shoulder and the boy backed away as if to run away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"W-What's wrong, Jin-kun? Your face is so pale......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">As soon as he entered the classroom, Emma Licorice approached him with a concerned look.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">She interrupted her conversation with her other friends to follow him to the corner of the classroom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, you don't look well at all! Let's go to the infirmary!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"I'm okay, no worries!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"W-Where are you looking at, Jin-kun? You're looking at the wall!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"I'm fine, really. Thanks for everything."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Get yourself together! You're not the kind of person to thank others!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">As he regained control of his wobbly position, he looked around and noticed that the damned monster was nowhere to be seen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">He checked again and again just to be sure, but Nina was still nowhere to be seen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">W-What? Was it she who got scared and ran away?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Jin managed to regain his composure as he leaned on these faint hopes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">However, the gossip of the boys sitting nearby shattered his hopes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Come to think of it, I don't see Nina Stingray around. Has she gone absent early in the school year?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"She's going to have a &lt;duel&gt; with that Easterner called Jin, right? I heard she's been holed up in the mountains to raise her spirit so that she can crush him thoroughly."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal10"></p><div class="calibre30"><span class="calibre19"><span class="calibre7">"Hae~, so scary. How could someone make an enemy of such a person?"</span></span></div><p class="sc-bdvvtl"></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">His vision almost went dark all at once, but Jin somehow managed to hold on through sheer force of will.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">By the end of the afternoon class, Jin was beginning to regain his usual aloof demeanor.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps one of the reasons for this was that the lectures on the history of research on psychic abilities and the techniques of mental unification had been too boring.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">What he needed to do was the same as before.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Just be calm and relentless and think of a deception strategy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">With skill, experience, and dense malice, he could simply overcome the predicament with ease. It is against the teachings of that person to get flustered when a plan goes a little awry.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, may I have a word?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">He was called out at the same time as the chime sounded.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Emma Licorice waved at him with a smile and had a new friend by her side that she had made today.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">She has striking red hair and imposing black eyes. Of course, this was someone Jin had never spoken to before.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">It was the red-haired girl who opened her mouth first.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Are you Jin?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"......Yeah. And you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"I'm Kate. By the way, Emma told me about you. Are you really going up against that Nina Stingray?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Just in case, Jin decided to raise his alert level.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Yeah, can you give me some advice?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Advice, huh......" The girl named Kate looked at Emma hesitantly. "We were just talking about that just now."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Emma opened her mouth, and took over the conversation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, let's go apologize to Nina-chan!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Huh? ...... Why?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Of course, if he just wanted to get away with it this time, that might be possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">The rule of the &lt;duel&gt; is that it cannot be carried out unless both parties agree to it and include it in their written oath, so it would be possible to withdraw at this point. Even if the apology is not accepted, the duel can be unilaterally canceled at this point.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">But what will happen after that?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Once he is labeled as a coward, no matter what kind of deception he tries from now on, he will no longer have any persuasive power.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">That will not do.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">In order to complete his grand plan, he would have to convince everyone around him that Jin Kirihara is an extraordinary man of great ability. That is the minimum requirement.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"......Why are you being so stubborn?" Kate continued with a sigh. "It's better not to go against that girl."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Why are you so meddlesome? It doesn't suit your looks. Are you trying to appear like a gap moe?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"You act like you can handle it, but do you really think you can win?"</span></span></p>

No matter how powerful her psychic abilities may be, they will be of no use on the battlefield.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"A mere fifteen-year-old, why are you talking like a veteran soldier?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"I see. It's our first meeting, so you don't know me. Actually, I used to be a soldier in a frontier country a long time ago.

Is it true, Jin-kun?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess I haven't told you. It's true that my past is too heavy to tell, that's why I've been hiding it from you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Stop making up stories like that and come over here for a second."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Kate stared at Jin, who was trying to dodge, with a look of dismay on her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"If you knew how scary she really is, you wouldn't be able to look so nonchalant about it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">Jin couldn't think of any particular reason to refuse, so he decided to follow Kate for the time being. They left the clamorous classroom and walked down the long corridor to the courtyard.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">It seemed that Kate was looking for a less populace place. Jin wondered if leaving Emma in the classroom was also because she had something to talk about that she didn't want to be overheard.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">As they weaved their way through the students hanging out in the courtyard, Jin asked as quietly as possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"Are you acquainted with Nina Stingray?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal9"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre28"><span class="calibre7">"I don't really acquainted with her that well.

<p class="msonormal9"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre29">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre29"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Haa?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She
desperately suppressed her urge to scream out.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Right now, she
didn't have any other choice but to respond calmly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You
better go get your eyesight checked. Take a good look. The color of my hair and
eyes......, and even my voice is totally different."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Indeed",
Jin interrupted. " Your looks, your voice, everything is different. Even
with you in front of me, I still can't believe that you and Nina Stingray are
the same person."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Listen
here, do you even understand what I'm talking about?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I know,
no matter how I look at it, I can't bring myself to believe you're the same
person at all."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If
that's what you think, then that's what it is. Is your head screwed or
something?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There would be
no way he could ever imagine she and Nina Stingray were the same person.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The common
citizen is probably not familiar with the existence of wigs and colored contact
lenses that are so elaborate. For that matter, something of such high quality
must still be used only in limited parts of the theatrical world. And even her
voice was chosen from a teenage girl's pitch, the one that is most distant from
the image of Nina Stingray.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course,
it's not just the voice. She had thoroughly crafted the pronunciation of each
word, the timing of each breath, the way she walked, and even the smallest of
gestures.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she
examined the factors that contributed to her mistakes one by one, she noticed
something strange.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, this is
more like an anomaly. This is not a level that can be put away with such vague
words as "strange".</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Then, at that moment, her hands were handcuffed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"When did
you......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
never seen anyone impersonate another person with such precision. It's all so
seamless at that"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina could
only squeeze out a helpless question.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............How
did you know?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A smile like
that of a miner who has struck gold appeared on Jin's lips.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I have
to admit, I was skeptical until the moment you just admitted it yourself."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ha?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
why I really can't believe that the person I see in front of me is Nina
Stingray. I've seen a lot of people doing similar things, but you're on a
completely different level compared to those guys."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No way,
you were just baiting me......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No,
actually, there were a number of unnatural things."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin continued
calmly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"First of
all. I know I say this myself, but not many girls talk to me out of kindness.
Emma is an exception, obviously, so I figured anyone who would try to help me at
a school like this would have some kind of motive."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But
there's a possibility that she's really sincere, right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Unfortunately,
I don't have the kind of life where I can easily trust people. And secondly.
Your disguise was certainly perfect, but I saw signs of a deceitful person in
everything you did and said."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Signs,
huh......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You were
biting your lip and pursing your mouth a lot while you were talking. That's a
sign of dry mouth due to stress. If that's all it was, then maybe you were just
nervous because you were talking to someone you had just met, but even so, the
depth of your breathing and the frequency of your blinking were remarkably
consistent. That was unnatural. I could only assume that you were controlling
it by acting."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's points
did not end there.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What was
most crucial was the fact that you never once tried to look downward while we
were conversing."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's
expression rapidly froze.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"When I
argued with Nina in front of the fountain, I lied to her, saying something
along the lines of [people who are hiding things tend to look downward a lot].
It was just a random made-up line to drive Nina away at that time. So why were
you so careful not to look downward? How could Kate have known about the false
information that only Nina Stingray was supposed to have heard?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After looking
with satisfaction at Nina's inability to say anything back, Jin continued.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then
there's the third reason."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No way,
there's more?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I mean,
this is the biggest reason. There shouldn't be any girls like you in my grade.
There is one girl in class three named Kate, but she's a bit smaller and I
believe she wears glasses."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Don't tell me, you remembered every face and name in our grade?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of
course."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin said it
casually, as if it were a matter of course.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was at a
loss for words.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was only
one day after the entrance ceremony, and while the other students were still
getting used to the school's system and even getting excited about last night's
welcome party, this boy was the only one who was moving ahead of the rest of
them.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">But why does he have
to go to such lengths?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before she
could utter this new question, Jin brought his face close to hers.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So, can
we go back to my first question? What is your purpose?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina forced
her frozen head to move, searching for a way out.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How many cards
do I still have left to play?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Shall I try
using the act I pulled yesterday when I drove the three boys away?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......A~a,
enough with the unnecessary resistance. I already know you're not the monster
everyone says you are."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"W-What
are you talking about......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well,
the moment you change your appearance and approach me, it's as if you're
proving it yourself. Besides, if you have a powerful psychokinetic ability, you
can just break the handcuffs off."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
because I can only use it under special conditions......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You know
what, I'll tell you one thing."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's black
eyes grew stagnant and devoid of any light.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You
better not be thinking of trying to outwit me in a game of deception."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina
understood that the game was now over.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was no
chance of a comeback. It was all over.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Your
psychic ability is probably only a slight alteration of your appearance or your
voice. Also, there is a limitation that you can't change anything of a great
magnitude, such as your skeletal structure or your gender. ...... Well, if you
ask me, it's a lot more useful than having uncontrollable psychokinesis."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Currently,
most of Jin's words barely sunk into Nina's mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was not
like she was being overwhelmed with despair. Despite the situation, Nina was
filled with a strange sense of fulfillment.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A~, I see. I've been
waiting for this moment for so long.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As the
youngest child of the Stingray family, Nina had been playing the role of a
monster all her life. The exhaustion and guilt piled up. She could no longer
bear to hold on to her secrets alone any longer.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unable to hold
back her emotional breakdown, the truth began to overflow from Nina's mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......All
right, I'll tell you the truth. I am not a psychic."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............
Haa~?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's
expression was tinged with shock.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As expected,
he probably never suspected that she being a psychic itself was a lie.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm not
altering my appearance. This is just a disguise."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In front of
Jin's eyes, she removed her wig and colored contacts. Her neatly braided
platinum-colored hair and azure eyes match the features of Nina Stingray,
although her impression differed considerably due to her skillful makeup.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No way,
what kind of disguise technique is that? You really turned into a different
person......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even after
revealing the truth, Jin's surprise did not seem to subside.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then the
change in your voice isn't due to psychic abilities either?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yes,
that's just my talent. I can use about 16 different kinds of voices. Would you
like to hear them?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin laughed in
amazement when Nina said that in a thick, male voice.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The disguise
is something Nina has done only a few times before, and even then only for fun.
And yet, she had managed to deceive even Jin, who had such extraordinary
insight. Nina laughed self-deprecatingly, saying that this was a talent that
the daughter of the Stingray family did not need at all.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With her
refreshed feeling, she began her monologue.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It was
all an act. I've been deceiving the adults by pretending to be an unstable
monster. I didn't know how I would be treated if my family were to find out
that I wasn't a psychic."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I have
never imagined that I could deceive my family for so many years just by
acting......."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Those people
have no interest in me, you know. They just listened to the reports from the
butler and never once looked at me personally. That's why they never found out
about my lies."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her life has
been filled with unbearable loneliness.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was not
allowed to make friends, carried a secret that she could not confide to anyone,
and lived her life while desperately fighting the fear of losing everything.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It sounds
ironic that she was able to keep her secrets hidden because she was always
alone.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I feel
strangely refreshed now. You can inform the instructors, spread rumors among
the students, whatever you like."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What
the, you're surprisingly calm about it, huh? Are you turning into a
deviant?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I
guess so. I've always wanted to destroy this shitty life of mine."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A curtain of
silence descended over the rain-drenched courtyard.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even the sound
of the rain was absorbed by something invisible, and the world was filled with
perfect silence.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Next to her,
with his back against the wall, Jin closed his eyes and thought about
something.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No matter how
cruel the proposal came out of his mouth, she would be able to accept it now.
Nina was strangely certain.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Basically",
Jin finally opened his mouth. "the government-run psychics training school
has two ordinary people mixed up in it."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Two
people? What do you mean?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm just
like you. I'm not a heretic either."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............Eh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm just
an ordinary guy who's good at lying. I just kept deceiving everyone around me,
and before I knew it, I ended up here."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But
that's strange. How did you pass the entrance exam?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"By lying
and cheating."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina could not
quite read through the expression on Jin's face at that moment.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Relief,
malice, pity, hatred, conflict, liberation - so many different emotions were
contained within it that it was impossible to describe in one word.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She didn't
know why she felt that way. But she could clearly feel the intensity of what he
was hiding and what he was carrying on his back.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After a while,
Jin muttered something as if he had made up his mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Hey.
You don't really want to be expelled from this school, do you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well,
yes, but ...... I've already given up on that."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, Jin
started walking forward.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since that part
was no longer covered by the eaves, large drops of rain were drenching him
mercilessly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The landscape
turning white. In the midst of this, Jin turned to her with a fearless
expression on his face.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No
matter what, I don't think I can keep deceiving the whole school by myself. A
big job requires a strong team of people who can handle it. That was part of my
plan from the beginning. Well, I had planned to recruit someone who was
exempted from the entrance exam much later, but ...... this is just perfect."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was playing
with the handcuffs with his left hand while smiling wickedly. Nina had
apparently been released from her restraints without realizing it. The removal
of the handcuffs was probably his way of showing his intentions.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This was not a
threat based on weakness, but a deal of equals.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Am I
being recruited, by any chance?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm glad
you're so perceptive. As expected of an honor student."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Does
that mean ...... we are going to work together to survive?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"[Surviving]
is just a secondary goal."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Isn't it
obvious? You and I will aim for the top of the school."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At Heiberg
Academy, it is said that only about a dozen students each year make it to
graduation.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It would be
reckless for mere liars with no psychic abilities to challenge such a tough
competition for survival. And to aim for the top is nothing but a foolish
delusion.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
That's, impossible."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh?
Because we are just normal human beings, you know? There's no way we can defeat
students around us, let alone those who were exempted from entrance exam."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why are
you being so pessimistic."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even under
such bad weather, Jin's eyes never showed any signs of cloudiness.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In fact, his
eyes were calm and confident about his success.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You've
been able to deceive the Stingray family for a long time, haven't you? There's
no way that a great actor who can fool even the members of the &lt;White
Knights&gt; is going to fall behind a mere student."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Even so,
that's just......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'll
write the script."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin extended
his right hand while his whole body was exposed to the cold rain. The
expression on his face is neither acting nor conceited but is backed by a firm
confidence.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
already laid out a plan, all the way toward our final goal. If you cooperate
with me, it will be much less difficult to execute. All I need is for you to
play the role of an actor in the script. Now, let me ask you once again ......
what are you worried about?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well,
there's only one thing that bothers me ....... I don't trust you yet."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Is trust
really necessary?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......What
do you mean?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"First of
all, we're both aware of each other's weaknesses. If either one of us snitches
on the other, there's zero risk of betrayal as long as we're on the same side.
And for the same reason, you don't have the option to say no in the first
place."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ugh.......
That's true, but..."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"And
another reason. We are essentially similar."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Similar.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Was it because
similar thoughts were floating around in Nina's mind that she could not deny
the word immediately? Or was it because she had decided to accept whatever fate
befell her?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You and
I both have screwed-up personalities who just enjoy deceiving people. You know
what I mean, don't you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ha~, I
didn't enjoy it at all......!</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh? You
don't even realize it? Oh, well, whatever."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the pouring
rain, the fraudster's mouth twisted into a vicious grin.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Just
imagine. What would happen if my deception were combined with your acting? With
two first-rate fraudsters, you and I together could fool even the world."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before Jin
could finish, the rain began to slow down and a ray of light fell through a gap
in the clouds.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was too good to be true. It's as if fate has been
conspiring against me.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps. If Jin, who possesses genius deception
skills, and I, who can perfectly act out his script, could team up, then
maybe....</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Perhaps, we might
really be able to fool even the world.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina noticed
that a smile was forming at the corners of her mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Can I
take that expression as a sign of approval?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She could not
deny that a sense of elation was rising from within her body. Only a few
minutes ago, she had even prepared herself to lose everything.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......A~,
gosh! All right, all right!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina stepped
out into the rain-soaked world and grasped back the right hand offered to her.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'll
ride your ambition. Let's deceive the world together."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Now there was
no turning back.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although Nina
approved, she still couldn't help but feel a little anxious.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If I were to be a deviant, I should choose the one
that has the best chance of leading to a little bit of hope. It is far more
salvageable than giving up everything and waiting for my ends.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Accepting the
girl's resolve, Jin Kirihara muttered in the white light.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Good,
now we are accomplices."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆　</span></p>


<p><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">On the day of the
&lt;duel&gt;</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On that day, a
tense atmosphere filled the entire classroom building from the morning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Not only was
this the first time the &lt;Duel&gt; system was to be practiced among the first
graders, but the combination of the two competitors was also arousing the
curiosity of the students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina Stingray,
who grew up in a famous family that has produced a number of renowned
individuals with psychic abilities and is known as the &lt;Queen of
Disaster&gt;, will be facing an ordinary, unknown student who did not perform
well on the entrance exam and was forced to take part in the &lt;screening
test&gt;. Many of the students who came to watch the duel held a faint
expectation of seeing a show in which the cocky, and weak ones would be
thoroughly trampled upon.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Finally, the
chime for the end of the school day rang, and the two left the classroom
together.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since the
&lt;duel&gt; would be held in a forested area a short distance from the
classroom building, the students had to watch the match from a small balcony
with a few binoculars. This was because Nina had warned them that they might
get involved if they were too close.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the
balcony, filled with curiosity and excitement, Emma Licorice was the only one
who was feeling a different kind of emotion than the other students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had no
idea why the two ended up in a rift.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But was it
really inevitable?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She couldn't
believe that in less than an hour, one of them would have to leave the
academy......</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"They
sure do some interesting things, don't they?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A sudden voice
made Emma turn around to see a tall, handsome boy smiling at her. His black
hair was parted in the middle and he looked very mature, and one could sense
the elegance in his every gesture.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Like Nina, he
is a student who was exempted from the entrance exam. His name is </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~,
excuse my hasty conversation. My name is Bennett Lohr. I heard that my friend
Nina was involved in some trouble, so I just wanted to check on her."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was a
tacit agreement that the location of the &lt;Duel&gt; would not be disclosed to
anyone outside of the class. That said, Bennett belongs to the fifth class.
Given that he was from the neighboring class, it would not be surprising if
information was already leaked to the others as well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett
introduced himself first, and gave a perfect smile that seemed to be straight
out of the first page of a textbook.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nice to
meet you, Emma...... But to think there really is a daredevil out there who would
challenge Nina to a duel. Is he perhaps really thinking he can win?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hmmm......
I wonder."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennet's tone
was laced with dismay, and Emma couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Seriously, why
did Jin challenge her to a duel?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He seemed to
be a more rational and cautious type of person during the &lt;screening
test&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oi, here
they come!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">One of the
boys cried out, and everyone on the balcony gasped in unison. Emma, whose turn
to use the binoculars had not yet come, could only see them as peas moving in the
forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's
going on? Both of them, just standing still while facing each other......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A female
student, who took her turn to look through the binoculars, raised a doubtful
voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Based on the
newly thrown questions, the students spontaneously started discussing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are they
gauging each other out?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nina's
&lt;Queen of Calamity&gt; should be able to destroy him without a second
thought. There should be no reason for her to be so cautious."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nevertheless,
that guy named Jin is also a very mysterious person......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, no.
He's nothing but someone who was subjected to the &lt;screening test&gt;, you
know?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But at
that time, he was earning points by defeating a well-known opponent,
right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A brawl
between dropouts isn't worth much...... I think."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Aside from
Nina, whose abilities were well known even before she enrolled, there was
extremely little information on Jin, whose relationships with his classmates,
with the exception of Emma, were tenuous. Most of them probably think that the
outcome is so obvious that it is not even worth a bet.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Come to think of it, where is that girl?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The girl I befriended yesterday, who calls herself
Kate, is nowhere to be seen. We had been taking classes together all day, but
she went back to her dormitory without showing any interest in this big event.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's
wrong ...... Emma?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma returned
a vague smile to Bennett, who looked into her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She has a
feeling that something beyond their imagination might be going on.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Whether it was
merely foreboding or meant something else, Emma wasn't sure.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As if to blow
her doubts, an explosion sounded.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No one could
take their eyes off the full-scale battle that had finally begun.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Explosions
echoed intermittently, and white smoke began to rise throughout the wooded
area. Yet the two remained motionless while facing each other.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I bet
it's their psychic powers clashing ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-It's
safe here, ...... right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Look,
Nina removed her brooch! That's the signal to unleash her powers!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I had never heard of such a phenomenon of invisible powers
colliding with each other among people with psychic abilities, but maybe it is
common knowledge that I just don't know about.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before Emma
could put her doubts into words, the students quickly evacuated into the
classroom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Only Bennett,
with an incomprehensible smile on his face, was staring at the figures facing
each other in the wooded area.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the wooded
area, filled with white smoke and the smell of gunpowder, Nina and Jin were
facing each other.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As instructed,
she removed the brooch from her chest, and for some reason, Jin kneeled on the
ground and began to let out a cry of anguish. When she held out her right hand
toward Jin, he began to scream, even breaking out in a sweat.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His acting was
a little too exaggerated, and there were many rough edges. But even this should
be sufficient for the students, who can only see him from afar through
binoculars.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Naturally,
they were not aware of the fact that the two had not signed any written pledge,
nor that it was just an ordinary tin doll on the ground, not Jake, who was
present to witness the duel.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Look,
the class is fleeing into the classroom"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I guess
...... it went well."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Looks
like the rumors you spread are working. As expected of a great fraudster."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't
want to be told by you ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The plan was
going well, but it was still too early to relax.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At least for
another three minutes or so, they have to continue acting out the fight to the
death according to the script.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To divert her
attention from her body, which was reaching its limits due to anxiety, fatigue,
and lack of sleep, Nina decided to think back to last night's details.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Sixteen hours before
the &lt;Duel&gt;</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When they
parted ways in the courtyard, Jin told her, "I want you to come to the
wooded area where the [duel] will take place at 1:00 a.m.".</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since she was
good at hiding her presence, sneaking out of the dormitory in the middle of the
night was an easy task. Nina carefully made her way along the path at night,
trying not to get her feet caught in the muddy ground after the rain had
stopped.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There were no
streetlights near the wooded area, and it was forbidden to bring a flashlight.
All she could rely on was the light of the moon in the night sky.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It felt
strange to walk outside in her silk nightgown, and she was a little nervous
about meeting a male student alone in the middle of the night, especially
considering the fact that the other party was an incomprehensible fraudster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once she
arrived at her destination, Nina was taken aback.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Let's
see ....... Huh? What does this mean?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her eyes,
which had grown accustomed to the darkness, caught sight of four men silently
going about some sort of work.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Almost all of
them were adults, dressed in dark-colored work clothes and expertly blending
into the darkness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They were
digging in the ground or setting up some kind of device on a tree trunk, the
purpose of which she had no idea.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After a
momentary loss of words, one of the four stopped working and approached her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why are
you in your pajamas? You can't work wearing that."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The man who
looked the youngest was actually Jin Kirihara, dressed in his work clothes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His bangs,
which normally hung down, were pulled up and tucked into a towel wrapped around
his forehead.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a
troubled expression on his face, Jin offered a shovel to Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Look,
don't just stand there, we got some work to do. For now, can you dig a hole in
the arranged spot for me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hold on
a second, I really don't get it! Why are we doing civil engineering work this
late at night? And since when did I get sold off to a contractor?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're
overthinking things ....... All you have to do is just dig a hole and fill it
with gunpowder."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"G-Gunpowder!?
No way, are you trying to make me participate in terrorism ......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Calm
down, it's not like we're going to kill someone. It's just a toy that makes a
lot of noise and smoke."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're
trying to catch me off guard and frame me as the main culprit, right!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Am I that untrustworthy?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"On the
contrary, I wish you would tell me how I can trust you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina threw her
next question with a sigh.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Besides, who are these people?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"They're
the &lt;landscape contractors&gt; I've been using for a long time. They are
expensive, but they do a good job even if hired at a moment's notice. That
scary-looking old man is Gasta-san, their president."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... I
can't keep up with the tsukkomi any longer. Using them for a long time, you
say? Weren't you supposed to be a student?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh,
didn't I tell you? I've never been to school, you know?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haa?
Don't keep throwing in new facts that don't make any sense one after
another."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
been wandering around the country helping an old fraudster with his
business."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Another
stupid lie......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's
true, it's true. I've probably made about 300 million els so far."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't
make up stories like that. I mean, what does that have to do with these
people?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Heiberg
Academy maintains a level of secrecy to the extent that students who leave the
school are subjected to memory-sealing measures. Naturally, the security system
is not so lax that a suspicious contractor can break in with ease. There is
only one entrance, which is guarded by a gatekeeper, and there is even barbed
wire attached to the fence surrounding the property.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
because Gasta-san and the others are professionals."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That
doesn't explain anything......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"They
have broken into a prison on an isolated island before. That's why, they can
break through this level of security easily."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hey,
what are you going to do with these criminals? I really want to go back."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Whatever,
by the way, your personality sure is different from when you're in the

agape, Jin began to talk about his plan to get over their predicament.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was a
strategy that, upon hearing the outline, seemed like child's play.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They implanted
a device that generates explosions and smoke in the forest, and made onlookers
believe that it was caused by Nina's ability. With the assumption that no one
would be allowed to approach them for any reason, they would be able to avoid
any major problems.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course,
that alone would not be enough.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The

than the surrounding darkness stared intently at Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Tomorrow,
I want you to spend the day pretending to be that Kate or whatever she's called
and spread rumors all over the class. I want you to tell the class that when

your abilities, and so on......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh~? Is
it safe to spread such blatant lies?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't
care about the content or whether it's true or not. Anyway, what's important is
to create the fact that we two are the kind of existence that is talked about
through groundless rumors."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What do
you mean? Just what in the world is the point to doing that?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If you
circulate a lot of meaningful rumors, the information will be rearranged on its
own and will spread rapidly. That way, when there is an explosion among us, for
example, someone will come up with a plausible theory."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's
that? It's almost like incitement! You really are a scoundrel, aren't
you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What,

moon wasn't hiding behind a cloud, the boy's face in front of her suddenly
disappeared from her vision. Her two eyes caught visual images without any
problem, but her brain couldn't process what kind of expression was on his
face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Come to think of
it, Nina barely knew anything about Jin's past.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What kind of a
life would have created such a monster?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well,
you can stop here. It would look suspicious if your pajamas were stained. You

here, even I have a name you know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I know
that. Every dog in the neighborhood has a name. Even tin dolls have
names."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You can
call me Nina."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ha?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"As I

you keep calling me [you], I'll get angry."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I
understand, Nina. Is that okay?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Somehow,
the way you say it is kind of awkward. Huh, are you perhaps embarrassed to see
a girl in pajamas?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina closed
the distance between herself and Jin while saying in a seductive voice. It was
a well-done act, even for herself. With this acting, she could easily be
compared to a top-class stage actress playing a high-quality romance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She wanted to
see Jin, who was so full of confidence flinch like a boy of his age.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If she could
see him in such a cute and adorable state, she would be able to sleep soundly
tonight with a sense of superiority.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, Jin's
reaction was far more relaxed than she had expected.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Aren't you a little too close? Don't tell me, you're trying to seduce me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"H-Haaaaaah!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was an
unpredictable counter.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The temperature
on her face rose rapidly due to her frustration and embarrassment that her plan
had been foiled.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Aren't
you a little too cocky!? What a creepy guy, don't talk to me anymore!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I have a
feeling you brought this on yourself, though ...... What's going on here?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Enough!
I'm going back!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait,
wait, what's wrong with your emotional stability?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina glared at
Jin, who replied with the same unabashed bravado as ever.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Not good, talking and acting won't work against Jin.
It's best to give up on the easy way of seizing the lead by swaying him with
romantic acts as soon as possible.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'll
definitely bring you to your knees someday!". Nina said like a villain and
decided to go home.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin Kirihara
is an untrustworthy fraudster, She thought.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But as an accomplice,
there is certainly no one more reassuring than him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even though
she was so close to him, she did not know how far ahead he was planning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even after the
&lt;Duel&gt; was over, the classroom was still enveloped in a strange silence.
Everyone seemed afraid to utter a word. Only the occasional coughing could be
heard.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Toward the end
of the day, everyone in the class had evacuated to their classrooms, and the
lingering smoke made it difficult to see what was going on in the wooded area.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was Jin who
was the first to kneel down, and from the previous reputation, it was obvious
who was the winner. Still, many students showed respect for Jin, who had a
decent fight with the notorious monster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma,
bewildered as she was dragged along by the atmosphere around her, caught sight
of a girl entering the classroom through the door behind her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Nina. Are you okay?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time
she regretted calling out to her, everyone in the classroom had turned their
attention to Nina, who had just returned from the &lt;Duel&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Not caring
about their attention, she opened her mouth with her usual graceful manner.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of
course, I would never be defeated by him."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......What
about Jin-kun? Don't tell me, is he expelled from school?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's mouth
curled into a smile as she spoke hesitantly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I
changed my mind. I decided not to take any points from him this time."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">According to
the information that came out at the party the other day, the winner of the
&lt;Duel&gt; can also choose whether or not to fulfill the agreement in the
written pledge. If the winner were to change their mind, it could invalidate
the transfer of the points they had originally wagered.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Does
that mean you acknowledge his ability?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly,
Bennett interrupted them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina showed
slight surprise at his appearance, but quickly regained her composure. Looking
around at the awe-struck class, she muttered in an amused voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".....You
may interpret it that way. At the very least, I thought it would be unfair to
have him expelled from the academy after only two days."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hee.......
So he's on a level that someone with psychic abilities like you would
recognize, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina thought
about something for a moment and then said with a mischievous expression on her
face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Perhaps
he might be able to sweep you off your feet as well."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal7"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett
laughed, as though he had just heard a great joke.</span></span></p>
