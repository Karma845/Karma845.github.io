<h3>Chapter 6: Citrus Magic, Sequins, and the Glitter of Counterfeit Coins</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Three days had passed
since an unexpected situation arose in &lt;Chase Tag&gt;.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin won eight points
by skillfully manipulating his opponent's mind. It seemed to be a rather modest
victory, and Jin, who was standing in front of the deserted fountain, did not
seem to be in a state of agitation as he talked about his next plans.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The
&lt;Practical Exam&gt; is held every other week, and the content changes each
month. So, next time, we have to do the &lt;Chase Tag&gt; again, where there is
no room for trickery. Well, since you can pick your opponent, I guess you have
plenty of leeway."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"As I told you
earlier, Bennett has his eye fixed on you. How are you going to fight against
such a monster?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, are you that
worried?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Gosh, it's
nothing like that! You're still as relaxed as ever......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But it sure is a
little embarrassing having a beautiful woman like you worried about me."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"H-Haa!? What are
you saying all of a sudden!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Heh, you look so
cute even when you're mad. Have you changed your makeup recently?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, stop it! I
don't have any tolerance for that kind of thing!</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Well,
let's put the silly jokes aside and get back to the main topic."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haaaa!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She couldn't help but
feel so pathetic that she blushed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Seeing Nina, who was
about to cry in anger, Jin muttered something to himself mixed with sighs.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't worry, I
was planning to clash against Bennett at some point. It's just that my plan has
been accelerated a little bit. I had already devised a plan to trap him before
he even enrolled."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Before he
enrolled? ...... You're bluffing again, aren't you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't you dare
underestimate my preparations. It's essential to take measures for those who
are exempted from the entrance exam."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Eh, don't
tell me, are you planning to fight against the other four as well?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"In the
worst-case scenario, yes. Well, I'd like to limit it to two or three."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's that, a
prophecy? It's kind of shady."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm just making
a plan based on a number of predictions. You're making it sound like it's
someone else's problem, but Nina, you're part of the plan as well, you
know."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ugh, that's
true......."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In contrast to Nina,
who was almost trembling with fear, Jin was smiling fearlessly. As though there
is nothing in the world worth fearing.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What kind of life does
one have to lead to become such a crazed gambler?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How did Jin acquire
such advanced skills of deception?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Why did he choose to
end up in a place like this?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Anxious about the
struggle for survival and Bennett's offers... Nina is conflicted between
various issues, but she cannot advance unless she uncovers what Jin is hiding
from her.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, tomorrow
is a holiday, so you can get some rest. Don't let your fatigue build up and
render your acting sloppy."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin, I hope you
don't think of me like I'm one of your subordinates."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina clenched her
fists while her mouth was pouting.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This is an
opportunity. It's now or never to put that plan into action.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Do you have any
plans for tomorrow, Jin?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Aa, nothing in
particular. What about you, Nina?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm thinking of
going into town to do some shopping. Disguise stuff, you know, that sort of
thing."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hmm. I don't
really familiar with that, so I'll leave it to you."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............No,
that's not what I meant."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Do I have to tell him myself?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As soon as she became
aware of this, she felt a heat rising in the depths of her body.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She hates to be
misunderstood, but this is also to uncover Jin's secret.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You see,
umm...... let's go together."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"L-Look! There
might be some heavy luggage! You're my accomplice, so you could at least help
me with that, right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eeh~ ...... what
a hassle."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-Isn't it fine
just for this once? You don't have anything to do anyway."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why do you want
me to come so badly? Well, I guess it can't be helped then."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Y-You're being
too self-conscious, you know!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Alright,
alright. You're at an age when you can't be honest."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"H-Haaaaaaaaa!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No more. The more I
talk, the more likely I will be exposed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina shifted her mind
and decided to think only about how to interrogate him.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although it had been
more than two weeks since she had been here, Nina had never ventured outside
the school grounds. And due to family circumstances, she had never used public
transportation other than the steam train. Slightly nervous, she sat on a bench
at the bus stop and waited.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">What should I do if I'm misunderstood in a strange
way.......</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's head was filled
with embarrassment and anxiety.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She asked him out on
the spur of the moment, but would this qualify as a [date]? The truth is, this
is a plan to uncover Jin's secret, but there is no way of telling him that.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In any case, any
careless remark would be fatal to Jin, who has a twisted nature. If he thought
she had a crush on him, she would never know what he might do to her. That man
is a fiend.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she waited,
clutching the strap of her bag, she finally saw Jin just as the bus was about
to depart.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Gosh, you're
late. Even though it's not that early."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't worry. The
local buses are never on time."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His calm and somewhat
optimistic attitude was typical of him. Although it hadn't been that long since
she met him, she began to understand Jin's personality a little better.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin mumbled, not
bothering to hide his yawn.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But it's a
little surprising. I can't believe you asked me out on a date."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm not! Don't
make things up!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But you
see..."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Y-You were so
insistent on asking me out, so I just took you up on your offer!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nina-san, I
think your defense is a little too desperate."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-I feel sorry
for you, so I'll go out with you. It's just for today, you hear me?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Alright,
alright, that's enough."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As they climbed into
the bus, which arrived 10 minutes late, Jin smiled at her wryly.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Besides, I know
you wanted me to come here for a reason. Am I right? I totally get it."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">If you say it like that in your usual work mode, that
would piss me off.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina followed suit,
shaking off the thought that suddenly popped into her head.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As soon as they
entered the bus, Jin did not hesitate to take a seat in the last row. Come to
think of it, he always sat in the back row even in the classroom.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When she asked why,
Jin looked out the window and muttered.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Because I can
see everything better when I'm in the back."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"This is the first
time I've ever heard someone say that observing people is a hobby."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, it's kind
of an occupational hazard, after all."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The conversation was
cut off there, but the words [occupational hazard] did not escape her ears.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Every time she asked
him about his past, she would be misled by some random topic, but it was
certainly hard to believe that he had led a normal life as an ordinary student.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Perhaps he really is</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you two
going on a date to the town down at the foothills?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Eh~ah~!?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina almost jumped
when the elderly woman sitting in front of her suddenly spoke to her.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"N-No, we don't
have that kind of a relationship."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"We are siblings
who have been separated by birth", Jin said, helping her out. "We
were reunited by chance at the Academy for Psychic......."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ara~, I didn't
know such a miracle existed."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"We're surprised
ourselves."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina had never seen
such a suspicious smile before in her life.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"We are on our
way to see our parents, arguing over who was born first."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina couldn't help but
be amazed at Jin, who lied as if he was breathing, but the woman who was being
deceived nodded her head in satisfaction. At this, Nina had no choice but to
smile and nod.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After getting off at a
bus stop in the center of town, she decided to point it out.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Do you always
tell such meaningless lies? It's okay though, because it didn't harm
anyone."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It was you who
improvised and added that perfect touch, though. You did a great job of
conveying the feeling of looking forward to seeing our parents again."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, that was a
reflex ......."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, we're both
severely screwed, aren't we?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They couldn't help but
laugh in dismay at themselves as their lies were ingrained in the very core of
their bodies.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The main street of the
town of Akkas is lined with stalls displaying foodstuffs, clothing, and other
items.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was one stall
that displayed vegetables two times larger than the others. Following the sign
with their eyes, it seemed that the products were procured from a person with a
psychic ability to accelerate the growth of plants. Across the street was a
repairman, advertising that he could make even the most broken pots and pans
look as good as new with the help of a psychic he knew.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This was a sight Nina
had never seen before.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So Psychics are
even involved in these stalls, huh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If you take a
look outside the Heiberg School, there are plenty of psychics who can be put to
good use in industry. Haven't you ever heard the saying, [If there is even one
psychic in the family, there is no way the family will go hungry]?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hee. It's a
great learning experience to see this kind of thing in person."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's all well
and good to be impressed, but don't we have to go shopping for disguise
stuff?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Ah, that
reminds me..."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"See, I knew it,
you invited me was just an excuse."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"N-N-No, you're
wrong! It wasn't because I wanted to go on a date or anything of the
sort......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nina, where did
your genius acting skills go?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ugh......"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her initial plan was
to make it a fun date to make Jin drop his guard and tell her his secret.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Yet, here she is.
Because she is not immune to this kind of thing, she feels embarrassed to play
her role. It was at this moment that she realized her fatal weakness.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She shouldn't have
done anything that didn't suit her.</span></span></p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/bw6.jpg">

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She should just behave
as usual, as a mere accomplice.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-I've had
enough of those disguise things! Let's just stroll around the city."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No matter how I
look at you, you seem to be nervous. I know you're up to something."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Stop making
false accusations. Come on, let's go!"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina hastily ended the
conversation and started walking towards the crowd.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The crowds on the
boulevard were denser than she had imagined and too challenging for Nina, who
had always been inside the mansion. She bumped shoulders with someone several
times as she followed Jin's back, who was moving ahead at a brisk pace.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Be careful,
there is definitely a pickpocket hiding somewhere. Hold your bag with both
hands."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin periodically
turned his head back to check on her, while grinning like a fool. It was the
very first time she learned that he could be so considerate.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Then, why didn't he just walk next to me like a normal
person?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she was getting
angry at herself for thinking this, Jin asked her while looking behind him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Speaking of which,
Nina, when did you realize that you have a talent for acting?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was a little taken
aback, as it was the first time she had ever been asked such a question.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Let's see, when
I was six years old, I guess."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hee. That's
quite early."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I think it was
around the time when my butler took me to see a play."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I thought
butlers were imaginary creatures."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, we weren't
that close", she continued with a wry smile. "I still remember the
play very well. The play was about a one-night adventure of a princess who was
bound to the royal palace. I can vividly recall every line of dialogue and
every change in the actors' facial expressions. It was such a thrilling
experience."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So you went home
and started practicing your acting?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yeah. I was
often taken to social gatherings, where I practiced my acting skills. That's
when I thought maybe I had the talent."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I see. So you
were trained in actual combat."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before seeing that
play, the social world was nothing but a painful place for her. She had been
suffocating with guilt over being forced to be part of a farce by adults who
lied through their facial expressions and speeches.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But now she knew.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She knew that an
overwhelming acting by itself could move people.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haven't you ever
thought about pursuing it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Pursue what?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Quit your
role-playing as a heretic and become an actual actor."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"An actor,
huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I hear the movie
business is booming right now. I think the market is going to get bigger and
bigger."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......If I were
born in a normal family, I might consider such an option."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For some reason, she
was in the mood to speak her mind for once.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But the
Stingrays has no place for anyone other than psychics. They are the kind of
family that adopts potential children from all over the country and banishes
them as soon as they don't seem to be budding, you know? Besides, I'm the
youngest, and I'm a woman. If they were to find out I don't have any psychic
abilities, who knows what kind of place they'll sell me to ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... I've
heard a lot of rumors about it. I never thought they were true though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A long time ago,
when I was about eight years old, I had a sister who was a little older than
me. She, too, was expected to be blessed with a psychic ability, and it seems
she was adopted from a town far away. We were really close. We were like real
sisters......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's she up to
now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I don't
know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you two
growing apart or something?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No. Before she
turned 12 years old, she suddenly disappeared from the mansion. Since then, no
one has talked about her anymore. It was as if she had never existed in the
family in the first place."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you saying
that she was banished?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The only thing I
knew was that she actually wasn't a psychic. When the Stingrays found out, they
discarded her as easily as trimming an unwanted branch. Even though she was
only twelve years old......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What was most
frightening was the reaction of her father, her brothers, and the butler who
was supposed to be closest to her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They looked at the
12-year-old child being thrown out of the mansion as if they were looking at a
piece of filth strewn on the floor.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If they were willing
to recognize and respect the human rights of others, they would never have made
that kind of expression.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That was the first
time in Nina's life that she had ever felt such a chilling fear.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Even so,
she was merely banished, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina couldn't quite
grasp the emotion in Jin's voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What would
happen in your case then?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't know.
Ahaha, maybe they'll kill me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It doesn't sound
like a joke at all......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She couldn't see Jin's
expression as he said this, because the backlight was blocking her view.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, she could
sense the wavering emotions in his words.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Is he perhaps hiding his anger right now?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm getting
hungry. What do you want to eat, Nina?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina decided to join
in on the change of subject, as if she was trying to cover something up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The sun had already
risen above them, and it was the perfect time to have lunch.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They decided to look
for a restaurant, but since neither of them was familiar with the area, they
wandered further and further into the less crowded areas.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Somehow,
the atmosphere around here feels totally different."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unlike the lively main
street, the alleys in this area were deserted.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The shadows of the
buildings make it a little dim, and the faces of the people passing by are
somewhat somber.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, Nina spotted
a parent and child doing business on the street by spreading out straw mats on
the floor.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Various kinds of
vegetables and fruits were lined up on it, but they were all either badly
shaped or a bit small in size. Above all, the child who was trying to attract
customers was so small and thin that she looked no older than six years old.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina had never known
that such a reality existed until now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although she was aware
of it as information, she felt as if it was a distant world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She wondered if she
was going to school properly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina secretly prayed
that he was only helping his &nbsp;mother
because it was a holiday.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Behind the
glorious history of the Empire - the glory of the &lt;White Knights&gt;, there
are many people who were crushed by heretics who strayed to the towns and
cities. They were simply deprived of their jobs or beaten down by unreasonable
violence."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin continued in a
frighteningly cold voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The other party
is, of course, a monster, so no matter how ordinary people are treated, they
have no choice but to weep in silence. Since laws haven't been established yet,
it is difficult to enforce laws against crimes caused by psychic abilities.
Well, I don't know if that child's situation has anything to do with
heretics."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Jin, you
are..."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What kind of
life have you led so far?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Could your
motive for sneaking into the Heiberg Academy be </span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before she could utter
such questions, Jin went to the child who was sitting in front of the straw
mats. He crouched down in front of the boy and spoke to him with a natural
smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Can I have a
lemon, please?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The boy gave Jin the
biggest lemon he could find while smiling. In return, he clutched the coin he
had received like it was more precious than life itself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, who returned with
a lemon, still wore the same emotionless expression, but she could tell that he
was now hiding something in the soft part of his heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah right, let me
show you a little magic trick I used to do."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Magic
trick?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It was a popular
trick until the heretics started showing up. Well, it would be faster if I
showed you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin grabbed the lemon
he had just bought from the boy with his right hand and made a clenched fist
with his other hand as well. Just like that, both of his hands were held out in
front of Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Which do you
think holds the lemon, the right hand or the left hand?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, it's
sticking out of your right hand though......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"This is indeed
too easy ...... Then what about the next one?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin gave a relaxed
smile and stuck out both of his clenched hands once more.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This time, Nina didn't
really know which was the right one.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The lemon should not
fit in the palm of his hand. To begin with, neither hand was bulging, and neither
looked like they were holding anything at all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Having no choice, Nina
pointed to her left hand based on her intuition.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Too bad, you
lost."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Jin opened his
right hand, a fruit the size of a palm protruding from his palm suddenly
appeared.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Where on earth had he
hidden such a thing?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"How did you do
it? You really don't have any psychic abilities, do you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's just a
rudimentary magic trick. I just hide the lemon in my sleeve, in the blind spot
of the audience."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin demonstrated how
he could manipulate the lemon with just his fingertips and lead it to his
sleeve so that Nina could see it. It was as if the lemon itself was moving with
a will of its own, and her surprise was even greater after she learned the
trick.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then, here's the
final one. Which hand is it in this time?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Again, there was no
such thing as a lemon sticking out of both hands.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But Nina had learned
the tricks now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Show me what's
inside your sleeve."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I can't do it
with my hands right now. Roll them up yourself."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She did as she was
told and rolled up the sleeves of the shirt that Jin was wearing. She checked
up to his elbow to be sure, but there was no lemon anywhere to be seen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Give up?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Uu, hold
on!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even after observing
his hands from various angles, she still couldn't find a trace of lemon.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Alright, time's
up."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Where did
you hide it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't you feel
like your bag is getting heavier?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">...... No way.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina timidly opened
her bag and inserted her hand into it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There, something soft
touched her fingertips.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina screamed in
astonishment as she pulled out the lemon from inside the bag.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......No way!
How!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I can't teach
you this trick."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eeh, even if
it's just a hint?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin chuckled in a
troubled manner and muttered quietly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Once you've
planted an assumption in someone's mind, the deception is 90% successful."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hmm? What do you
mean?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin did not answer any
further and started walking again in search of a restaurant.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Then Nina noticed a
crucial fact.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Jin was smiling now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was not the sort of
smile he used to trick someone, nor was it a smile that enjoyed the thrill of
deceiving someone. It was as if he was genuinely enjoying surprising others
with his magic tricks.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was the same kind
of expression her sister, with whom she had lived for only three weeks, had
shown her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She, too, had this
mischievous look on her face when she presented her with a rain frog doll
adorned with sparkling sequins.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Let's make it all clear right here and now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina decided to ask
the question that had been bottled up in her heart for so long.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Jin. Show
me who you really are."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin shrugged his
shoulders as if he had no idea what she was talking about.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina ignored it and
continued.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Which one is
your true self? The one who was fooling everyone at the school or the one who showed
me a magic trick just now? Which one is the real you, Jin?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh, what? Is
there some kind of multiple personality theory going around?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't play dumb
with me. Tell me the truth."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the street, where a
dusty wind was blowing, the two stared at each other for a while.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Now, Jin might be
willing to tell her the truth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Strangely, Nina was
able to think so.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......Let me
change the question. Why did you decide to enroll at Heiberg Academy?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've told you a
million times. I'm aiming to reach the top there......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's your
goal, right? I'm asking about your motives."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She decided to throw
out a guess.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you perhaps
infiltrating the academy for revenge?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, how could
you come to that conclusion?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You seem to
always enjoy deceiving people. But is that really the reason you would walk
such a dangerous tightrope? It doesn't seem like it's about making money
either."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait, wait,
isn't it a little too early to conclude it as revenge?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you sure?
Because, Jin, you hate psychics, don't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin sometimes used the
derogatory term [heretics].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When he talked about
psychics, he would sometimes exude hostility in every word he said.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was not fooling
around with some random made-up story as usual, which proved that maybe what
Nina had said was not off the mark.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After a long, really
long silence, Jin quietly opened his mouth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... It's
better not to ask any further questions", Jin's heavy gaze fixed on her.
"If you want to continue being an accomplice with me that is."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She tried to search
for emotion in the depths of his eyes, but there was only a hollow void.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps sensing that
Nina was still not backing down, Jin muttered with a sigh.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"My real goal is
to destroy the &lt;White Knights&gt;."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina involuntarily
stiffened as the words came from an unexpected direction.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The White Knights.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A special agency under
the direct control of the government and one of the most important forces in
the country. They are the heroes of the nation and the object of admiration of
all the students at Heiberg Academy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And above all, Nina's
two older brothers belong to it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I lost my father
to them."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The memory of the time
she and Jin ran into each other in front of the fountain after escaping from
the party came back to her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">During the exchange of
verbal abuse, Jin hinted at the existence of bad rumors about Nina's family.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina did not know what
the &lt;White Knights&gt; had been doing behind the scenes of their glory. On
the other hand, she also knew that they were not just innocent heroes, but a
powerful and violent organization.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What if the
truth, never told and buried in the darkness, had robbed Jin of something
precious?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As a member of
the Stingray family, am I qualified to stop Jin?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......But how
are you going to do it? They are the heroes of our nation, a group of people
with psychic abilities, one of the best in the country, and there is nothing a
mere commoner can do against them."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Just turn
everything into a farce."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Both eardrums caught
the words, but Nina couldn't quite grasp their meaning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Turn
everything into a farce?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What on earth
was Jin talking about?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Once I graduate
from the school at the top of the class, the &lt;White Knights&gt; will surely
come to recruit me. I'm going to reveal the truth in front of many people at
that time when the whole nation is paying attention to me. I will tell them,
I'm actually not a psychic."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What on earth
are you doing that for......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm sure they'll
be shocked. If Heiberg Academy is such a crappy place that a mere ordinary
person can make it to the top, their authority will be completely shattered.
Both the Heiberg Academy and the &lt;White Knights&gt; would lose the trust of
the people, and fall at once. All at the hands of a single fraudster. ......
Isn't that an insanely amusing turn of events?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But ...... if

able to say it with certainty.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin planned to die
after revealing his identity and turning the whole thing into a farce.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Because his eyes never
focused on the future. His dark eyes have been chasing the past, the past of
his father's death at the hands of a psychic.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if he thought he
was cleverly hiding it, Nina's eyes, which are first-rate liars, cannot be
fooled.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......That's
just a desperate desire for destruction. Jin."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Deep down, Nina felt
hope in her accompliceship with Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She believed, even
though she had no basis for it, that at the end of their walk a tightrope
misdeeds, a future in which they would both be saved was waiting for them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But what lay ahead was
an ending like this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin is certainly not a
good person. He may be nothing more than a hopeless fraudster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But even so, it would
be too sad to live a life that just keeps moving toward his end.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina felt a new
determination grow in the depths of her heart as she gazed at Jin's back who
began striding away as if nothing had happened.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if it meant wasting
his feelings, even if it meant being resented by him, she had to stop him from
walking toward his doom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was convinced.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The only one who could
save him was herself, his accomplice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time they
returned to the bus stop near the Heiberg Academy, it was already dark.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The smile had already
disappeared from Jin's face, replaced by the expression of a liar with wariness
and suspicion stretched across its surface.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina wondered if Jin
himself was aware that there was a sense of sadness on his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Let's part
ways here."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yes. See you
later."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The two parted ways
halfway down the street and headed off to their respective homes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was convinced
once again as she secretly watched his figure moving away from her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Jin shouldn't be in a place like this.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There is no

decision I am about to make will be the best for him.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Gazing up at the full
moon rising faintly in the night sky, Nina's azure eyes gleamed with the light
of determination.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin can still vividly
recall what happened on that fateful day.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was the day,
approaching his thirteenth birthday, when Jin and Rusty, the man who had raised
him, were holding a celebration party together.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was right after he
had swindled a trader out of a large sum of money by posing as a boy with a
psychic ability to foretell the future as well as his guardian. The trick had
been done many times before, but the scale of the job was the largest Jin had
ever undertaken.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The red-faced Rusty
slurped down a bottle of high-quality liquor that didn't fit the shabby
hut-like house, and said.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Listen, Jin,
being a scammer is not a good business."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Indeed. It takes
a lot of time and effort, and it's very risky."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"As long as we
are in this business, we must always maintain a line between us and the rest of
the world. We can't settle down in one place or have a deep relationship with
someone. We have to live in solitude, constantly fighting the fear of being
caught lying and thrown in jail or hell."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But you have me,
so don't worry. You will never be alone."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rusty did not reply to
the words Jin had uttered out of anxiety.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After downing more
than half of his remaining liquor in one gulp, Rusty met Jin's eyes head-on.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin, you're
still a kid. You're not like me, who lost my way a long time ago. You can
forget all the skills I taught you and go on with your life as a normal
person."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait, what are
you saying? Are you telling me to wash my feet after all these years?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Well, it
wouldn't hurt to know that you have a lot of options. You're no longer just a
kid on the street waiting for charity after all."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While being roughly
patted on the head, Jin sensed a disturbing sign.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Always observe your surroundings and be sensitive to
signs of danger.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That's what Rusty had
told him many times. The current conversation felt exactly like a sign of
danger to Jin.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In fact, his
premonition came true.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time Jin woke
up in the late afternoon and realized that sleeping pills had been slipped into
his drink, it was already too late to do anything about it.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was not until a
week later that he learned what had happened to Rusty.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What was featured in a
newspaper that was being handed out on the streets was a fearless smile that he
had always seen up close.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Rusty Yellowkid-Wale,
the &lt;legendary scammer&gt; who made a fortune through credit fraud posing as
a psychic, was finally arrested! His longtime misdeeds have come to an end
thanks to the determined pursuit of the &lt;White Knights&gt;. For nearly 20
years, Rusty has been single-handedly deceiving the masses......]</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Until he read this
article, Jin knew nothing about Rusty.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He did not know that
Rusty was being hunted by the &lt;White Knights&gt;. Nor did he know that Rusty
had figured out that he couldn't escape any longer.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fact that the
&lt;White Knights&gt;, a special agency, had made a move probably meant that
Rusty had been recognized as an enemy of the empire. Jin didn't even want to
imagine how the great sinner who had deceived the country for so long would be
treated in prison.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin repeatedly
condemned his weak self, who had been stupidly put to sleep with drugs and
unilaterally saved without a word of farewell.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was nothing else
a helpless child could do.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's thoughts were
interrupted by a knock at the toilet door.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He wondered how long
he had been here, sitting on the toilet with the lid down. He flushed once and
exited the toilet, so as not to look suspicious.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A pale-faced male
student rushed into the toilet room in turn. The other toilet had been closed
for a long time, and a small line of people were waiting outside the toilet.
This must be a sign that many of the students were extremely nervous.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No wonder, Jin
thought.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Three students in the
entire grade have already been expelled from school as a result of the last
&lt;Chase Tag&gt;.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">If the opponent gains
more seconds than one's own points, one will lose everything at that instant</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">many students must have been reminded of such a cruel
reality once again.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And it was no
different for Jin himself.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The day after he and
Nina went out to town, Jin received a declaration of war from Bennett.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin had 103 points, so
even if he were to lose the upper limit of 50 points in this &lt;Chase Tag&gt;,
it would not be game over for him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, Jin's
reputation as an [unknown powerhouse] that he had built up to this point would
be shattered.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin walked to the
front of the gymnasium, where everyone was assembled, and tried to sort out
Bennett's abilities.</span></span></p>



<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"></p><p class="calibre35"></p><ul class="calibre36"><li class="calibre37"><span class="calibre3">Psychic ability to summon a fire puppet that can think autonomously.</span></li></ul><ul class="calibre36"><li class="calibre37"><span class="calibre3">Not only does the puppet automatically chase after its enemies, but it can also change its shape at will.</span></li></ul><ul class="calibre36"><li class="calibre37"><span class="calibre3">The condition for activation is to keep staring at the light of a match of a specific brand for at least 10 seconds.</span></li></ul><ul class="calibre36"><li class="calibre37"><span class="calibre3">The only weakness is that when the match is extinguished, the fire puppet also disappears with it.</span></li></ul><p class="sc-bdvvtl"></p><ul class="calibre36"><li class="calibre37"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"><span class="calibre3">&nbsp;</span></span></li></ul><p class="sc-bdvvtl"></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre7"></span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre7"></span></p>

<p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst"><span class="calibre7"></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once again, this power
is so extraordinary that it is hard to believe it is at the level of a student.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The activation
conditions are somewhat difficult, and the autonomous thoughts are probably
some kind of a bluff. Perhaps it is just programmed to perform complex actions
in advance. However, even so, it is still more than powerful enough.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To begin with, it is
unusual when the details of one's ability are so well known.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This is nothing but
the reverse side of the fact that Bennett thinks that it is perfectly fine even
if the activation conditions and weaknesses are known.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, Jin decided
to take immediate action.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At lunchtime today, he
approached Bennett from behind on his way to the cafeteria and succeeded in
inserting his hand into the pocket of his coat, which contained a matchbox.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Outstanding
pickpocketing skills. Taking advantage of the crowd, he read his opponent's
line of sight and center of gravity, and then took advantage of the moment of
greatest distraction to complete the job. This degree of skill is nothing less
than child's play to Jin.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if the contents
of the matchbox had been replaced with a different brand of matches, Bennett
would not have noticed.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The instructor called
his name. It is almost time to fight.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin switched his
thoughts and followed Bennett, who was heading into the gymnasium first.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You'd better
give up as soon as the game starts."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett smiled thinly
as soon as they faced each other at their designated positions on the field.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"From what I've
heard, your psychological abilities are not suited for this kind of game.
Besides, I don't want to hurt people in a futile fight either."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin remained silent
and observed Bennett's expression.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A look that is neither
conceited nor careless, a look that is convinced that his victory is the
planned outcome. It was a type of expression he had not seen in many of the
people he had deceived.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, you know
what?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin decided to move
his mouth to disrupt the other party's concentration, even if only a little.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I really feel
for you. If you were lost to an inferior student like me, you'd lose all the
credibility you've built up so far ...... Oh, and that merrymaking party might
be dismantled, too."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Unfortunately, I'm not going to underestimate you. Even if you are someone who
survived a &lt;duel&gt; against Nina. I don't know what kind of dirty tricks
you used after all."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett said in a low
voice. He sounded as if he was holding back the urge to speak too fast with the
power of reason. This is the characteristic of a person who is angry right now.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Looks like his boiling point is lower than I thought.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While calmly judging
the situation, Jin put a vicious smile on his face.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But why are you
getting involved with me? You're giving me the creeps though."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you
pretending to be insensitive?'</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Not that I'm
against being prejudiced, but if it's a romantic thing, I'm not sure I can
handle it."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wha, you can't
be serious."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Or, is it
perhaps because of that? Are you perhaps still mad at me for leaving the
meeting at that time?......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Enough, it's
becoming unpleasant."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett told the
instructor standing outside the field in a cold voice that rejected everything.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Let's start now,
Instructor Isabella. My back's feeling cramped."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As soon as the
starting whistle blew, Bennett lit the match he had taken out of the box.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin is still within
reach once he overcomes an obstacle, but Bennett has yet to chase after him. He
has not moved from his starting position and is just staring at the flame
flickering at the tip of the match.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett seems
confident that the &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt; will be summoned in the
next 10 seconds.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If the matchbox had
been switched, such a future would never have come.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You look so
relaxed, huh, Jin. You are about to be burned you know?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No need to
worry, you can't attack me. It has been decided since the beginning."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......What do
you mean?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why don't you
figure it out for yourself? Maybe it'll be a good exercise for your
brain."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin did not miss the
unstable emotions seeping into Bennett's face.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">He was unable to grasp
what kind of moves his elusive opponent was going to make.</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If that were the case,
there was no other way but to take advantage of that suspicion.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Let me give you
a prediction. Your psychic abilities won't work on me."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, on what
basis ......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If you're not
sure, why don't you try it? Look, I'm not going anywhere."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Ten seconds after
lighting the match, Bennett looked downward. He was probably in a desperate
situation because there was still no sign that his puppet would be summoned.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I guess I hit
the mark after all. I'm honestly surprised myself. So what are you going to do,
Bennett? Are you going to go after me yourself?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett hung his head
and his shoulders seemed to be trembling. Is he that frustrated?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">No, he is not.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin noticed a fatal
fact.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett was now
desperately stifling a burst of laughter.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's
hilarious...... very hilarious, Jin. You don't even know that you've been
fooled by me this whole time."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A blazing fireball
formed in front of Bennett's eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fireball kept
growing like a living creature, and in no time at all, it transformed into a
human form.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Are you kidding
me?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The scheme that Jin
devised during the lunch break had been for naught.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The &lt;Executioner of
Immolation&gt; which was summoned without a hitch, rushed at him, scattering
sparks of fire.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Uwaaaah!"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The spot touched by
the fire sparks was hit by an intense pain that felt as if it melted the marrow
of the bones.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even rolling on the
ground was not enough to extinguish the fire. The spark of fire, which was once
very small, spread rapidly, covering Jin's entire left arm in the blink of an
eye.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Bennett, who had
approached him before he knew it, tapped him on the shoulder, he could think of
nothing else to do but endure the pain.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Calm down. It's
not like you're going to die"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett told him in
the most heartless way possible.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Those flames are
a little special. Not only can I control its temperature and shape, but I can
also control its lethality. With the current configuration, you won't get
burned, even if your whole body is engulfed in flames. ......Unfortunately,
though, the pain is the same as that of ordinary flames."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fact that Bennett
spoke with a tone of voice that even sounded compassionate was unnervingly
frightening.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A flame that never
kills when touched is not something pacifistic.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Never kill the
opponent, only continuously inflicting pain </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> what a torturous ability.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett blew out the
match, and the flames that had covered half of Jin's body disappeared.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Now it's your
turn."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suppressing the urge
to run away, Jin's thoughts drifted back and forth.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Calm down. Think about
the situation calmly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if he could
summon the puppet without any problem, it would still take him 10 seconds to
activate his ability.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">All I have to do is
touch any part of his body before then.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............Ha?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, his faint
hopes were easily shattered the moment after the whistle blew.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Less than two seconds
after Bennett lit the match, the &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt; was summoned
again.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When one thought about
it, it was rather unnatural that such sensitive information about the
activation conditions of psychic ability was being circulated.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was more reasonable
to assume that Bennett had spread misinformation and had misled those around
him into believing his fake weaknesses.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, you don't
have to be so frightened. After all, you're the demon now."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unable to control the
fear that was etched into his body, Jin could not take a single step.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Only one turn was
needed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With just that one
turn, Jin had lost more than 50 seconds of the game.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"With this, the
game is over. I win."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't screw with
me......."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin could not contain
his overflowing emotions.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What kind of
trick did you pull, Bennett!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Trick, huh
...... is that what you call it?"</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett had a troubled
look on his face, as if he were trying to persuade a whining child.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As it was, he
approached Jin slowly and whispered in a voice that the instructor could not
hear.</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's more than
obvious that you're no match for me. ......That's why you tried to switch the
contents of the matchbox, right? But too bad. I replaced it with a spare matchbox
before this game started."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......What are
you talking about?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Aa~, don't play
dumb with me. I've already proven it. As expected, lighting the match you
swapped out didn't trigger my ability. ......That was a close call."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"With this, you
do understand, no? You are not worthy of Nina. No, I think that your very
presence in this academy itself is nothing but a bad joke."</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For the first time in
a long time, Jin remembered.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Is this the taste of
defeat?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett is not just a
monster. He is also a schemer who is willing to manipulate information in order
to defeat his enemies.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As Jin could do
nothing but stand there, the relentless words rained down on him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If you still
don't understand, let me give you a piece of advice. Let Nina go at once. You
have no right to hang around with her, you are not worthy of her. ......If you
won't back down like a grown-up, I'll really burn you down next time, so be
prepared."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">All Jin could do was
stare in utter dismay as Bennett headed for the exit with a blank expression on
his face as if he had completely lost interest.</span></span></p>
