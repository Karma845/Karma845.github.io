<h3>Chapter 8</h3>

<p>Before the sun set, people on the road welcomed us with cheers, since we returned a little earlier than planned.<br />
This was because the knights made it a triumphant return by showcasing the troll&#8217;s head and corpse. I took it out of inventory and arranged it together before we entered the town.<br />
It’s heavy, having to pull it all the way.<br />
Some people prayed for the adventurers who have lost their lives.</p>
<p>We marched triumphantly to the front of the knight order, and were freed by order of Captain Waltz.<br />
For now, I needed to go to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild and report.</p>
<p>[Marl, are you okay? I&#8217;m going to report to the guild as it is, you sure you want to come along?]</p>
<p>[It is fine, let&#8217;s go!]</p>
<p>I headed to the adventurer&#8217;s guild with Marl, who seemed to be excited by the people&#8217;s welcome.<br />
It seems that the other adventurers were divided into those who headed to the guild like us, and those who disbanded and went out into the city.<br />
Apparently, Ethan was going to report as well.</p>
<p>[I thought I&#8217;d go celebrate after getting the money!]</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[Oh, nice to see you back. After you guys left, the goblins came out to the vicinity of the city, and it made me worried. Did something happen?]</p>
<p>Old man Woz looked relieved when he saw us returning.<br />
However, we also have to deliver the unfortunate news.</p>
<p>[So, three died&#8230;]</p>
<p>We were told that the adventurer&#8217;s guild would work together to bury the corpses of the dead adventurers under the knight’s command.<br />
The guild would also collect the belongings and deliver them to the bereaved family if there were any.<br />
The corpses will be buried in the city&#8217;s cemetery.<br />
It seemed that adventurer cards had been used as dog tags, since one of the veteran adventurers gave Woz the adventurer cards of the three dead men.</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>[Everyone, let me check the adventurer cards.]</p>
<p>Following the old man&#8217;s words, the adventurers submitted their adventurer cards.<br />
The guild staff will check each one and pay the subjugation reward accordingly.</p>
<p>[Hey, is this guy real?]</p>
<p>Old man Woz let out a surprised voice after checking my adventurer card.<br />
That&#8217;s right, the three trolls I defeated must’ve been recorded there.</p>
<p>[Boss, it&#8217;s true. I was at the front at the time, but the boy used magic to kill one with the Knights, and then burned three more trolls with magic.]</p>
<p>[Yeah, I saw it too. No doubt about it. After that, he killed one of the trolls he burned in one blow, and then killed another one.]</p>
<p>[He beat the last one to death with his bare hands.]</p>
<p>[Are you kidding me?]</p>
<p>[Seriously. He mounted the troll and crazily pummeled it.]</p>
<p>[I mean, you brought a troll corpse, didn&#8217;t you? Bring that out.]</p>
<p>The adventurers who participated in the subjugation testify to my achievements.<br />
Hahahaha, don&#8217;t praise me so much.<br />
We were guided to the guild&#8217;s warehouse and moved in droves.</p>
<p>[Don&#8217;t be surprised, it will be a fortune.]</p>
<p>Looking at the three troll corpses lined up on the warehouse floor, old man Woz groaned.<br />
The corpses of monsters brought in by adventurers were released to the market as raw materials.<br />
Of course, the market price was higher than the purchase price, since part of the profit was returned to the adventurer&#8217;s guild.<br />
In short, the more monster corpses brought in by adventurers, the more profitable the guild will be.</p>
<p>[How long will it take?]</p>
<p>[Troll skin and bones can be used as materials for useful weapons, fat can be used as an alchemy material, and meat can be sold at a high price. I don&#8217;t know until it’s inspected, but it should be about 30 gold coins per unit. Since the subjugation reward was also 5 gold coins per confirmed kill, it may be about 105 gold coins by simple calculation.]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s quite exorbitant earnings, isn&#8217;t it?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>105 gold coins was equivalent to 10.5 million yen when converted.<br />
An adventurer of my rank normally shouldn’t be able to make that much money.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[For adventurers! Cheeerss!]</p>
<p>[&#8220;Cheeerss!&#8221;]</p>
<p>We raised our cups and toasted each other.<br />
After receiving the subjugation reward, I declared that we’d celebrate on the spot, and about 20 adventurers who participated in the subjugation and the adventurers who were there tagged along, so we ended up renting out a bar.<br />
Five gold coins were blown away because it was all-you-can-drink and all-you-can-eat, but there should be no problem with such a large amount of money.<br />
It&#8217;s much better than earning jealousy from others because I made too much money.<br />
There were some female adventurers who joined in, but Marl-san stuck to me (physically) and guarded me.<br />
Ah, say goodbye to boing-boing boobs.</p>
<p>That night, I ate a lot, drank and made a noise, and when the party was over, I returned to the inn and slept like a log.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>The next morning.<br />
When I was playing a prank on Marl after waking up, we got too excited.<br />
It devolved into morning sex. I guess both of us accumulated a lot of stress after the march and battle.<br />
Marl yeah, there was a slight difference in physical strength, which made me crazy.<br />
Now she’s sleeping(?) using my arm as a pillow.</p>
<p>But, that&#8217;s it. Anyways, that&#8217;s an easy win.<br />
For some reason, I had inadvertently accepted Marl.<br />
If you played with a girl you liked every night, oh! I think it&#8217;s no wonder that I&#8217;m entangled like this.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m not bad. It’s natural as a boy, right?</p>
<p>For the time being, I used life magic’s purification to cleanse the bed and each other&#8217;s bodies before relaxing again.<br />
When I opened the menu and checked it, my level was 12. There were also 42 unused skill points.<br />
While confirming, Marl was resurrected.</p>
<p>[Mmm&#8230;you’re too intense this morning.]</p>
<p>While saying something like that, she rubbed against me and kissed me.<br />
Don&#8217;t be stupid, you’ll only excite me again.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what to do!</p>
<p>[Mufu, Taichi-san is already messing with me again.]</p>
<p>[Noisy idiot, I&#8217;ll tease you]</p>
<p>[Ah&#8230; Hmm, hey, Taichi-san]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>The moment I started flirting again, the door opened with a great noise.<br />
Looking toward the open door, stood Phinea with a blue streak.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m sorry for barging in, but customers, will you please leave the room because I want to clean it soon&#8230;?]</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[Ufufu, if I had not asked for contraceptive magic, I would definitely have been impregnated in the last few days.]</p>
<p>Marl was laughing happily while saying something new.<br />
It seemed that female adventurers could use the guild&#8217;s service to cast contraceptive magic in advance if they wished.<br />
It&#8217;s easy to get involved in various troubles, and it seems that there were obscene monsters who used human women to breed, so it&#8217;s a necessary measure.</p>
<p>But, an obscene monster huh…nope, don’t think too much about it.</p>
<p>Another reason was to prevent women who wanted to continue being adventurers from becoming pregnant and being forced to quit.<br />
Before the spread of contraceptive magic, it was common for the party to be disbanded because one of the women in the mixed-gender party of four became pregnant.<br />
Even if the pregnancy was desired or because of love, if the party disbanded, the other two or three people would be in trouble.<br />
It would be nice if they could find a new party, but it seems that this was unexpectedly difficult.</p>
<p>And now that the adventurers had proven their worth, the contraceptive magic also became quite popular among the general public.<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s helpful because I can do various things without hesitation.&#8221; or something along that line.</p>
<p>[Well, what are we going to do today? The profit from the sale of the troll should keep us afloat for a while, so would you like to go on a date?]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>Marle looked up at me with a blank face.<br />
What was that reaction?<br />
Is it possible that you think I&#8217;m a person who does nothing else but training and work?</p>
<p>[What is it, do you hate it?]</p>
<p>[No! No no no! Let&#8217;s go!]</p>
<p>Marl pulled my arm with excitement.<br />
Oh, take a look at her sparkling eyes. Cute.<br />
By the way, one troll corpse sold for 35 gold coins.<br />
Including the goblin subjugation reward, this time it was a big profit.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[So, why is the weapon shop the first stop&#8230;?]</p>
<p>Marl looked at me with a questioning stare.</p>
<p>[Well, my sword broke in yesterday&#8217;s battle. Marl has a sword on her waist, but if I&#8217;m a man and I don&#8217;t have a sword on his waist, it won&#8217;t look cool, right?]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pain to walk with the battle staff.<br />
Looking at my waist, then looking at her own waist, Marl nodded a little.</p>
<p>[Sure, as a woman, I will be fine without a sword, but Taichi-san without a sword will be weird.]</p>
<p>Right? Then I went to the counter at the back of the store.<br />
It seemed that Louise was there today, but she was already serving other customers.<br />
I called out to the cat shopkeeper who was smoking from a smoking pipe at the counter.</p>
<p>[Welcome, what do you need today?]</p>
<p>[Oh, give me a sword. The kind that won’t shatter even if you try to crack the troll&#8217;s head with Magic Strike.]</p>
<p>The cat shopkeeper raised his eyebrows at my order.<br />
Oh, this was stupid. I can tell by the air.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s too early for a pauper who didn&#8217;t even know about Magic Strike until a while ago. You should train and start over&#8212;&#8211;]</p>
<p>I put magical power on my fingertips before the shopkeeper could finish their words, and pushed it out at their face.<br />
The shopkeeper reacted immediately by putting magical power into the smoking pipe to intercept my fingertips.</p>
<p>Pan.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper&#8217;s smoke pipe was lightly flipped with a popping sound.<br />
The shopkeeper&#8217;s slit cat&#8217;s eyes open wide.</p>
<p>[&#8230;shocking]</p>
<p>The owner probably intended to hit my fingertips back.<br />
On the contrary, it seems that he was surprised when the smoke pipe was flipped.<br />
The owner gave up smoking and missed it, probably because the contents of the smoke tube had completely popped and disappeared.</p>
<p>[But, it&#8217;s expensive, you know? How much is your budget?]</p>
<p>[Hmm, that&#8217;s right. For the time being, how about 10 gold coins?]</p>
<p>[Nn, that’ll do.]</p>
<p>The owner left the counter and started walking.<br />
What&#8217;s this, you look cute from the back.<br />
That&#8217;s right, there were cats, but there were no dogs, right?<br />
I&#8217;m more of a dog person, so I really want to love you.</p>
<p>When I looked at Marl, she was staring at the cat shop owner with a very passionate gaze. Was it cute even from the perspective of people in this world?</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[This and this and this and that. There are some that are a little more expensive, but 10 gold coins isn&#8217;t enough.]</p>
<p>The shopkeeper brought out a sword with a blade length similar to the shortsword I had been using until now.<br />
Since there were three swords, I pulled them out of their scabbards and checked the weight and grip.</p>
<p>[Hmm, it&#8217;s good as a secondary weapon, but it&#8217;s a bit too light. Isn&#8217;t it just right for Marl?]</p>
<p>Saying that, I let Marl hold the sword as well.<br />
She seemed to like one of them, and was staring at it intently.<br />
Marl chose a greenish, curved bladed, metal sword with carved pattern representing the wind.<br />
A similar pattern was also finely engraved on the pommel.</p>
<p>[Do you like it?]</p>
<p>[Huh? Ah, I thought it was beautiful. It&#8217;s lighter than it looks.]</p>
<p>Saying that, Marle sheathed the sword back.<br />
Hmm, you seemed to like it.</p>
<p>[Shopkeeper, do you have a longer blade?]</p>
<p>[Yes, I think this is good for Onii-san.]</p>
<p>Saying that, the owner brought a long sword that was well made.<br />
When I received it and pulled it out of its scabbard, the pure white blade was exposed.<br />
The weight of the blade was perfect, and with a blade this long, it should be able to behead a troll in a single swing.<br />
Above all, it had a rustic feel with no unnecessary decorations.</p>
<p>[Good, I like it. I&#8217;ll buy this and this, so give me a discount.]</p>
<p>I said so and picked up the longsword recommended by the shop owner and the short sword that Marl had been looking at earlier.<br />
Marl seemed to be busy deciding on a new crossbow, and she’s totally unaware of it.</p>
<p>[If so, I&#8217;ll sell it for 24 gold coins instead of 25 gold coins. But, can you pay?]</p>
<p>[Fuhahaha, don’t worry. I have the money right here.]</p>
<p>That said, I gave the shopkeeper exactly 24 gold coins.<br />
The shopkeeper&#8217;s eyes wide open again.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>[Shocking&#8230; What&#8217;s with such a large sum of money all of a sudden?]</p>
<p>[I killed about three trolls and sold their corpses. Troll materials and their armor will be on the market soon, right?]</p>
<p>[Ayeee, Onii-san really is shocking.]</p>
<p>I put my newly bought longsword in the sword belt on my waist and checked its condition.<br />
As for the short sword, let&#8217;s see the timing later and give it to Marl.</p>
<p>[Hmm, this one is made of Mithril.]</p>
<p>[Indeed, both swords are made of Mithril. Mithril is a strong metal that is hard, does not break, does not bend, does not decay, and does not chip. It has a high affinity with magical power, so it is so easy to use Magic Strike with it. It won&#8217;t break into pieces. ]</p>
<p>When I looked at the longsword with an appraisal eye, it was displayed as a Mithril Sword.<br />
It seems that there was no special attribute given, but its raw stats as a weapon seemed to be high.</p>
<p>[The other one is installed with a gem containing magical power of the wind. It has the magical power of speeding up and reducing the weight of the weapon so that it can be wielded more easily.]</p>
<p>When I looked at it with an appraisal eye, the short sword was displayed as a mithril dagger.<br />
As the cat shop owner said, it seems to have been enchanted with a wind attribute, speed enhancement, and weight reduction magic.</p>
<p>[Thank you, and give my regards to Louise.]</p>
<p>[Anytime.]</p>
<p>I bid farewell to the shop owner who was fluttering with paws, and left the weapon shop with Marl.<br />
Louise seemed to be still caught by the previous customer.<br />
Leaving me in a bad mood. I&#8217;m currently on a date with Marle, so let&#8217;s not pretend to get involved.</p>
<p>After that, it became a normal date.<br />
Wandering around to buy and eat, watching street performers in the central square, and looking around for clothes and accessories.</p>
<p>[Well, Marl didn&#8217;t have much luggage. What are you doing with your clothes?]</p>
<p>A girl would want all kinds of clothes.<br />
What&#8217;s more, she&#8217;s a genuine Princess.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>[If there’s too much, it would cause excessive baggage&#8230;though I really want a little more clothes.]</p>
<p>She laughed bitterly.<br />
Certainly, if you didn&#8217;t have inventory like me, you can&#8217;t have too many clothes.<br />
Aside from renting a house or setting up a base for activities.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;ll put it in my inventory, so it&#8217;s okay.]</p>
<p>[Umm&#8230;]</p>
<p>It seems that she was still refraining despite my concession.<br />
Should I give her another push?</p>
<p>[I also want to see Marl in cute clothes.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say, from how it ended, I pushed too much.<br />
It was already evening when I noticed that we’ve probably gone through most if not all the used clothing stores in town.<br />
For me, I was able to buy a dancer-style costume with a high degree of exposure, so I was satisfied.<br />
Though, my fatigue was higher than satisfaction.<br />
By the way, I also bought some clothes for myself.<br />
Currently, I was taking a break on the bench installed in the corner of the central square.</p>
<p>[Ah, it was fun! It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been shopping like this!]</p>
<p>Marl leaned her body on the bench while having a very wide smile as she stretched.<br />
She often smiled, but this is probably my first time seeing her smiling such a radiant smile.</p>
<p>The evening bell would ring soon.<br />
Most stores closed once the bell rang. People went home and had a family dinner or went out to the bar.</p>
<p>Marl was given 10 gold coins as a reward for exterminating trolls.<br />
In the last troll battle, she told me their weaknesses in advance, and she also supported me with an arrow.<br />
That support was a tad bit too dangerous though.</p>
<p>In addition, 20 gold coins were donated to our living funds.<br />
By the way, I was paying for all the new outfits she bought from this living fund.<br />
It was decided that all food, clothing, and shelter would be taken out from here.</p>
<p>[Well, I learned a lot.]</p>
<p>It was a shock to me that second-hand clothing stores were the only ready-made clothes in this world.<br />
And none were the same.<br />
If you think about it, it&#8217;s only natural, but it&#8217;s because all the clothes were handmade.<br />
There was no mass production system, so each one was handmade.<br />
If you didn&#8217;t make it yourself, you would naturally have to have it tailored, so it seems that new clothes will be ridiculously expensive.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>So, the common people made their own clothes.<br />
If you don&#8217;t wear it anymore, sell it.<br />
Other people would buy and use it.<br />
And once they didn&#8217;t wear it anymore, they sold it.</p>
<p>So, there were quite a few merchants who specialize in used clothing.<br />
Basically, there were many plain clothes that could be worn for a long time, but there were also cute and risqué ones among them.</p>
<p>[Um, Taichi-san. Are you really going to wear that outfit?]</p>
<p>[I bought it with great effort, so you have to wear it.]</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m sure you are grinning ear to ear right now.]</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t be helped, no matter how you look at it, I made her buy a risqué outfit that would be worn by someone in that line of work.<br />
Marl is a cute type, but I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what kind of chemical reaction will occur when she wears such an erotic costume.</p>
<p>[Oh yeah, I have another present for you.]</p>
<p>Saying that, I took out the Mithril Dagger I got from the weapon shop from my storage and handed it over to Marl who was sitting next to me.<br />
Marl, who received it, opened her mouth dumbfounded.<br />
Okay, rejoice.</p>
<p>[Hey!? Eh!? Are you serious!?]</p>
<p>Saying that, I folded my arms.<br />
It is a pose that does not accept returns.</p>
<p>[There are various reasons, but I&#8217;m not going to explain too much. Don&#8217;t say anything. Do you understand?]</p>
<p>She seemed to like it, so I wanted to buy it.<br />
That&#8217;s the main reason.</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>Marl&#8217;s face turned bright red and she looked down.<br />
What? Is something wrong with you?<br />
The people around me are also looking at me and sending me smiles.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>I managed to pull Marl, who was holding her sword to her chest and bowed down, and returned to the scorching anvil pavilion.<br />
Phinea quickly noticed and approached us.</p>
<p>[Welcome back, what&#8217;s wrong&#8230; Hoho?]</p>
<p>Seeing Marl hugging the Mithril Shortsword, Piña began to grin.<br />
I wonder what it is, I had a bad feeling already.</p>
<p>[Hehehehe, no matter what you do, you can&#8217;t keep your brother in the corner. Above all, giving her a mithril dagger. Isn&#8217;t that great, Marl?]</p>
<p>Phinea poked her elbow at me with a grin that doesn&#8217;t match her appearance.<br />
No matter how you look at it, she&#8217;s a teenage girl, but to my surprise, this girl was much older than me and is actually the proprietress of this place.<br />
I mean, I thought she was the boss&#8217; daughter, but turns out she was actually his wife.<br />
This is a shocking fact that I learned just the other day. Damn the dwarf physiology.</p>
<p>But I still couldn&#8217;t figure it out.<br />
I wonder what this reaction is.</p>
<p>[Hey, is there any special meaning in giving a mithril dagger?]</p>
<p>[[Eh?]]</p>
<p>For some reason, the atmosphere in the place hardened.</p>
<p>[Umm? Then why did Taichi-san give it&#8230;?]</p>
<p>[? Marl seemed to like it, and I thought it would be good to protect herself.]</p>
<p>At my words, Phinea smiled while her face was twitching, while Marl held her sword close to her chest, looking like she was about to cry.</p>
<p>[Oh, I don&#8217;t really understand, but don&#8217;t cry, don&#8217;t cry. Phinea, I&#8217;m sorry, but please explain the situation.]</p>
<p>For the time being, I hugged Marl who was about to cry and patted her head while asking Phinea for an explanation.<br />
This reaction was probably a special custom that I don&#8217;t know about.<br />
As for Marl, she pressed her face against my shoulder and started crying.<br />
Umu, different world cultures are difficult.</p>
<p>[Ah, hmm, don&#8217;t you really know? I think it&#8217;s common sense.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>[I really don&#8217;t understand. I&#8217;ve been training with my master in the countryside for a long time, and honestly there I know very little of what is considered as common sense here.]</p>
<p>In my words, Phinea slammed her forehead.<br />
And with a defeated voice&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>[Usually, when a man gives a woman a Mithril dagger, it means, &#8220;Become mine, protect your chastity&#8221;. What else do you think it means? ]</p>
<p>[Wait, is that a so-called marriage proposal? Proposing?]</p>
<p>[What else is there?]</p>
<p>Is it common sense? I could only look up at the ceiling.<br />
I didn&#8217;t know, I was innocent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>Marl with a crying face was sitting on the bed, and I&#8217;m sitting on a chair facing each other.</p>
<p>[&#8230;shouldn’t you be like, preparing dinner? Get back to work.]</p>
<p>[I can&#8217;t just leave the crying girl all alone.]</p>
<p>For some reason, Phinea, who was standing beside us, glared at me while saying so.<br />
It’s not like I wanted to make her cry or something.</p>
<p>[Ah, Marl. Can you listen to me?]</p>
<p>Marl, with Mithril dagger on her lap, nodded. Her face was downcast.<br />
At least she’s still willing to listen to me.</p>
<p>[To be honest, I gave you the sword without knowing the custom.]</p>
<p>Marl started sniffling again at my words.<br />
Stop it, my heart&#8217;s HP was nearing zero.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>[But, about that, uh&#8230;]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to say at such times.<br />
Calm down, I should go straight in such a case.</p>
<p>I picked up a Mithril dagger from above Marl&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>Marl raised her face to my actions and her eyes dyed in despair.<br />
When I glanced sideways, Phinea was showing an utterly disappointed face.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Please receive it again]</p>
<p>I held the Mithril dagger with both hands and presented it to Marl.<br />
Marl was stunned, probably not expecting what was happening for a moment.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Yes!]</p>
<p>She received it with a big smile on her crying and swollen face.<br />
Phinea went out of the room while saying ah yes yes feast.<br />
That&#8217;s why I told you to go out from the beginning.<br />
I sat back next to Marl, took out the handkerchief from the inventory and wiped Marl&#8217;s face.<br />
Marl stood still obediently while I wiped her face, up until I switched to tickling her instead. Then, I hugged and pushed her down.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m happy.]</p>
<p>[I can see that.]</p>
<p>I stroked her head, and rained kisses on her.<br />
It&#8217;s going to be a long night today.</p>

<p><strong>～Weapon materials～ </strong></p>
<p>The materials used for weapons in this world were roughly divided into two.<br />
The first was minerals, ranging from ordinary ores such as copper, iron, steel, brass, and silver to magic ores such as mithril, light quartz, and orichalcum.<br />
The other was monster part materials such as leather, shells, bones, and fangs produced by monsters.<br />
Ordinary ore weapons were relatively easy to process, and the ones that were inexpensive and made by skilled blacksmiths were sturdy and were the most widely distributed.<br />
Magic ore weapons were difficult to handle and were expensive due to the low production of magic ore itself, but they were very high performance.<br />
Weapons that used parts of monsters were truly diverse, from head to toe.<br />
This was because the quality of materials for the same part of the same monster varied.<br />
However, there were cases in which weapons that used the parts of high-ranking monsters such as dragons had performance that surpassed weapons made of magic ores.<br />
In many cases, they were generally lighter in weight than metal, and some people liked to use weapons made from parts of monsters.</p>
