<h3>Chapter 8: Planned Betrayal, Despair for the Fraudster</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As he played with the
counterfeit coins he always carried in his pocket with his fingertips, Jin
thought back to his life before he ended up at this school - the days he spent
with that lousy, eccentric, but still top-notch scammer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was a line Rusty
used to say to him after he did the occasional big job.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... You have
nothing. You have no family, no education, not even a childlike affection, let
alone any psychic abilities. Jin, if we who have nothing want to earn a decent
living, we have to be cunning. And that's exactly what we're going to do, even
if it means deceiving someone we don't know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After saying all that,
Rusty's face would always turn serious.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"There's one thing
you must never forget. Listen, Jin, for a fraudster</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It's a sentence I've
heard so many times, but I'm still not entirely understand what Rusty was
actually trying to say.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What was he thinking
at that moment, what was he trying to entrust to me?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Time did not allow him
to think any further.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The battle against a
powerful enemy, Bennett Lohr, was about to begin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He had laid many
strategic moves to get to this point. The traps were already set. Once
everything was in place, all he had to do was to face the battle with
determination.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin took a deep breath
to regain his composure, and put his hand on the door of his room.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Three days after the
declaration of war.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The stage Bennett had
designated was a tree-lined path lined with tall trees. Apparently, there had
been a trailhead ahead before the empire bought the land, but now it was
completely abandoned, with weeds protruding from every nook and cranny of the
concrete path.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett showed a smile
of amusement to Jin, who arrived at exactly one o'clock in the afternoon, the
appointed time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... You
showed up without running away, huh? Honestly, I was surprised."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin decided to reply
with a fearless smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't give me
such a half-baked impression. Why don't we just hurry up and get started?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Chill out, will
you? We have to make a pledge first."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A written pledge was
carefully written in thin handwriting and handed to Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"This
&lt;duel&gt; will be conducted in accordance with the rules written in
it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Direct attacks
with psychic abilities are allowed, and you win if you can make your opponent
surrender or faint. The loser loses fifty-three points. ...... Nothing unusual,
huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course. I
like fairness after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By filling out the
rules and the signatures of the participants on the form provided by the
school, the &lt;duel&gt; will automatically be established. Jin signed the
pledge while being amazed at the omniscience and omnipotence of the headmaster
who can manage the increase and decrease of points and even implement
memory-sealing measures with just a single piece of paper.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Look, the
witness seems to have arrived as well."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As though in response
to Bennett's mutterings, a palm-sized object descended from far above.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The tin cat puppet
that called itself Jake decelerated unnaturally just before it hit the ground
and landed in front of them as if nothing had happened.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Good grief, kids
nowadays sure are rough. How many &lt;duel&gt;s have we had today alone? Well,
I'm made from tin, so I don't feel tired.]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jake, could you
please check the pledges?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Aa~, don't bother
showing it to me. As soon as you fill out the pledge form, I'll know what your
rules are.]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, right, of
course."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Alright, lastly, a
reminder. As long as you follow the rules written in the pledge, I won't
interfere at all. So don't make the mistake of asking for help. ...... So, are
you ready for this?]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What a long
introduction. Let's get on with it." Jin said so, sounding fed up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Indeed. Let's
get started then." Bennett replied with an exemplary smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[All right, let the
games begin.]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before Jake could
finish his declaration, Bennett pulled a matchbox out of his coat pocket. This
small object that fits in his palm is all he needs to activate his psychic
ability that summon an evil demon.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The match was scraped
against the side of the box and the tip was lit.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A small spark is
created in front of Bennett, as if the air itself is spontaneously ignited. The
spark eventually grew into a fireball, which quickly increased in volume and
intensity.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When the fireball
began to change into the shape of a person, Jin ran away at once.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Hahaha.
What's the matter, Jin Kirihara!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett called out
while holding back his laughter.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Where was all
that bravado you had just now go? Don't you have the will to fight me
head-on?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although he seemed to
be criticizing Jin, Bennett's face was filled with glee.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was like the smile
of a hunter chasing after fleeing prey.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Feeling the dense
presence of death behind him, Jin ran through the trees.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Under the guise of a
seemingly foolhardy escape, he was heading toward a location he had decided
upon in advance. He hid behind a large tree about 30 meters away from Bennett,
who was walking slowly, and checked on his opponent.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He is not negligent in
his strategy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He already prepared a
plan to defeat his opponent, who can manipulate a fire monster at will.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> Two days ago </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the tree-lined
avenue where the duel would take place, 13 landscapers were at work. It was
already around 2:00 am.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Jin arrived,
Gasta laughed with a cigarette in his mouth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What, you're
alone this time? Have you broken up with your girlfriend now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's not like
we're in a relationship to begin with."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So there are a
lot of things happening in the world of kids, huh? By the way, what is the
purpose of this job?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Gasta's question is
understandable.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The work started the
day after Jin made a phone call to the company and had to be completed in just
two days. Even though he was being paid extra for the work, Gasta would never
have taken on the job had it not been for Jin's long-standing relationship with
the company.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Because of the
urgency of the request, I called on my colleagues and somehow managed to get a
headcount together. To be honest, I'm nervous about working with people whose
faces I don't even know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"All you have to
do is build a pit filled with water according to the layout I gave you
yesterday, though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I mean, isn't it
too simple? Your opponent this time is quite a monster, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Obviously, I've
got a lot of plans."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett is not just a
monster with a powerful psychic ability. He is much more cautious and sensitive
to lies than Tedd, whom he defeated using the same pit method. If he wanted to
deceive such an opponent, he would have to put up a clever and multi-layered
scheme.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, since Jin has
a pretty good idea of what Bennett is up to.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Then all he has to do
is to take advantage of it. There is nothing more fragile than a person who
thinks he has seen through his opponent's trickery.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Whether he was
convinced by Jin's confident expression, Gasta snorted once and then changed
the subject. A whisper that no one but Jin could hear. A serious one at that.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So, this kid
Bennett or whatever he's called is the Shepherd's Dog?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After a swift sweep of
the surroundings, Jin also whispered back.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'd say the odds
are 50-50. Although it's a little too obvious, in terms of ability, he's
perfect. His movements so far have been quite suspicious after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then, there's no
turning back now."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why are you
asking me this now? I am already prepared for that before I even try to take
the entrance exam."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I see. Looks
like, I asked a silly question."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Laughing loudly, Gasta
slapped Jin hard on the back.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well then, you
little shit, do well. ...... Right, you coming to work tomorrow?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I have some
other business to do. I'll pass."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ha~, scammer
sure are busy folks, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a flick of his
hand, Jin's oldest accomplice went back to his work.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While hiding behind a
tree, Jin checked on his pursuer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett, walking with
a fire puppet by his side, showed no sign of urgency. His unwavering smile
indicated that he would be able to catch Jin easily if push came to shove.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's the
matter, Jin Kirihara!? Are you planning to stay hidden for a long time? Haven't
you already prepared something to defeat me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett, who did not
even doubt his own victory, showed no sign of alarm. But that was probably an
act. It would be impossible for such a cautious man not to suspect the
possibility of a trap.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In order to disturb
his opponent's thinking as much as possible, Jin moved the tip of his tongue.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I always fight
fair and square, no matter who I'm up against. Do you think I have any secret
plans?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"Fair and square,
huh? That's the least fitting word for you. Oh, by the way, </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's voice was
frosty, a complete change from his elegant tone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you sure you
don't need to watch behind you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time Jin turned
around, it was all too late.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's hands were
handcuffed, his legs were swept away, and he was rolled to the ground.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A brief glimpse of his
former accomplice appeared in his vision. Nina Stingray was approaching from
behind, completely invisible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm sorry,
Jin."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Jin looked up
from his slumped position, Nina was staring at the void with a somber
expression on her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> I didn't think she'd gone this far.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin had taught her the
basics of the art of tailing when they had framed their previous instructor,
Rudy, but when combined with a level of acting ability that allowed her to
control even her own presence, her performance had actually reached this level
of ferociousness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thank you, Nina.
You did a perfect job."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">An exaggerated round
of applause cut through the silence.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A loud laugh, full of
insanity and relish. Bennett no longer even wore the mask of an honor student.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're so
pathetic, Jin. To be betrayed by your one and only accomplice, and ended up
crawling on the ground. Can you tell me how you feel now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, he had
expected Bennett to join forces with Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Still, he had not
expected to be restrained after being approached from behind. Nina's ability
was far beyond Jin's perception.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"I'm listening.
You've installed several water-filled pits in this area, haven't you?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Surely that's the best way to counter my abilities.
Too bad it would be the end once I knew where they were located."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A desperate situation.
Even so, Jin's smile did not fade from his mouth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Yes, so far,
everything is still within his expectations.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, who knew about
the existence of the &lt;landscapers&gt;, would have immediately thought of the
possibility that Jin might manipulate the stage. With her tailing skills, as
she had just demonstrated, it would be easy for her to hide in the dark and
watch the work being done.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That was why Jin had
deliberately mentioned the existence of the pitfall in a loud voice at that
time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Hearing this, Nina
would try to take advantage of the workers and steal the layout map. Of course,
to make it easier for an amateur thief like Nina to steal, Jin had everyone's
layout maps and luggage placed some distance away from the work area.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In other words, Nina
had taken the bait.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">She wasn't even aware
that the layout on the map was a complete fabrication. </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">────</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Three meters to go.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett, approaching
with a cruel smile on his face, would have fallen into the pit if he had gone a
little further straight. That, of course, was not what was shown on the fake
layout map used as bait.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If Bennett still
believed himself to be on the winning side, he would not be able to avoid this
trap.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You should be
feeling the heat from the [Executioner of Immolation] by now. How are you
feeling?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Two meters to go.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But I'm
disappointed. I thought you'd entertain me more. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">One meter to go.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He still didn't doubt
his victory.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">With a graceful
movement, Bennett stepped forward </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> and stopped abruptly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Wha?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A shocking sight
appeared in Jin's eyes, as he raised his voice in a dazed manner.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett began to walk
around the outside of the pit.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A move that could only
be explained if he had a perfect grasp of where the real pit was.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But it was a
clever move. A fake layout map."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What do you mean
......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's voice came down
from overhead, interrupting his bitter rebuttal.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm really
grateful to you. Jin, meeting you and ...... realizing that I'm not the only
one suffering and fighting has certainly brought me relief."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Your actions
don't match your speech, are you sane?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You kept pushing
me around, but I still had fun. I will never forget the month I spent feeling
so much freedom and hope."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If that's what
you think, then get the cuffs off me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina shook her head
tiredly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, Jin. Our
accompliceship is over. I'll get you out of this hellhole."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> Two days ago </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina picked up
the layout map on top of the luggage, while the landscapers continued their
work.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Then a gut
feeling came over her like an electric current.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">There would be
no way that Jin Kirihara, a fraudster who had turned the world into his enemy,
would do such a careless thing.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">He would
surely set up double or triple traps to outsmart them.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">This layout is
definitely a fake. At the very least, she should check it first.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The next day,
Nina took a day off from class and went into town. The purpose was to procure
work clothes. During last night's reconnaissance, she had confirmed that the
clothes worn by the contractors were inconsistent. She also knew that due to
the short deadline, they had asked for reinforcements from contractors whose
names and faces did not seem to match. And that the work would be done again
tonight.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">So Nina
decided to brazenly infiltrate and see for herself the placement of the
pitfalls.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Without a
doubt, this was the most difficult performance to date. She disguised herself
as a man and tried to blend in with the landscapers, even if it only lasted a
few minutes.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">But Nina
pulled it off.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">She changed
her voice and acted as if she had been there from the beginning, and
disappeared as soon as she had the location of the pits drilled into her head.
She was careful to position herself out of sight of the cautious Gasta.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina was
probably unaware of it, but there would be no other person in the entire empire
who could perform such a divine feat with such ease.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">His maneuver
paid off, and Bennett succeeded in advancing through the safe zone and
approaching Jin's side.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Of course,
there was no sense of accomplishment. The real work began from here.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Jin,
behave yourself and surrender."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">I have to stop Jin.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I must stop Jin before Bennett's &lt;Executioner of
Immolation&gt; incinerates him.</span></span></i></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"People
who delude themselves into thinking they're the ones doing the deceiving are
fragile ....... I'm sure Rusty has told you that much."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The expression
on Jin's face as he fell into a slumped position was unclear. Nina felt a pang
of guilt pierced her heart like a hot needle.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">She should
have known how prepared Jin was to come to the academy.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">There was no
way she could not imagine the pain of being betrayed by someone she had
trusted.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Even so, Nina
had no choice but to persist in believing in the justice of her decision.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">She had no
choice but to do what she had to do in order to save Jin from the path that
would lead to his doom.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Hurry
up, Jin. I don't want you to get hurt."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"If you
surrender, you'll just get kicked out of the academy."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"That's
right. What's wrong with that? Don't you see what's happening? If you don't
surrender, you'll be burned alive."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Still, Jin did
not listen to the persuasion and rolled on the ground to get away from the
&lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt;.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">But it's no
use.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">It was obvious
that if Bennett was willing, he could catch up to him in an instant.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Gosh,
don't be so stubborn! You really should do something about that character of
yours!"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"I hate
it most when people tell me what to do."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Don't
act like a fool! What do you think how I feel right now ......?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
It's all right, Nina." Bennett smiled at her calmly. "Just a little
bit of threat and he'll change his mind."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">At Bennett's
signal, the flaming puppet swung its arms out horizontally.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The sparks of
fire carried by the hot air showered down on Jin's entire body, causing him to
let out a cry of anguish from the back of his throat.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Seeing Jin
still trying to escape, Bennett kept on shooting fire sparks at him two or
three times.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
Hurry up, just give up. Why did you have to go this far?"</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The fire
sparks were still dancing through the air, and the cries of anguish turned into
screams.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Actually, Nina
wanted an ending that would allow Jin to escape from the school without harming
him.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">But somewhere
in the depths of her heart, she also knew that such a pipe dream was
impossible.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Jin was not a
fair-minded person who would succumb to someone's threats and admit defeat. He
was not built to be weak like that.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Suddenly, she
noticed that a smile was plastered on the side of Bennett's face as he was
manipulating the puppet.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">It was not the
usual kind of smile that conveyed the confidence of a powerful individual.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">It was a
delightful smile.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">He currently
finds pleasure in the act of tormenting an unresisting opponent.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
Such a handy ability you have there, Bennett."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">While gasping
in pain, Jin squeezed his voice out.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"You can
keep inflicting pain worse than death without ever killing your opponent.......
What's more, your victim's memory would be sealed and he or she would be
expelled from the academy. I can think of a million ways to abuse this ability
of yours."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Oh, I
guess it's about time to shut your mouth."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The
&lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt; moved in response to Bennett's ruthless
declaration.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">A mass of fire
with a will slowly approached Jin, who was crawling on the ground.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Step by step,
it reaffirmed its intent to kill.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina was no
longer sure if it would be enough to merely inflict pain.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">She wondered
if Bennett would really kill Jin.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
Wait, Bennett-san? Is it really gonna be all right?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Haha,
stop pretending to be worried. Nina,...... you are someone who, like me, should
be standing above the others. What does it matter what happens to him?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"You only
want to hurt him, right? There's no way you would, you know, really kill him or
anything like that, right ......?"</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">In the end,
Bennett did not respond, instead, he kept his amused smile on his face as he
watched everything play out.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina felt as
if her whole body was being scraped from the inside out.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">She had
decided to team up with Bennett to save Jin from his own destructive desires.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">But what if
Bennett really intended to commit a crime?</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">No, that
possibility is by no means low.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">There was no
rule in the pledge that forbade murder.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"You
still seem to be still in a relaxed atmosphere, Jin. Is it because of that
[insurance] you mentioned earlier?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Haha, I
have no idea what you're talking about."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"I heard
a report from one of my men. You secretly have a &lt;duel&gt; with Emma
Licorice to earn a few extra points, no? So, even if you lose here and lose
fifty-three points, you will not be expelled from school. That's your
insurance."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
What would you do then?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"It's
simple. Now that you know my true nature, you need to die here."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina was so
terrified and frustrated that she couldn't even move her fingertips.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">She couldn't
raise her voice to stop Bennett, nor could she lighten her guilt by crying and
screaming.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The only thing
she could do was to let the memories of the month she had spent with Jin
flicker in and out of her mind.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The dried-up
fountain. The conflict out of anger. Her disguise being discovered. The first
time she confided her secret to someone. Becoming accomplices. Days spent in
trickery, concealed from the world.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">And the hint
of tremendous sadness he tried to hide in the lies he told her.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">An electric
current sharply surges through Nina's mind.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Why did I forget something
so important until now?</span></i></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
Haha."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">When Nina
finally came to her senses, her accomplice, who was still lying on the ground,
was smiling slightly.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Nina, I
was not mistaken after all."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Looking up at
the hell that was just around the corner, Jin continued.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"If you
and I work together, we can even fool the world."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">In contrast to
Jin, who began to laugh deep in his throat, Bennett's face was completely
frozen.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">He finally
realized.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">The fire was
already extinguished by Nina, who approached him through his blind spot.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">He realized
that he was the one who had actually been betrayed.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"Wha......"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">As if
everything had been only a faint illusion, the &lt;Executioner of
Immolation&gt; vanished in an instant.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Bennett, whose
gaze wandered as he searched for an answer to this impossible reality, was told
by Jin in a tone of voice that seemed to hold back laughter.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"Misdirection
</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> It is a basic technique of deception. That's what
happens when you're focused only on me."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Before he knew
it, Jin had removed his handcuffs and was standing up, brushing dirt off his
clothes. Little did Bennett know, of course, that Jin could break the handcuffs
with the wire he had hidden in his sleeve.</span></span></p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/bw8.jpg">

<span class="calibre7">"......
Since when?" Bennett asked, desperately gasping for oxygen. "Since
when on earth have you been deceiving me ...... Nina!"</span></span></p>



<span class="calibre7">Bennett, who
was completely enraged, was amusingly vulnerable.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina used the
pickpocketing technique that Jin had previously taught her and snatched the
matchbox that was kept in his pocket.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina felt a
little sorry for Bennett, who was oblivious to such things, so she decided to
give him an answer.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"I'm not
trying to deceive you, Bennet-san. I really thought it was the right thing to
do to get rid of Jin from the school, and I thought the best way to do that was
to cooperate with you. I can assure you that all of my feelings were true and
genuine."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"If
that's the case, then what the hell are you doing now ......?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"When I
saw you tormenting Jin, I realized that I made the wrong decision."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina wore a
sad expression on her face.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"If
things continue as they are, Jin will never be saved. It could be far worse
than having his memories sealed and being expelled from the academy - that's
what I thought, and my body was moving on its own. What do you think? It all
makes sense, doesn't it?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"......
Make sense? I really don't understand. What does it have to do with
anything?"</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"It's
called &lt;Method Acting&gt;, apparently."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina smiled
with perfect social grace.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"To play
a fictional character, I have to abandon my own personality and become someone
else. While acting, my actions, each word choice, and even my thoughts all
follow the initial setting. If someone were to look into my mind, I am
confident that they would not realize that I am acting. ...... Because, I was
genuinely tracing the exact narrative I just told you, of my own
volition."</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"............
That's impossible." </span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"You can
interpret it however you want, but it doesn't change the fact that it happened
right in front of you. You are surrounded by us, robbed of all your matchboxes,
and rendered completely powerless."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina said so
as she pulled a stun gun from a hidden pocket in her skirt.</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">"A truly
elaborate lie is a kind of art. How did you like it, Bennett-san? I hope you
enjoyed it."</span></span></p>

</span></p>

<span class="calibre7">Nina and Jin
crafted elaborate lies for the sole purpose of convincing Bennett of his
victory and stripping him of his focus and attention so that they could steal
the matchbox.</span></span></p>

<span class="calibre7">It all started
that day when they went to town together.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> One week ago </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"There is
one last place I'd like to go."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">After a quick
lunch at a restaurant on the outskirts of town, Jin spoke up.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina was
surprised that Jin would make such a suggestion, but she could not make fun of
it. Because behind his eyes, she could certainly see a kind of resolve.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Fine. Is it close to here?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No, it's
about a two-hour bus ride each way. It will probably be night before we return
to the Heiberg Academy."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina was about
to say, "Then why didn't we go there from the very beginning?", but
she refrained herself.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The reason Jin
had not done so was because he could not make up his mind until the very last
minute whether or not to take her with him.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The place they
were going to was probably that important to him.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Passing
through an ordinary residential area, the bus with the two of them on board
rushed through a peaceful meadow. For some reason, having the two of them alone
in the empty vehicle gave them a strange sense of immorality.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">When the bus
started to climb a long hill, Nina finally opened her mouth.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Speaking
of which, how did you do that lemon trick you were doing earlier?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's
better not to ask how the trick was done. You will be disappointed."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Ehh~,
come on, tell me. This beautiful girl is asking you, you know?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Huh? I
didn't catch that. Can you say it one more time?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Sorry, I got a little carried away."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">He let out a
deliberate sigh and said quietly.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's
just a simple trick. I just slipped the lemon into your bag while you were
distracted by something else."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I know
that. What I want to know is when did you put the lemon in the bag? I was
extremely cautious while watching your magic trick after all."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">In fact, the
distance between Jin and Nina was a little far at that time. He wouldn't be
able to reach her even if he reached out his hand, and since she was holding
the bag under her arm, it would be difficult for him to throw the lemon into
the bag.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">In front of
Nina, who was waiting for an answer, Jin had that mischievous expression on his
face.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"As I
told you before. Once you've planted an assumption in someone's mind, the
deception is 90% successful."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Don't tell me, you put that in there even before the magic was performed?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Correct.
When you were talking to the elderly on the bus on the way to the city,
everything was set in place."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"B-But
that lemon just happened to be at the stall ......."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That
parent and child are only on the street every Thursday afternoon."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Huh?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"They
move their shops from place to place to avoid the attention of the local
Commerce and Trade Association."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No way.
You knew about it beforehand?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That's
right. It was already decided yesterday that I was going to show you that trick."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You're
really ......"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Truly, Jin
might have been born to lie.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The
persistence of elaborate advance preparation for even such a meaningless lie
can only be described as a natural talent.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">".......
I think it's about time. Let's get off at the next one."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Led by Jin,
they arrived at a community cemetery spread out on top of a hill.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">It was not the
same as the high-class cemetery where the ancestors of the Stingray family were
buried. It was overgrown with weeds, and there was a general smell of mustiness
in the air.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">What kind of
people are buried in such a remote place? What did the people buried here mean
to Jin?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The deeper
they went, the worse the condition of the graves became. The headstones growing
out of the ground were all battered, and many of the names and dates of death
were unreadable.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"My
father is buried here."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Didn't
you say earlier that the &lt;White Knights&gt; took him away from you?
......"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin was about
to tell her his true intentions. Nina was sure of it.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Actually,
he was supposed to be dumped at sea, but his business associates stole his body
from the prison and buried it here in this deserted cemetery."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"What do
you mean? Your father is ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"He's a
scammer. Everyone who has lived in this country for more than ten years knows
his name at least."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">When Jin
finally stopped, he looked at a gravestone that was much smaller than the
others around it. It was a gravestone that was not covered with moss or mold,
as though it had been cleaned regularly. A few counterfeit coins with a
slightly strange design were placed next to the headstone.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">A name was
engraved on the headstone, but Nina had no particular idea who it was.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Her butler
read her newspaper every day, so she should have known someone so well-known.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Ah,
that's a fake name. If the police found out, they would dig it up as fast as
they could."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Hey, can
I ask you what his real name is?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Rusty
Yellowkid-Wale. ...... See, you've heard of him, right?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina's eyes
widened and her whole body took in the shock.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Rusty
Yellowkid-Wale.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">He is the name
of a legendary villain who is said to have died of illness in prison three
years ago.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">As Jin said,
there are not many people in this country who do not know that name.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">It is said
that the amount of money he has bilked from wealthy people all over the empire
is well over one billion through credit fraud under the guise of psychic
ability. He never chose any means for his work, nor did he choose whom he would
prey upon. From high-ranking government officials of the time to the biggest
names in the underworld, many people were cheated out of their money by him.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I
thought he was a heinous villain. I never thought he had a child. ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"The
newspapers wrote a lot of bad things about him, after all. ......Well, he was a
bastard, that's for sure."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin smiled,
his eyes narrowing as he reminisced about the old days.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Also,
Rusty isn't my biological parent. I've been living on the streets for as long
as I can remember, and that guy who was just passing by picked me up."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Wait a minute, how did you end up living like that?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Rusty
told me about it years later."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin continued
as he offered a bottle of sake he had bought from a street stall.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"My
parents were wandering around with an astonishing amount of debt. It was enough
to buy five or six small uninhabited islands, isn't that funny? Ordinary people
who lost their jobs to heretics or were driven out of the community by force
had no choice but to quietly wander the streets."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"So you
were abandoned. ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"My
parents were also in debt to the underworld, it seems. I guess they figured it
was better to leave me on the street than let the bad guys catch me and sell me
off to some pervert."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin spoke of
it so easily, but the life he had led was far beyond the scope of Nina's
imagination.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">A tragedy so harsh
that something could have gone fatally wrong, and yet it was located in a place
that was connected to her elegant life in that mansion.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">But Nina knew
nothing of this.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I don't
think this is an appropriate description for a scoundrel who was even called an
&lt;enemy of the people&gt;, ...... but that man was, in essence, a
good-natured person. Most of the money he took from the rich was spent on
savings for my future and donations, and he lived an unbelievably poor life.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">...... Well, I
won't deny that he was not a decent person. Apparently, the only reason he kept
doing his job with no payoff was because he loved to see the reaction of the
people he scammed."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Did you
learn the art of deception from him?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"As I
helped him with his various jobs, it just came naturally."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina could
tell by the look on his face. Jin must have truly trusted the parents who
raised him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Trust.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">That is
probably the most precious thing in this world, and therefore the most
difficult thing to obtain.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I
believe Rusty-san died of illness in prison. ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Ah,
that's obviously not true. That man was as tough as a rock after all. The guys
from the &lt;White Knights&gt;who captured him used their psychic abilities to
torture him repeatedly. It's information I got from an informant inside the
prison, so it's certain."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Torture, you say?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You want
to know what they did to him? You won't be able to eat for three days
though."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Certainly, the
&lt;White Knights&gt; might be the heroes of the country. The reason why the
empire has been able to maintain peace and development for nearly 30 years is
because other countries are afraid of them.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Even so, Nina
knew the true nature of her brothers.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">With an
organization consisting of such cruel people, it was probably true that they
had tortured Rusty to death.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina couldn't
help but confirm it.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"M-My
brothers have been with the &lt;White Knights&gt; for a long time now, so
there's no way ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That's
right. Their names were mentioned in the informant's report."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">So that is how
it was.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina can now
understand the hostility that Jin directed at her when they first met.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Considering
his feelings, perhaps it was natural for him to resent the blood relative of
the person who brutally murdered his father.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I'm
sorry. I don't know anything ......."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's
fine, you're just another victim. I noticed that right away."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina felt sad
when she saw Jin smiling at her teasingly. </span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She was now
convinced.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">His revenge
has no end.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Even if he
achieved his objective, Jin had no intention of continuing his life afterward.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Jin. Are
you really aiming for the top of the academy?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I
certainly said so."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"...... I
don't think that's the case."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">By the time
she realized it, these words were pouring out of her mouth.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Jin,
you're doing it wrong. What is the point of revealing all of your farce in
front of the &lt;White Knights&gt;? That much won't shake the public's trust,
and maybe they'll manipulate the information. Besides, you'd definitely be
killed ......"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">She felt the
barely balanced scales tipping all at once.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If I were to accept Bennett's invitation - if I were
to betray Jin - I would be able to save him from this destructive desire.</span></span></i></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Interrupting
her thoughts, Jin asked.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"What do
you think is a fraudster's most desperate moment?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Don't
change the subject so abruptly."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Come on,
just answer me. It's important."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
When they get caught by the police?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Wrong."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"When
they can't earn any money and are in the red?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Wrong."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin had the
same kind of smile on his face that he had had during the lemon trick.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's
when they realize that there is no one in this world they can trust."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">The wind
blowing through the deserted cemetery took the words away from the two of them.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The time when
no one said anything lasted for a while, and only the sound of the wind became
strangely perceptible.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">In the stopped
world, Jin's eyes looked straight at her.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Deceiving,
betraying, and framing people ...... if you've been in that kind of business
for a long time, you will distrust people, even if you don't want to. When
you're exhausted from everything, I think it's hard to have no one you can
truly trust, without any conflict of interest. Maybe that's why Rusty picked me
up, because he couldn't stand that kind of loneliness anymore."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">A life without
a single person you can truly trust is hell.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">During her
days locked up in a luxurious cage, Nina battled the exact same fears.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Rusty
always said. You only need one person in the world. Find the one person in the
world you can expose all your ugliness, all your shitty past, and still accept
each other.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">When we
revealed our true identities to each other, I thought if there was such a
person, ...... it might be you. We had lived completely opposite lives, but we
shared the same most fatal pain."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin laughed as
he added, "Well, it's all about lies though."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina, of
course, was aware that this was his genuine feeling.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Nina is more
afraid of loneliness than anyone else, and yet she cannot connect with others
in an honest way </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> in that sense, she
and Jin are very much alike.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps I, too, can truly trust him.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How wonderful it is to have at least one ally in this
world.</span></span></i></p><span class="calibre7">To cover up
the heat that was beginning to rise in her cheeks, Nina deliberately laughed
and said, "Liar".</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Therefore, I decided to tell my trusted accomplice, Nina, what my real purpose
is."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Your
real purpose?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I want
to complete the game that Rusty left unfinished."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin went on
with a serious expression on his face, while Nina was completely taken aback by
his unexpected words.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"For more
than two years, my colleagues and I have been trying to find out why Rusty was
killed by the &lt;White Knights&gt;. Then we found out that it was because of
the information that he happened to learn when he was a pawn behind a
high-ranking government official."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"What
kind of information"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"The diary
Rusty was hiding had only fragments of various words in it. I don't have the
whole picture yet. The only thing I can tell you is that the &lt;White
Knights&gt;, the Heiberg Academy that produces their candidates, and the
existence of the psychics that pervade the empire are all full of
deception."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Deception,
you say ......?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"The
empire is using this school to devise some outrageous scheme that will
fundamentally change the way the world works.
To do this, they sent Jill Will Weiser, a senior member of the &lt;White
Knights&gt;, to be the headmaster of the academy, and he has incorporated
memory manipulation into the rules of the academy."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"So your
goal is to uncover this conspiracy? And that would allow Rusty-san's will to be
fulfilled......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"As
expected of an honor student. You catch on pretty fast."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"But
we're just students, you know? How are we going to uncover the conspiracy of
the higher-ups?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"First,
we'll target the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"What's
that?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's a
word from Rusty's diary. The sheep are the students of the Heiberg Academy. If
the shepherd is the headmaster, then the dog means ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You're
saying there's a spy among the students?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That's
right. If anyone tries to get close to the truth of the school, the
&lt;dogs&gt; in each grade are supposed to eliminate them before they can reach
it. And there are two conditions for being a spy. The first is that the student
must come from a family that is closely connected to the government. And the
second one is..."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">By this point,
Nina was getting the gist of what Jin was trying to say.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Overwhelming
ability enough to get rid of anyone who gets in the way ....... Don't tell me,
Bennett is..."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"He's one
of the suspects. That's why I targeted him first."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Eh, you
targeted him? It wasn't a coincidence that he caught your attention?".</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina.
Who found the brooch you wear on your uniform?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Brooch?
What on earth are you talking about? ... ah!"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">The moment she
realized the truth, Nina's breathing stopped for a moment.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She couldn't
believe that everything was Jin's scheme from the very beginning.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">In the first
place, Nina became deeply involved with Bennett after he came to the dorm to
deliver her a brooch that had been lost.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She had her
doubts. Even though she had changed her clothes in a hurry to fool Rudy-sensei,
would she make the mistake of accidentally dropping such a luxurious item?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Looking back
on it now, it would be more natural to assume that Jin secretly retrieved it
and dropped it where Bennett was going.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">This would
explain why Bennett was in the classroom when Jin and Nina had their
&lt;duel&gt;. It was probably because Jin had passed on the information to the
fifth class where Bennett belonged.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Bennett's
desire to get his hands on Nina and his decision to get rid of Jin, who had
gotten in the way, were all in accordance with the script that Jin had written.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Are you
out of your mind? Are you really going to turn the academy - no, the empire -
against us ......?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">If he was just
being reckless with his sense of justice, Nina would surely have stopped him.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">But Jin was
laughing as innocently as a child in front of a new toy. It was the look of a
true fraudster who truly welcomes the thrill of excitement.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">His motive is
not only revenge.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">He is truly
enjoying the last great task left unfinished by the parent who raised him, a
game in which the fate of the world is at stake.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina,
there is still a way back for you. It might be safer to pretend that everything
you just heard never happened and go back to your normal life."</span></span></p></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was too late to offer me a way out now.</span></span></i></p><span class="calibre7">It seemed that
Nina had been badly influenced by the days she had spent with her accomplice.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Despite the
fact that they were talking about such a horrifying plan, she couldn't shake
off the elation in her chest.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Let me
in on the game. If my family is involved in some horrible conspiracy, I have an
obligation to find out. Besides, ......."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina said with
a sinister smile on her face.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Don't
you dare leave me out of such a fun game."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Alright, it's decided then," Jin said so while welcoming her determination,
he spread his hands wide and laughed. "Let's fool the world
together."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">After a moment
of silence, they looked at each other and smiled.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Now they were
officially accomplices.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Now,
let's get down to the point, shall we?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin spoke up
with his usual fearless smile as he made his outrageous request.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I'll
tell you the plan for hunting our first target ...... Bennett Lohr."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin had given
her the most impossible task to date.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">First, Jin
would deliberately lose to Bennett in the &lt;Chase Tag&gt;. This would make
Bennett realize that Jin was an insignificant opponent, and he would move even
closer to Nina.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">When Jin asked
for another &lt;duel&gt;, Bennett would probably request Nina's cooperation.
That type of person always focuses on completely destroying their opponents, so
they will probably create a desperate situation in which Nina betrays them
right in front of their eyes.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">From that
point on, it would be Nina's task.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She would act
as if she had completely betrayed Jin, only to snatch the matchbox from Bennett
at the moment when he was most vulnerable.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The most
crucial part is to use the layout of the pitfalls to make Bennett think that he
has [seen through Jin's plan] and not let him realize what he is really after.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Of course,
Bennett, who has lived his life as a dominator, is an unusually skeptical
person. To deceive such a person, a half-hearted performance is far from
enough.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">They must be
prepared to deceive even the world.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Do you
think we can do it?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Of
course. Who do you think I am?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">There is only
one way out of this situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Method acting </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> a technique that has not yet been fully systematized
in the theater world, but Nina is perfectly capable of utilizing it.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">It is the same
as when she has been impersonating a female student named Kate and manipulating
her.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She thoroughly
imagines all the information about the fictional character's personality,
relationships, past events, beliefs, etc., and melds herself into the role. By
cultivating the image overnight, Nina is able to do this with near self-brainwashing
precision.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Thus, this
time, Nina should portray this character :</span></span></p></span></p><p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">·<span class="calibre42">
</span></span><b class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">She believes that the
best way to save Jin from destruction is to expel him from the school.</span></b></span></p><p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">·<span class="calibre42">
</span></span><b class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">To do so, she decides
to team up with Bennett. She also believes him to be a good person.</span></b></span></p><p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">·<span class="calibre42">
</span></span><b class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">On the day of the
duel, she witnesses Bennett's madness and begins to regret her betrayal.</span></b></span></p><p class="msolistparagraphcxspfirst1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">·<span class="calibre42">
</span></span><b class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">She comes to the
conclusion that the only way to save Jin is to defeat Bennett.</span></b></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina was
determined that she could do it.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She believed
that she could fool the world, even herself, and pull off this most difficult
task.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina, I
have one last golden rule for you. Rusty used to say this when he was
drunk."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">With the sky
turning orange in the background, the fraudster who had turned the world
against him grinned viciously.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"A truly
elaborate lie is a kind of art."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Art - Nina
traced this word in her mouth.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She had never
thought of lying as a beautiful thing.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She had always
thought of it as a lowly means of clinging to the world because she was not
born with ability and was weak.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">However, if
she could really lie enough to deceive the world.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">In a world
that was gradually approaching night, Nina felt her vision open up all at once.</span></span></p></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">By the time
they arrived back at the school, it was completely nighttime, but by then Nina
had already forgotten about the events at the deserted cemetery and was
thinking only of betraying Jin.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">That was all
she really thought about.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
You're like a monster, aren't you? Nina."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Are you
really saying such a thing to me?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">She quickly
responded with sarcasm, and Bennett laughed.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">All she had to
do was to press this stun gun to his neck and he would pass out.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">That would be
enough to knock Bennett unconscious and leave him with the fatal weakness of
having been defeated by a bottom-ranked student. Now all that remains is to
find a secluded place where they can find out for sure if he really is the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina felt sure
of their power.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">They could
defeat a monster like Bennett by just lying and acting, even without any special
abilities.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Perhaps they
really could win the game that Rusty had left unfinished.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"But
...... that's strange."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Bennett
muttered in a terribly low voice. He still seemed to be looking for a way out.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina,
why are you going through all this trouble?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Don't be
a sore loser. Just give up already."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">If the other
party is going to fight with words, it's Jin's role to accept the challenge.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina
also has a conscience that she can't bear to dismember and kill you. Or would
you prefer to be twisted to death by psychokinesis instead of a stun gun?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No,
that's not what I'm talking about. If Nina wanted to betray me from the
beginning, she should not need to go through all this trouble. It would be
easier to challenge me to a &lt;duel&gt; head-on and win more points. Even if
you were to defeat me here, she would only get fifty-three points, which would
be of no benefit to Nina."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Not
really. This defeat is going to make you completely untrustworthy. And of
course, that stupid tournament will also be over. All is well."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"... I
see, looks like I can't win an argument against you."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">The game was
now over.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina decided
so and put the stun gun close to Bennett's neck, which was hanging down.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Then she
finally noticed something was wrong.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Bennett was
not hanging his head in despair. He was lying face down so that she would not
be able to read his expression.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Bennett is desperately
trying to hold back his laughter.</span></i></span></p><span class="calibre7">His trembling
body confirmed this hunch.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I have
one last thing to say, may I?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No,
rejected. Nina, hurry up and use the stun gun ......."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Jin, you
better watch your back after all."</span></span></p></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">...... No way.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Lies, it can't be true.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The matchboxes were all confiscated, and Bennett
showed no sign of acting strangely.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Then why was the &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt;
approaching from behind?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And why was Jin being held by a reddish-orange burning
arm on his shoulder?</span></span></i></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Damn
it!"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin, who had
dived to the ground as quickly as possible, was barely able to avoid being
engulfed by the flames.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Even so, the
intense pain of his body being burned must have relentlessly assaulted Jin.
Nina could not even imagine how much pain he was in right now.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Bennett!
Don't tell me, you..."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">The part of
the clothing that was touched by the fire puppet was completely scorched, and
the skin that could be seen behind it was burnt.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">So this is not
an illusion that only brings pain.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Bennett is
really trying to burn Jin to death.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
Why?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin's
expression was blank, as though he was in a daze.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Why are
you able to activate your psychic ability? This kind of development wasn't part
of the script ......"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Bennett kept a
gentle smile on his face and instead of replying, he called another puppet in
front of him.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Next to it, a
fireball the size of a human head was further generated.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No, no,
...... It's a lie, right?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">The fireball
grew, changed shape, and eventually transformed into a puppet.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina had long
forgotten about her acting and collapsed to her knees.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">This is a foul play.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">He didn't even
need to light a match or make a preliminary move to activate his ability.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">He was able to
control three of these terrifying monsters at the same time.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina,
your acting was certainly perfect. I was completely fooled. I even thought you
were in love with me. ...... But unfortunately, you guys miscalculated on one
thing."</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">The flickering
flames made it impossible to see Bennett's expression.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I've
never trusted anyone from the very beginning. Lighting a match is a
prerequisite for activation? Only one [Executioner of Immolation&gt; can be
activated? Why did you guys keep believing those lies?"</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">Bennett
snapped his fingers.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">With that as a
signal, all three monsters come running toward them at once.</span></span></p></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I hope
you don't put up any resistance so you can burn to death as fast as you
can!"</span></span></p>
