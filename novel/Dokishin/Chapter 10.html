<h3>Epilogue</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The news that Bennett
Lohr had been expelled from the school after losing a &lt;duel&gt; quickly
spread throughout the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fact that he
committed violent atrocities in what he called "C-rank hunting" and
that he was detained by the police because of suspicions of criminal acts in
the past were spread with various exaggerations and dramatizations.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What surprised the
students the most, however, was the statement that the Heiberg Academy sent to
various newspapers in response to the incident.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><br class="sc-5rbuj" /></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">The school recognizes that the incident involving
Bennett Lohr was the result of a legitimate competition based on the rules
agreed upon by the students. While it is true that the students are being
detained because of past criminal activity, the school has no control over what
the students did prior to enrolling at the school. In addition, Bennett Lohr
has already been expelled from the school with his memory sealed, so it would
be extremely regrettable if the school were to be held responsible for his
actions.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">There are some who say that the memory-sealing
measures implemented by Principal Jill Will Weiser's psychic abilities have
encouraged students to commit crimes, but we believe that there is absolutely
no basis for such claims.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">In the first place, the school is a training institute
to produce excellent candidates for the &lt;White Knights&gt;, and at the same
time, it is a place of competition for the limited number of seats available.
The sealing of memories is not only a measure to prevent information leaks, but
also a compassionate measure so that students who lose in the competition will
not suffer emotional trauma for the rest of their lives.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Besides, the five former students who were expelled
from the school as a result of the &lt;duel&gt; against Bennett Lohr are now
almost all recovered with no after-effects that should be noted.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Therefore, we will not yield to any criticism from the
government, the judiciary, or the newspapers.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8"><i class="calibre25">　</i></span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"><i class="calibre25">We declare that we will continue to encourage
&lt;duel&gt; and to seal the memories of those who have dropped out of the
school.</i></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><br class="sc-5rbuj" /></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">All students
understood the true nature of the school after reading this statement, which
was also posted on the information board in the classroom building at the
beginning of the week.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In fact, the day after
the statement was posted, four students voluntarily withdrew from the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In an abnormal world
where even a monster like Bennett is accepted, no one blames them for giving up
on their potential and leaving early.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps this trend
will accelerate further in the future.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps it is Nina
Stingray who is most perplexed by the increasingly chaotic state of the school.
It is because she and her accomplice, Jin, were the ones who led Bennett into
the trap that resulted in all this chaos.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nevertheless, some
things have turned out for the better.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her classmates began
to look at her with more respect compared to the uncontrollable monster they
once feared her to be. She is being talked to more and more often, and she
feels a little more comfortable in the classroom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, who is regarded
as having saved the C-rank students altogether, was surrounded by boys at the
front of the classroom in the morning. Jin, who is being bombarded with
questions from his curious classmates, looks unusually flustered.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she watched this
scene with a smile on her face, Emma Licorice spoke to Nina with a sparkle in
her eyes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're amazing,
Nina-chan. Looks like you've already become our savior."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma sat down next to
her, her orange-colored hair fluttering as she laughed lightly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although Nina felt
guilty that their victory was based on a lie, she couldn't let it show on her
face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina spun the answer
she had prepared in advance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, that's not
true. It was only possible because of Emma-san's cooperation."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh~? I was just
handing out envelopes without really knowing what I was doing though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Everything was
possible because Emma-san is loved by everyone. On the contrary, I-......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You should be
more proud of yourself, Nina-chan. There are a lot of people who were saved by
you!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Feeling embarrassed,
Nina involuntarily lowered her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Nina thought
about it, she felt that Emma had been treating her with an attitude that had
not changed since she first enrolled at the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When did I
start to doubt people's good intentions?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When did I
become wary of people's good intentions instead of appreciative of them?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What fraudsters truly
despair of is when they realize that there is no one in this world whom they
can trust. Those were the words that Jin told her before.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina thought that she
might be able to change from now on.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Instead of enduring
the encroaching despair alone, she might finally have the strength to face it
with someone she could trust with all her heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Emma-san, will
you ...... be my friend from now on?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For the first time,
Nina was able to speak out her true feelings in this classroom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ahaha, what are
you saying all of a sudden? We are already friends, aren't we?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I see, that's
right. Thank you ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It might be a fleeting
thing that will eventually be erased from either of their memories.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, Nina wanted
to cherish this relationship.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After the last class
of the day, Nina made her way to the deserted fountain as usual.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, who was sitting
on the bench, raised his face from the book he was reading.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's the
matter, Nina? You don't look so good. Is it food poisoning?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What else could
it be if not mental exhaustion? All this attention is making me feel like I
have a pit in my stomach. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I think you can
relieve it by pressing the acupressure points on the top of your head and under
your chin with both hands at the same time. I've heard it's even more effective
if you do it with your feet shoulder-width apart and with your hips
lowered."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, let me try
....... -wait, doesn't that sound like a really dumb pose?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Try it. It'll
make all your worries seem ridiculous."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I think another
serious problem might arise if I try it here......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin was still a wicked
liar, spouting out information that was not known whether it was true or false.
Nevertheless, Nina had to continue to be his accomplice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So she was going to
confirm that thing one last time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin, I can't
believe you are also a psychic."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hmm?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Could it be that
I'm the only one who is really just an ordinary person?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although she felt a
little lonely, Nina was actually not that angry.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She knew that Jin's
way of deceiving even his allies in order to achieve his goal, and moreover, he
could not defeat Bennett otherwise.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the cobblestone
pavement, where no one else was around besides the two of them, Jin answered in
a hushed voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~, it's all a
lie. It was just a trick."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............Huuh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If I could use
such a ridiculous power to nullify other's psychic abilities, I'd have a much
better life."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"B-But how in the
world?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin showed his
signature mischievous grin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Bennett's
psychic ability to create an inexhaustible fire monster was not invincible.
There was a real condition for activating it, apart from lighting the
match."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What was
that?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There have been a
lot of hints dropped over the past month, you know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin began to explain
everything with ease.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"For example,
Bennett was extremely averse to other students entering his room in the
dormitory. For example, Bennett's C-rank hunts were always held in tree-lined
areas not far from the dormitories. And whenever a &lt;practical exam&gt; was
held in the gymnasium, which was quite a distance from the dormitories, one of
the private restrooms nearby was always occupied."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Hmm? I
don't understand what you're trying to say."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"One thing can be
deduced from those hints."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin raised his index
finger and continued.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Bennett's
&lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt; can only be activated if some sort of
preparation is made in his room beforehand. In order to activate it away from
the dormitory, he would have to use a place where no one could find it instead.
A private bathroom would be the perfect place for that."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Is that
why you realized that the activation condition wasn't about matches?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Actually, during
the second &lt;chase tag&gt;, I investigated from the adjacent private
bathroom, and there was no sign of anyone there at all. After Bennett had made
some preparations in that room, he tampered with the lock so that it could not
be opened from the outside. He then proceeded to the meeting place with a
nonchalant look on his face."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Who would have
thought..."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course,
that's not the only clue. Bennett's grandfather was a wealthy man who had made
his way up from being a humble candlemaker."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Candlemaker
......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If we consider
that psychic abilities can be influenced by one's upbringing and traumas, we
can assume that the real condition for activation of the &lt;Executioner of
Immolation&gt; is [having a candle lit by oneself nearby.] The reason why the
place for the duel is always the tree-lined area is probably to avoid being too
far away from the dormitory where the candles are located."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But that's just
a guess, right? It's dangerous to go into a duel with only that
information."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Do you think I,
a skeptical man, didn't verify it thoroughly?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's eyes, which were
the same color as the night, flashed with a mysterious glint.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The second time
I faced Bennett in the &lt;Chase Tag&gt;, I pulled a scam on him. Nina, do you
remember that time when you told Bennett that the matchboxes had been replaced?
Actually, that was a trap in and of itself."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've heard that
before. That was a deliberate attempt to catch Bennett off guard by making him
see through your scheme, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's merely
the cover, Nina. A good lie will always have two or three layers of
trickery."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Forgetting to take a
breath, she found herself waiting for Jin's next words.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A truly elaborate lie
is a kind of art,</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> Nina secretly
recalled the words he had told her on one occasion.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I didn't
actually replace his matchbox at that time. I reached into my pocket so Bennett
would notice, but in reality, I just put the matchbox back in its place once I
pulled it out."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina began to see the
full extent of the trap that Jin had set.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had spent her days
as his accomplice, and she had acquired the mindset of a liar.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I didn't do
anything to the matchbox at all. And yet Bennett said some pretty crazy things.
He said things like, [Before this game started, I replaced the box with a spare
one], [While I was in the bathroom, I was testing it first], [Sure enough, when
I lit the match you replaced it with, it didn't trigger my ability], and so
on."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So that's how
you became convinced that the activation condition was a complete lie."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yes, that was
really a careless statement on his part. If the condition was really to light
the match, there is no way that his psychic ability would not be
activated."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's mouth contorted
into a vicious smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">The fraud is 90% successful once you have planted an
assumption in the other person's mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina remembered the
line Jin spoke when he showed her the lemon trick.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just as the lemon had
long been planted in her bag by the time she was heading into town on the bus
that day, all the preparations had been completed long before he confronted
Bennett.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if Bennett had
been alerted to Jin's scheme after the fight had begun, it was all too late.
Jin was fighting a completely different board from the very beginning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The rest was
easy. On the day of the &lt;duel&gt;, I saw Bennett leave the dormitory, so I
snuck into his room and took a candle from there. I put it on a table in the
corner of the entrance and tied a string around it. Of course, I had a bucket
of water right under it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I see. When the
string was pulled, the candle would fall into the bucket and the fire would be
extinguished, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Exactly. With
that many people gathered, no one would notice the thin string lying on the
floor. It's a pretty simple trick, isn't it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He reads his
opponent's aims and weaknesses from trivial information, weaves together a
number of tricks to steer his opponent's thinking, and makes sure that he pulls
off the final move.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The opponent does not
know where Jin's true aim lies, or on which side of the board he has been
deceived.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This is precisely what
makes Jin's skill as a fraudster so amazing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He has truly defeated
a monster with power beyond human understanding with only lies and deception.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......You really
have fooled the world."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's all thanks
to you, Nina. Without your extraordinary acting ability, this plan would not
have been possible."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The two looked at each
other and laughed in the most genuine way possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I've turned into an
outrageously villainous person, huh, Nina thought.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After deceiving so
many people and putting one student, albeit an evil one, through hell, she
laughed happily like this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Your smile looks
kind of wicked, you know. Nina, have you finally understood the charm of
lying?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, at least,
I'm beginning to look forward to your next grand scheme."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">An insane game of
uncovering the lies that the Heiberg Academy, the &lt;White Knights&gt;, and
this empire have been covering up. A task of the highest difficulty that even a
legendary fraudster once failed to complete.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If it had been the
previous her who was waiting in the mansion for her end to come, she would have
definitely turned away from it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And yet, now, Nina's
heart is filled with passionate emotions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But you see. If
anyone finds out that the Stingray family's young lady is trying to pick a
fight with the empire ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's okay as
long as no one finds out about it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, you know
damn well."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Besides,
elaborate lies are like an art, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ha~, I guess
you're a villain, too, after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A world where
psychics are so prevalent is not a sane world, anyway.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since that is
the case, it's okay to have an existence like us every once in a while.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">We are like
poisons that fight against a great evil with malice and deceit.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"At first, it was
only a stroke of luck that led us to become an accomplice."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the spring breeze
that blew through the air, Jin muttered with a serious expression on his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If I were to
take advantage of your bad reputation throughout the school, it would make
things a lot easier for me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Yeah."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But you were
different from all the other heretics I've seen in my life. You're a normal,
good person. The same goes for Emma, the two who put their bodies on the line
to get the evidence, and the 21 students who helped us out the other day. I
didn't want to make them into something that I could just exploit for my own
purposes. So, you know ...... I would like to express my gratitude."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... What? Is
your head alright? It's unbelievable that someone like you would say something
like that."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Of course
that's a lie."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's sense of
mischief was stimulated when she saw Jin scratching his head in embarrassment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Could you say it
again? I couldn't quite hear you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I have a disease
where I can't say the same thing twice. Do you want me to have a seizure and
collapse?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't lie. Come
on!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I,
re-fu-se!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina laughed heartily
at Jin, who seriously disliked the idea.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She is no longer
alone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She now has an
accomplice who is willing to deceive the world with her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She now has someone
she can truly trust, someone who has her back and who will stand up to the
darkness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Isn't it about
time we ended this idle chatter?" Jin nonchalantly said so, as if to cover
up his embarrassment of doing something he was not accustomed to. "I'll
tell you about our next plan."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina nodded with a
serious expression, but thought Jin's poor acting was amusing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just the fact that he
had come to reveal such a clumsy expression was enough to make her feel
positive about the past month's battle.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The sun was almost
setting, and a beautiful gradation of orange and purple was dyeing the world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She will probably
never forget this moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A beautiful scene,
almost like a fake, was spread out before the two of them as they were about to
deceive a world filled with illusions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This seems like a
well-crafted lie.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, before we
get down to business, can I tell you one thing?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh, what is
it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thank you,
Jin."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Under the sky, which
was so beautiful that it looked like a lie, Nina sensed that a new secret had
sprouted inside her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Fortunately, she was
confident in her acting skills.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I must
definitely hide the feelings that have just sprouted inside me.</span></span></i></p>
