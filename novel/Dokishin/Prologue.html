<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m dissatisfied with my current life.<br />
For example, no matter how diligent I work, my salary doesn’t rise.<br />
Another example, I&#8217;m dissatisfied with current politics but I can&#8217;t change it.<br />
Yet another example, my life lacks stimulation and thrill.</p>
<p>There is a feeling of obstruction that cannot be expressed in words.<br />
For example, there is no hope for the future outlook.<br />
Another example, there is no hope for the future of the country in which I live.<br />
Yet another example, I don&#8217;t have free time because most of it is spent working.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I also think this.</p>
<p>Am I really doing my best?</>
Can I really do anything myself?<br />
Will something happen if I really try?</p>
<p>But, I don&#8217;t like spicy food.<br />
But, I don&#8217;t want to get tired.<br />
But, I don&#8217;t like the annoying smell.</p>
<p>Everyone doesn&#8217;t like that.<br />
I hate it too.<br />
That&#8217;s why I run away to games, light novels, and the internet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the strongest in the game. Master of all kinds of weapons and wielding mighty power.<br />
I can be a Hero who destroys evil, or a villain who does his best to be outrageous.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m a coward at roots, so I&#8217;m definitely a good guy.</p>

<p>Nowadays, there are many games with a high degree of freedom, where I have the right to kill and kill the characters that appear in the games.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pleasure to spend time freely in a world that suits me.<br />
It&#8217;s a pleasure to devour a light novel&#8217;s 『convenient plot』.</p>
<p>Immersing myself in the joy of being in tune with the Hero who is strangely popular with girls.<br />
Having the pleasure to tease a beautiful girl while thinking &#8220;Hey yo hahaha&#8221; or &#8220;Easy hahaha&#8221; in my heart.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is a recent trend, it seems that the main character’s TUEEEEE is often added with a harem element.<br />
Innocent schoolgirl, tsundere, older sister, younger sister, sister-in-law, and even real sisters are the rage these days.<br />
Also loli grannies, elves, beastmen, even non-humans.</p>
<p>My strike zone is as wide as the number of worldly desires.</p>

<p>The internet is full of friends who are &#8220;dissatisfied with their current life&#8221; like myself.<br />
In a strange sense of solidarity, it feels good to spill my dissatisfaction in the world with these anons.</p>
<p>Other than that, the internet is full of entertainment.<br />
I could just consume the contents created by someone who doesn&#8217;t even know your face.<br />
After enjoying one content, up to the next.<br />
After having fun, on to the next fun time.<br />
I don&#8217;t care about the efforts of the person who created the content.<br />
As a consumer, I just devour content.</p>
<p>But is this really all right?</p>
<p>I squeezed that inner voice deep into the corner of my heart and kept it shut.</p>
<p>Because I don&#8217;t want to be spicy, tired, or annoyed.</p>

<p>And I suddenly said something like this.</p>

<p>[Ah &#8230;I wonder how it feels like to become a resident of a fantasy world like in the game. Not the average person, but the main character in Very Easy Mode. ]</p>
<p>Has anyone thought about it once?<br />
Whenever I play such a game, it&#8217;s usually in hard mode.<br />
But, when it comes to actually going there in person, Very Easy mode would be more preferable.</p>

<p>And there was a voice responding to me.</p>
<p>『Then let’s give it a try.』</p>
