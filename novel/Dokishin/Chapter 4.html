<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>[Have you calmed down?]</p>
<p>[Yes, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;]</p>
<p>The girl was ironically shrinking now.<br />
The atmosphere was uncomfortable at the training ground, so for the time being I moved to the tavern attached to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild.<br />
The earlier outspoken girl was completely timid while drinking fruit juice (my treat).</p>
<p>[So what do you mean by that? Calm down and tell me your story.]</p>
<p>[Well, I just became a fledgling adventurer recently. I&#8217;m afraid to go out and fight monsters by myself, so I thought I&#8217;d have to join a party somewhere&#8230;]</p>
<p>It seems that the girl was choosing words with difficulty.<br />
Well, I understand somehow.</p>
<p>[It doesn&#8217;t work that way]</p>
<p>[Yes&#8230; there were people who allowed me to join them.]</p>
<p>[I bet they were trying to scam you. Rob you, or something even worse]</p>
<p>[Eh, well, at least I escaped intact.]</p>
<p>She said so in my words and sighed.<br />
Well, she looked pretty cute. One, two or three might see her as an easy prey to satisfy their thirst.<br />
She seemed weak, and once they left town, all rules didn&#8217;t matter.<br />
Because she was an adventurer, she might have a means of resistance, but who knows what would happen if more men were piling up on her.</p>
<p>[So, why does it have to be me? I&#8217;m glad you invited me, but I&#8217;m also a man. And probably one of the devilish types as well.]</p>

<p>I mean, this kid was often safe until now.<br />
What if she’s the type of girl that runs away once she gets what she wants?</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s okay! I&#8217;m sick of that! And people who really try to do that don&#8217;t say that.]</p>
<p>And the person in question was in such a condition.</p>
<p>[Oh yeah, thank you for your trust, but I can&#8217;t trust you.]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hopeful and appropriate to increase the number of &#8220;humans here&#8221;, but the story was too good to be true, isn&#8217;t it? What is this, an eroge? It seemed to develop into that kind of plot.<br />
Ah, she was upset now. Maybe I should really lend her a helping hand.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s okay to trust that girl. I&#8217;ll guarantee it.]</p>
<p>It was Woz, the old man at the reception, who sent out the rescue boat. I wonder if his shift was already over today, but he sat on the same counter side as us and ordered ale. Is it okay to trust her since the guild staff guarantees it?</p>
<p>[Sure, but why does it have to be me? I want an explanation here.]</p>
<p>[Well, your sword and staff arts were amazing, and you can use magic, right? I was watching the simulated battle in the daytime, but it was amazing to have a meeting with someone like a C-ranked person. Normally, if a fledgling adventurer like this interacted with a C-ranked person, it&#8217;s an instant no-go.]</p>
<p>Oh really?<br />
I asked old man Woz with an eye gesture, and he nodded in confirmation.</p>
<p>[Although you can use magic, you wouldn&#8217;t normally have ten seconds. It&#8217;s rare to have a dexterous guy like you who does both swords and magic. I think there are many guys who would want you in their party.] Oh really. It&#8217;s still level 2, but at this point is it already out of the ordinary? This may cause trouble if it gets too powerful. [Okay, I&#8217;m just skeptical. I&#8217;m a redneck and I don&#8217;t know much about common sense and things, so I was a little nervous. I&#8217;m Taichi, nice to meet you.]</p>
<p>With that said, the girl held up her hand back with a big smile.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m Marl, nice to meet you!]</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine. It feels good to see.<br />
After seeing the situation settled, old man Woz moved to another table. This old man really can read the air.</p>
<p>[By the way, where is the inn Taichi-san staying in? I have a room in an inn near the guild.]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s the Scorching Anvil Pavilion near the central square. Old man Woz’ recommendation. 2 large bronze coins and 5 bronze coins per night with breakfast. Three bronze coins, bread, a dish, and soup came with a bonus. The volume and taste are at a satisfactory level for me. ]</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>[Mmm, the accommodation cost is higher than the inn I&#8217;m taking, but the food conditions may be better&#8230; How was the room?]</p>
<p>[The room is clean and the sheets are clean. The doors can be locked, and the size is just right.]</p>
<p>[Hmm, I wonder if I&#8217;ll stay there from tomorrow. Can you help me reserve a room?]</p>
<p>[Alright, I’ll help you. What are your plans for tomorrow? I was thinking of buying small household items in the morning and then making a request in the guild.]</p>
<p>[If you like, I&#8217;ll go shopping with you, and I can show you around various shops.]</p>
<p>[Well, then I&#8217;ll happily take your words. To be honest, I&#8217;m still worried about walking alone.]</p>
<p>[With an arm like Taichi-san’s, you could just instantly kill any robber coming after you.]</p>
<p>[Don&#8217;t praise me too much, I can feel the hurdles rising.]</p>
<p>It made me feel embarrassed when she looked at me with glittering eyes that were a mixture of admiration and respect.<br />
In the first place, this ability itself was like a so-called cheat.<br />
I must do my best to be suitable for my ability.</p>
<p>[What are you going to do today?]</p>
<p>[Hmm, the day will soon fall? I&#8217;m thinking of taking a rest since I’ve had my share of sweats a little more today. Right, isn&#8217;t there a public bath or such facility around here?]</p>
<p>By the way, I recalled that there was no bath in the inn.</p>
<p>[There are some, but it feels like it&#8217;s only for rich people in the North District. Even if an adventurer like us went there, we would still need to pay in advance.]</p>
<p>[That’s unfortunate, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>
<p>[But, there is a bathing area behind the guild training ground. Adventurers often washed their sweat away there.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>[I see, I wonder if I&#8217;ll buy just a towel or change of underwear from now on.]</p>
<p>[Menial items for adventurers are also sold at the guild counter.]</p>
<p>Seriously, what a convenient adventurer&#8217;s guild.<br />
I immediately went to buy cheap towels, underwear, soap, etc. at the guild counter.<br />
They were 3 large bronze coins in total. Soap was expensive.</p>
<p>Then I headed to the training ground again and trained.<br />
This time it&#8217;s sword training.<br />
If an enemy got inside the quarterstaff&#8217;s space, I would have to fight with a sword.<br />
Quarterstaff would also be difficult to use in a confined space such as inside a cave.</p>
<p>[Marl, what kind of weapon do you use?]</p>
<p>I asked Marl, who was watching me train on the side.<br />
Marl was awkwardly staring at me with a swimming gaze.</p>
<p>[Um, sword?]</p>
<p>[Why do you sound unsure&#8230; get a wooden sword for the time being and let me see how good you are at it.]</p>
<p>Oh, I have a very bad feeling.<br />
Marl, who brought a wooden sword, held the sword at me.<br />
The waist was tight. She’s certainly not a total noob.</p>
<p>[Try attacking me now]</p>
<p>[Yes! Taaaaaah!]</p>
<p>Her feet were faster than I expected.<br />
However, she didn’t seem to be comfortable swinging the sword. Therefore, her sword speed was noticeably slow.<br />
I avoided it and lightly hit her shoulder with my wooden sword.</p>
<p>[Ahh]</p>
<p>[You are leaning too far forward. Come on, once more.]</p>
<p>[Uu, ya]</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>This time, she thrusts in and swings the wooden sword messily.<br />
I&#8217;m closing my eyes. Avoiding sideways while tripping her legs at the same time.</p>
<p>She fell down.</p>
<p>[&#8230; Then, let’s forget what we talked about earlier.]</p>
<p>[Please wait! Don&#8217;t abandon me!]</p>
<p>Marl threw away the wooden sword and clung to my leg.<br />
It&#8217;s painful to say this to a girl who is snarling with tears, but it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>
<p>[You can&#8217;t even afford to walk on your own feet. Give up on adventuring, go home and live normally.]</p>
<p>[Uwaaa! That&#8217;s terrible! How could you throw me away even though you&#8217;ve been so kind!]</p>
<p>And the training ground was upset.<br />
One person whispered to the other with a suspecting gaze despite most likely not knowing the situation.<br />
Another one gave an impression that he’s looking at garbage when glancing at me.<br />
And yet another one looked at Marl&#8217;s appearance and turned his murderous gaze at me from behind.</p>
<p>This was such a headache.</p>
<p>While clenching my back teeth, I desperately endured the urge to drive my clenched fist down Marl&#8217;s brain with the self-control of steel.<br />
I grabbed Marl&#8217;s by the neck and made her stand up.<br />
Marl&#8217;s height was about 150 cm. She’s about one head shorter than me, who was at least 175 cm.</p>
<p>[Well, Marl, I can use swords, polearms, and magic. I&#8217;ve just started as an adventurer today, but I&#8217;m going to use it for my livelihood. Inevitably, I&#8217;ll face danger head-on. Do you understand? ]</p>
<p>Marl nodded with tears.<br />
Kuh, mental attack. That’s dirty, Marl. Dirty.</p>
<p>[Can you protect yourself then? I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not strong enough to carry someone who can&#8217;t protect themselves.]</p>
<p>[T, that&#8217;s&#8230;]</p>
<p>[And you should be on an equal footing as long as you&#8217;re in a duo. What can you offer me if I provide you with safety?]</p>
<p>[I, I’ll carry your luggage]</p>
<p>I put the quarterstaff to my inventory in front of Marl and took my adventurer set out.<br />
Then, I stashed the adventurer set into my inventory again.<br />
Some of the adventurers who saw the situation raised a voice of admiration, but it was not the case.</p>
<p>[As you can see, I can use the treasure box. I don&#8217;t need anyone to carry my luggage.]</p>
<p>[Then, I’ll do the chores for you.]</p>
<p>[Do you think it is appropriate to have the monster subjugation rewards divided evenly between us just by you doing chores for me?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>Marl slumped and fell silent at my words.<br />
Perhaps I guessed the general situation through this exchange, the number of piercing eyes and suspecting eyes was reduced.<br />
It may be that my claim was correct.</p>
<p>[Then&#8230;]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>I ask Marl muttering, sledding.<br />
Thinking about it later, it would have been better if I didn&#8217;t listen back at this point and just dismissed her.<br />
Marl made a fist and looked up at my face.</p>
<p>[In return for Taichi-san&#8217;s provision of safety to me, I will provide all of myself to Taichi-san!]</p>
<p>I could see senior adventurers started passing wooden swords around.<br />
Good grief, this girl.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>Thirty minutes after the shocking remark, I left my head at the guild counter and prostrated.<br />
No matter what.<br />
No matter what.</p>
<p>[Ku, Kuku&#8230; Dahahahaha! It was a disaster!]</p>
<p>Old man Woz banged my back while laughing hard.<br />
This daddy will definitely make you cry someday.<br />
Marl, the cause behind all this, was going to her inn near the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild.<br />
It seems that she’s withdrawing her reservation immediately and will stay at the same inn as me.<br />
Me? I had to deal with the tough love of the smiling male adventurers after Marl left.</p>
<p>[Well, now it seems you’ve made a name for yourself. Having a treasure box brings a lot of attention, right?]</p>
<p>[Although it comes with all that excess baggage.]</p>
<p>[You say she’s going to hinder you, but that girl is excellent, isn&#8217;t she?]</p>
<p>[Is it possible for her to handle a sword properly? Can she use magic?]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there was such a pretense.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>[That lass is still young, but she packs a lot of knowledge and problem-solving ability.]</p>
<p>I see.<br />
So her information gathering and direction searching were excellent, just not suitable for rough encounters.</p>
<p>[Sorry I made you wait!]</p>
<p>Bang! Marl appeared by opening the door of the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild vigorously.<br />
Ah, yeah, she looked fine.</p>
<p>[Let&#8217;s go now, my luggage is heavy.]</p>
<p>I stood up obediently as requested and took over Marl&#8217;s luggage.<br />
It’s certainly heavy.<br />
Why did a woman&#8217;s luggage have to be so heavy?</p>
<p>[Let&#8217;s go]</p>
<p>[Y, yes!]</p>
<p>Somehow, she smiled and started following me from behind.<br />
I heard whispering voices from behind, but ignored it.<br />
Anyway, it was impossible to continue persuading her here.</p>
<p>I felt like I&#8217;m being checkmated, cornered like in shogi.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>When I left the guild, it’s already past sunset and the sky had begun to darken.<br />
People were finishing up today&#8217;s business and closing their stores.<br />
Men were going out to the bars and the attractions in the red light districts.</p>
<p>Marl and I walked in such a situation.<br />
What kind of face did she make?<br />
I gently peeked at Marl&#8217;s face as she walked right next to me, only for our eyes to meet.<br />
What made me happy was that her cheeks were slightly red as she giggled with a hint of shyness.</p>
<p>Damn, cute.</p>
<p>We barely had any conversation, and before we knew it, we arrived at the Scorching Anvil Pavilion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>[Welcome back]</p>
<p>The owner of the Scorching Anvil Pavilion, who opened the door and greeted me when we came in, turned his gaze to Marl next to me and muttered, &#8220;Oh?“ with a face full of questions.<br />
Marl came forward. She’s going to reserve a room.<br />
For the time being, let’s unload the luggage on the floor.</p>
<p>[From today onward, I am Taichi-san&#8217;s belongings! We will be togethe–[what are you saying ]? ouch ouch ouchie]</p>
<p>I grabbed Marl&#8217;s head from behind and tightened it to the last minute.<br />
There was nothing good to let this girl take the initiative in the conversation. Let’s keep that in mind.</p>
<p>[Boss, I&#8217;m sorry for the suddenness, but she wants to reserve a room here, so can you prepare –[Oh, I want to be in the same room as Taichi-san!]&#8211;another room? ]</p>
<p>[&#8230; Um, are you sure you want a separate room? There’s also double rooms.]</p>
<p>[Then we’ll take that! It really hurt! Stop it! It’ll break!]</p>
<p>[We’ll take the separate rooms! We&#8217;re going to eat, so please bring this baggage to our rooms, and we&#8217;ll go eat!]</p>
<p>I grabbed Marl&#8217;s head and dragged her to the dining room.<br />
Although it got us a lot of attention, I gave up trying to explain everything because I don&#8217;t want to worry about it anymore.</p>
<p>[Uh, I want to be warm&#8230; it&#8217;s terrible.]</p>
<p>[I have a lot to say to you&#8230; Phinea, set meals and drinks for two.]</p>
<p>Phinea, who was busy moving around, responded appropriately with &#8220;Aiyo&#8221; and withdrew into the kitchen.<br />
Marl was looking at me with interest.</p>
<p>[Tell me your real intentions, honestly. Why me? There are many people who are stronger than me.]</p>
<p>Old man Woz said that Marl was trustworthy, but I can&#8217;t trust her.<br />
I felt like she’s hiding her true intentions.</p>
<p>[Taichi-san isn&#8217;t a former Knight or a mercenary, right?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>[I’m not, but don&#8217;t answer the question with a question.]</p>
<p>[Well, you don&#8217;t have that kind of experience, but your strength isn&#8217;t normal. It&#8217;s a super-excellent quality from everyone&#8217;s perspective! I think it&#8217;s normal to want to recruit or join you!]</p>
<p>As I was ambiguous in various values ​​in this world, I cannot completely judge whether Marl&#8217;s statement was valid or strange.<br />
It&#8217;s impossible to understand using my common sense, since this was a different world.</p>
<p>[You’ll even use yourself as payment in return? According to my common sense, that&#8217;s not normal. I mean, what about dedicating all of yourself as a young girl? Let me repeat what I said back in the training ground, I&#8217;m also a man. ]</p>
<p>[Thanks to Taichi-san, I can be an adventurer, Taichi-san can devour my body as much as you like every day. This is a profitable and truly win-win relationship!]</p>
<p>[You&#8217;re not ashamed or anything like that!? I didn&#8217;t expect that such a direct expression would come from you!]</p>
<p>While we were talking, Phinea put the set meal and drinks I ordered on the table, and left while muttering [Enjoy your time~].<br />
Don’t meddle with us, kid.</p>
<p>[I can&#8217;t say anything other than Taichi-san, I&#8217;m still a virgin!]</p>
<p>[Noisy!]</p>
<p>I yelled at Marl, who declared so while slurping a forkful of pasta.<br />
I can feel the suspecting gazes already.</p>
<p>[Why do you want to be an adventurer no matter what? At least tell me why you’d go as far as selling your body for it, otherwise I can&#8217;t trust you.]</p>
<p>By the way, the set menu was a Neapolitan-like pasta, soup, and leafy vegetable salad.<br />
The drink was something I had never tasted before.<br />
It was a drink that was not too bitter and had a fruity aroma.<br />
I had never drunk something like it in my original world, but was this an ale? I could feel the alcohol.</p>
<p>[Actually, I&#8217;m a princess from a distant country.]</p>
<p>[Huh.]</p>
<p>I replied while poking the salad.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>[I am almost at my coming of age, so there was a talk about matchmaking two years ago. It was with that bastard Prince, who is famous for his good face but bad personality in the neighboring country.]</p>
<p>[Hmm. Did you jump out of the castle to become a longing adventurer because you don&#8217;t like it?]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a common story.<br />
Template template.</p>
<p>[How do you know Taichi-san! That must be the adventurer’s instinct or something like that! By the way, I don&#8217;t want to go back, so I am trying to take in Taichi-san, who looks promising in the future, and make an established fact!]</p>
<p>[Aren’t you abandoning a lot of things that way? I think you’d be better off staying as a Princess. After all, wouldn’t it be Game Over if I put my hands on you!]</p>
<p>[It will be alright. Isn’t it super romantic that an adventurer gets tied to a Princess at the height of his career?]</p>
<p>[Have you ever heard of the story where the adventurer actually met the Princess in his very first town!?]</p>
<p>I yelled while hitting the empty cup against the table.<br />
Well, truth be told, I&#8217;m not dissatisfied with Marl.<br />
Her eyes seemed to glow with strong will, the smooth brown hair with a ponytail, the body that was one head smaller than me, and the rather modest chest.<br />
Also her easy-going personality.<br />
I liked the appearance and straightforward personality.</p>
<p>[What are you dissatisfied with? I&#8217;m proud to say that I&#8217;m a beautiful girl!]</p>
<p>[You are the first girl I’ve ever met in real life who openly and brazenly says that she’s a beautiful girl.]</p>
<p>What are you, Sailor Warrior? (note: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon/Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon. Here Taichi used ‘Sailor Senshi’)<br />
Marl had ordered something from Phinea when she was eating the rest of the pasta.<br />
Phinea looked surprised, but when Marl whispered, she grinned and returned to the counter.<br />
What? Was that okay?</p>
<p>[Anyway, an adventurer can&#8217;t do that, he&#8217;ll die. I’m sure your family is waiting for you to return.]</p>
<p>[I don&#8217;t want to go home for at least three more years. It’ll be my sister’s coming of age in three years, and she’ll be the sacrifice for that bastard Prince instead of me.]</p>
<p>[You’re actually that wicked!?]</p>
<p>I involuntarily retorted at Marl with a crisp face.<br />
Meanwhile, Phinea left something like a bottle of liquor.<br />
It was a pink liquid that was almost transparent. It smelled sweet.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>[Well, first of all, a toast]</p>
<p>Marl recommends me while saying such a thing, so I ask her to pour it into the cup.<br />
It&#8217;s like alcohol, it was very easy to drink.<br />
It had a slight sweetness and seemed more like juice or something than liquor.</p>
<p>[Easy to drink, what is this?]</p>
<p>[Nectar is a liquor. It&#8217;s easy to swallow, right?]</p>
<p>Having said that, Marl smiles widely.<br />
It would be cute if you silently smiled like this.<br />
Damn, how cunning.</p>
<p>[Anyway, I&#8217;m not going to touch you and I&#8217;m not going to team up. Don&#8217;t do this anymore, I might do something terrible sooner or later.]</p>
<p>[For example?]</p>
<p>[I was invited to a meal like I am now, and I got drunk. If this kind of thing repeats itself, it will surely happen someday.]</p>
<p>Hmm, the cup was empty before I knew it.<br />
When I tried to pour it by hand, Marl poured more for me.<br />
She’s still smiling. What ’s with that?</p>
<p>[Taichi-san is a lot of things, isn&#8217;t he?]</p>
<p>[Ah?]</p>
<p>[Sometimes I&#8217;m worried because you have an unfriendly attitude. Sometimes you act much more mature than I expected, but there are times when you are as pure as a child.]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if she’s complimenting or mocking me.<br />
Even so, this nectar was delicious.</p>
<p>[But, from my point of view, Taichi-san should be the one worrying, right?]</p>
<p>[Where is it?]</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>[You are worried about me, but Taichi-san himself is defenseless.]</p>
<p>[Hah?]</p>
<p>Suddenly, my vision distorted.<br />
My head shook with a terrible feeling of drunkenness.</p>
<p>[Hyuu, wat is dis?]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s okay, it will be over while counting the stains on the ceiling! No need to be worried!]</p>
<p>Marl&#8217;s voice sounded like it had a seductive color in it somehow.<br />
No way, this liquor called Nectar is not only a strong liquor that is easy to drink, but it may have another effect.</p>
<p>[I, I don’t get it&#8230;]</p>
<p>When I tried to say that I don;t understand, my field of vision blurred around.<br />
Marl called out to Phinea and gave a thumbs up.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t hear what they&#8217;re saying, Phinea was also grinning. These guys must be in cahoots!<br />
The adventurer-like guys around him also got excited.<br />
Don&#8217;t be a fool, rape is a crime!</p>
<p>[Hey You!, remember me&#8230;]</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t exert any strength in my body.<br />
Marl with a big smile puts his hand on my upper body, whilst Phinea had my legs.<br />
And I was carried out from the cafeteria as it is.<br />
On the way, they met the inn owner.</p>
<p>[H, helf me, ahm avout to het raffed!]</p>
<p>(help me, I’m about to get raped!)</p>
<p>[The sheets have been prepared.]</p>
<p>You are also in cahoots with them!<br />
This is the worst. It’s like I’m the one who is about to be raped by Marl! And the inn was also aiding her!</p>
<p>[If you really hated her, I wouldn&#8217;t do this either. This is for a lot of people who aren&#8217;t completely satisfied when we hear your argument, okay? Be more straightforward, onii-san]</p>

<p>Phinea who was hefting my legs, muttered.<br />
Certainly, I like Marl, but it&#8217;s a different story!<br />
Although I inevitably tried to resist, I was only able to relax a little.</p>
<p>[Then, take your time.]</p>
<p>Phinea, who threw me into the bed, waved her hand and left.<br />
All that was left in the room was Marl, holding a bottle of Nectar with a big smile on her face, and me.<br />
A bottle of nectar was thrust into my mouth, and my consciousness flew away right there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>I woke up.<br />
It&#8217;s an unfamiliar ceiling.<br />
Yes, this is inside the inn room.<br />
When did I go to bed?</p>
<p>[Nyu&#8230;]</p>
<p>I heard a voice right next to me.<br />
Something was entangling my arm and it was warm.<br />
A girl with brown hair sleeping with a happy face was right next to me.<br />
I wonder if she was hugging my arm.<br />
The higher body temperature of another person was transmitted, and it felt good.</p>
<p>Why did it feel good?</p>
<p>[!?!?!?]</p>
<p>I got up.<br />
The thin blanket was fluttering as I did.<br />
Under the blanket was me, who wasn&#8217;t wearing a single thread, and a girl.</p>
<p>The sheet had a red spot――.</p>
<p>[Ufufu, good morning. Taichi-san ♪]</p>
<p>[Noooooooo&#8212;&#8211;!]</p>
<p>It’s over.</p>
