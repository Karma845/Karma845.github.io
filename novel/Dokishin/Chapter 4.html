<h3>Chapter 4: Honey Traps are the Ultimate Entertainment After School for Scoundrels</h3>

<span class="calibre7">"It's
your own fault, you know? You should have known better before you pointed your
psychic abilities at me."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina said so
in a cold tone as she looked down at a blonde-haired male student cowering on
the ground.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She lightly
kicked him in the shoulder, and the blood-soaked boy screamed so loudly that
his throat went hoarse.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Gyaaaaa~!
P-Please, no more!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Ahaha,
you're overreacting. I just stirred your internal organs a little bit. It
shouldn't hurt that much."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina seemed to
have already lost interest in the male student who was still groaning. She
looked at him as if he were a broken toy and laughed cruelly.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Look, it
seems the next person has arrived. Since you're in the way, could you please
get the hell out of here?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina casually
snapped her fingers, and the blood-soaked boy suddenly began to roll on the
ground.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The boy rolled
three meters through the copse of trees while screaming and finally stopped
when he crashed into the trunk of a spruce tree.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">His body did
not move a twitch after that.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......My
apologies. Our previous guest took a little longer than usual."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina turned a
perfect smile to the male student hiding behind a tree a short distance away.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"A......
Aa............."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina could
imagine precisely the fear he was feeling right now.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">When he
arrived at the &lt;duel&gt; location at the appointed time, he found an unknown
male student being mercilessly beaten up. Anyone with a sane mind and
imagination would be convinced that they too would be beaten to death upon
witnessing such a scene.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Why have
you been hiding all this time? Even though you were the one who challenged me
to a &lt;duel&gt;. Are you perhaps a shy person?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She decided it
was time to end this.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I'm
bored of waiting, so can I attack you now?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Wait......,
stop! Surrender! I surrender!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The male
student, who had been hiding behind a tree, fled the scene, abandoning all
semblance of pride. Without once looking back at her, he cried out loudly and
disgracefully.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">A series of
numbers suddenly appeared in Nina's mind.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">It meant that
she had succeeded in taking half of the points from the student who had just
fled.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">[Grue
Haysworth has conceded defeat. According to the rules, you are the winner. You
are awarded half of Gru's points, thirty-four points.]</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jake, the
strange tin cat who identified itself as the witness of the &lt;duel&gt;,
announced in a mechanical voice, and then flew away. Perhaps he was heading to
the place where the next &lt;duel&gt; would be held.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"............Fuh~."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The tension
loosened and Nina let out a long sigh.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">She always
felt drained after giving her all in her acting. It's only natural, since she
has to erase her own identity and build a different persona from scratch.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Well,
that was easy work. As expected from your acting skills."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The male
student, who was covered in blood all over, stood up before she knew it. With
steady steps, he came closer to her. Where were his previous wounds go?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Your
acting was barely cutting it, though. The way you agonized was way
exaggerated."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
That's harsh. I thought I was good at this."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I wonder
if we fooled that Jake thing? That doll seems to be able to see through
everything."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"A~, no
need to be wary of that one. It doesn't have the ability to record
images."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......Huh?
How do you know that?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">It has only
been about three days since the two officially became accomplices. She had
noticed that Jin had been doing something behind the scenes, but she never
expected him to have dug up such a new discovery.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Once,
Emma and I decided to try a &lt;Duel&gt; with only one point at stake. We
played tag in a wooded area. After she was out of sight, I checked Jake's
capabilities in detail. I tied him to a tree, laid him face down on the ground,
and submerged him in water......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Whoa,
what a poor thing!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">All she could
do was exclaim in disbelief.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">While most of
the students were in the midst of frantically thinking about strategies to gain
points through &lt;duel&gt;, only Jin was fighting in a completely different
field. Although he had said he was aiming for the top of the school, Nina
understood that Jin had no intention of reaching it by any proper means.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No
matter how roughly we treated the doll, it never once raised a voice of protest.
In short, it was just a radio that could fly and move around. It just listens
to our voices, and forwards it to someone in a distant location."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No way,
I thought it was monitoring us this whole time ......."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"If Jake
had such a capability, there would be no need for the instructors to check our
psychic abilities with their own eyes. By making us believe that the doll is
always watching us, they can suppress our malicious thoughts of cheating - it's
a clever way of exploiting psychological illusions. Looks like our headmaster
is quite a shrewd person."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Umm,
what about the pledge?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Unfortunately,
that one is real. I tried to break the rule in the pledge, and I had to forfeit
a point for it. There seems to be no penalty other than defeat."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"A-Are
you so eager to walk on a tightrope that much?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's the
other way around, I don't understand why people would accept such an
incomprehensible system without doing any research."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina was once
again convinced.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">This boy named
Jin Kirihara is completely insane.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">He is a man
who will not choose his means to achieve his goal. He spends enormous amounts
of money and time to perform a single farce, or takes risks without hesitation
in order to gather information. ......</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Just what kind
of life has he lived that would lead him to such a thought process?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina could
hardly believe that Jin had only lived the same number of years as her.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Her
accomplice, who had taken off his gaudy colored wig and removed his disguise,
lifted his mouth and grinned.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Well,
with this, there won't be any more fools who would challenge you to a
&lt;duel&gt; for a while."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">For their
plans to proceed smoothly, it was necessary to spread rumors so that no one
would carelessly challenge them to a &lt;duel&gt; - Jin had suggested this only
two days ago.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The scheme was
a success, but it was by no means without dissatisfaction.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Don't
you think everyone will think I'm some kind of freak murderer or something?
What I just did was definitely going too far."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"The more
extreme the fear, the more vividly it will be remembered. So give it up."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"But
pretending to be a murderer is a bit......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"No, no,
I was just playing dead. I even went to the trouble of staining my uniform with
paint. No matter how much that guy claimed what he saw, nobody can find any
evidence of murder."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Well,
that's true, but ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Just as she
was about to be convinced, Nina realized the worst possibility.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......
No, wait. If the body was not found, then wouldn't that mean people would say,
[The Stingrays must have covered up the crime]? I mean, wouldn't that be rather
more terrifying?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"............Ah,
looks like lunch break is almost over. What's our afternoon class again?
History?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Don't
change the subject so abruptly! We haven't sorted everything out yet!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's all
right. I'm going to add some more rumors that will improve your image."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Eh,
really?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You get
up at 4:30 in the morning to pray for the person you killed."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That
won't change anything! Rejected!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You
founded a new religion to teach children righteousness and purity of
heart."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Wouldn't
that make me more dangerous!?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"On your
days off, you spend your time in the forest, talking to birds and other small
animals."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That
would be dangerous in a different sense! Everyone would be worried about
me!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You're
demanding too much. Have people ever told you that you are selfish?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Y-You
damn fraudster......!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Perhaps to
avoid any further questioning, Jin walked away with a suspicious smile on his
face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">I got carried away by
my temporary emotions and teamed up with an outrageous guy.</span></i></span></p><span class="calibre7">Although it
was partly inevitable since he held her greatest weakness that she was not a
psychic, she still felt that she was being pushed around too much.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Why did Jin enroll in the Heiberg Academy in the first
place?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And where did the desire to reach the top come from?
Is that his true aim? Is there a reason behind it?</span></span></i></p><span class="calibre7">Nina felt that
his motivation was fundamentally different from hers, who had no other choice
because of her family background.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......I
will definitely question you about it someday."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">After
confirming that she has one more goal for the future, Nina also returned to the
classroom building.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......The
first time the existence of a psychic was observed in our country was in 1887
of the Star Calendar - exactly 30 years ago, on July 15, 1887. Yes, as you all
already know, it was the year after a new type of bomb developed by the Allied
Forces was dropped on our capital city."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">A
stubble-bearded male instructor, dressed in a military uniform, was reading
from a textbook in a tedious manner.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The
combination of the tedious late-afternoon class and the slow, drawn-out voice
made Jin feel as if he were being hypnotized.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin, with his
chin in his hands, was attending class with a behavior that was the opposite of
that of an exemplary student.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"The
first ability observed was a manipulation of matter, which is nothing special
nowadays. A young girl, eight years old at the time, surprised people by
levitating her favorite pen in the air. Soon after, a countrywide investigation
led by Dr. Van Dyne Strauss was conducted, and forty-seven children with powers
that could not be explained scientifically were taken into custody."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">What is the
point of studying the history of heretics and the like at the Heiberg Academy,
where the main focus is on fighting for points through actual battles?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin suddenly
looked around the classroom from his seat on the far right of the last row.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Emma, sitting
in the front row, seemed to be fighting desperately against drowsiness, perhaps
bored by the banal content. Nina, wearing the mask of an honor student, is in
the front row pretending to listen to the class attentively.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The instructor
dutifully reads through the tedious text as though he has forgotten the
existence of the blackboard.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"At the
time, those who had awakened to their psychic abilities were despised as
&lt;heretics&gt;. They were regarded as children who had been cursed by the
chemicals released by the new bombs throughout the country. However, as time
went by, the number of heretics increased, and when people with inherent
psychic abilities, such as you here, were born, the situation surrounding the
country changed completely. It was also around that time that it was discovered
that psychic abilities would develop in a wide variety of forms depending on
factors such as family environment and childhood stresses."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The
explanation that followed was too unpleasant for Jin.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">First, the
military and police, then large corporations, mainly in the manufacturing and
transportation industries, began to make use of these psychics. These monsters,
who had powers beyond human understanding and could create something out of
nothing, quickly swept the market and came to dominate the majority of people
who were supposed to be normal.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">As soon as the
boring classes were over, Jin went to his usual place.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">A fountain
that had long since dried up, was located in the corner of the path leading
from the classroom building to the student dormitory area.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Due to the
trees blocking the view from the pathway, coupled with the desolate atmosphere,
the area around the fountain was extremely unpopular.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">When Jin
arrived, there was already a visitor ahead of him on the bench set up in front
of the fountain. Nina Stingray glanced at him and then hurriedly hid something
in her bag.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"What,
are you talking to yourself through your doll again?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Tsk,
wrong! I was just studying this child's modeling from an artistic point of
view......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I
couldn't care less, but if you need to go to a hospital, please just let me
know."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"H-Haaaaa~......!?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina, who was
glaring at him with a frightening expression, looked, as usual, like a
completely different person from when she was in the classroom. Her polite tone
and graceful demeanor were completely gone.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Truly,
you have a terminal personality. That's why you can't make friends!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"What are
you talking about? You're the one whose only friend is that frog doll, aren't
you?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......T-There
are others! For example ...... umm ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">".......
Alright, that's enough. Let's not talk about it, because it's only going to
make both of us feel sorry for ourselves. Don't forget that we're grave sinners
who don't deserve to enjoy our youth in the first place."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina was
unable to find a rebuttal to the bluntness of Jin's statement.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">As Jin said,
the two had committed countless crimes since they became accomplices in front
of this fountain.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina, for
example, has been spreading rumors that are convenient for both of them with a
disguise technique that is so precise that it can never be detected unless
people match the faces and names of the entire school students.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The rumors
changed form as they spread from person to person, and before long, Nina had a
tamed tiger in her dorm room, the Stingrays' pressuring of the railroad company
was responsible for the few delays of the steam locomotives here in Heiberg,
and the recent sunny weather was due to rain clouds that were afraid of her.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Yeah,
this is getting a little ridiculous, isn't it?'"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina asked at
one point, and Jin voiced his opinion with a sigh.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's
just fine to be the butt of someone's jokes. But it's better this way than to
be deified so much that we can't even move properly."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"But who
would believe such rumors?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Of
course there are none." Jin chuckled deep down in his throat. "If
anything, it's better to have rumors with zero credibility spreading around.
From now on, we don't have to worry about the consistency of the rumors
whenever we devise a scheme. Besides, the fact that such strange rumors are
spreading is sufficient proof that you are well-known as a monster, no?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Hmm, I'm
not entirely convinced, but ......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Information
manipulation is all about planting the seeds. If we keep accumulating such
seeds, they may come in handy later on."&nbsp;
</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Seeing that
Nina had no rebuttal, Jin continued.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......Well,
the real game starts next week."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin smiled
fearlessly, like a gambler with a big job ahead of him.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"First of
all, next week, we'll have to go through the first hurdle, which is called
&lt;Ability Assessment&gt;. Once a month, we have to demonstrate our psychic
abilities in front of the instructor. Then on Friday, the &lt;Practical
Exam&gt;, which is the best opportunity to earn points, begins. This one comes
once every two weeks, I think."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"&lt;Ability
Assessment&gt;, huh? Doesn't it sound bad? How are we going to get through
that?......"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You
never thought of that before you enrolled?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......Ugh,
I can't say anything back."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Jin, who has
the psychological type's psychic ability (or so the instructors think), can be
fooled as much as he wants, but for Nina, who has to perform psychokinesis
alone with the instructors, it's a different story. Paranormal phenomena such
as levitating or destroying objects are beyond the scope of what can be covered
by lying or acting.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Well, we
can't keep fooling the instructor with tricks every time."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Huh?
What should we do then?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"We have
to blackmail the instructor."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Black-......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">────</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> Blackmail.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The word Jin
casually said brought an unpleasant feeling to her eardrums.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina hurriedly
objected.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Don't
say anything strange! I don't want to help you with that kind of crime!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I
misspoke, actually it's that. We’re just going to talk peacefully with the
instructors and ask them nicely so that we can go through the &lt;Ability
Assessment&gt; every time."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"That's
definitely a lie! There is no way you are willing to have a peaceful discussion
with them!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I wish
you would believe me there. I was on the student council in middle school, so
I'm used to having discussions with adults."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Didn't
you mention that you never went to school before!?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Of
course not. Even this country has at least a compulsory education system."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I-I
can't...... I don't know what the truth is anymore ......."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Ignoring Nina,
who had her head in her hands, Jin began to explain.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"In the
&lt;Ability Assessment&gt;, about five instructors per class are supposed to
check the students' psychic abilities. So, we only need one sla- ....... I
mean, instructor, to cooperate with us. We just need to ask that one instructor
to be in charge of us every time."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"You were
about to say [slave], weren't you?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......And,
I have some information about the instructor we'll be targeting."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Nina had no
idea where he got the information from, but he handed her a memo with detailed
information.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">The
instructor's name is Rudy Beumer. He is a thirty-six-year-old male. He was
teaching history in their class just a few minutes ago.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Although he is
not a psychic himself, he was hired as an instructor at the Heiberg Academy
because of his leadership skills in the military, to which he once belonged.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">He has a
gambling addiction, which led to his divorce three years ago. As a matter of
course, he is in debt, and is forced to repay his debts every month, even
though he has a stable job.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Incidentally,
he has been hiding these facts from the school for a long time. </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"......You
sure investigated a lot, huh?"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Stop it,
you're making it sound like I'm omniscient and omnipotent."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"I never
said that!"</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">After
instructing her to rip up the memo and burn it once she had memorized its
contents, Jin flashed a wicked grin.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"It's an
ironclad rule of fraud to target people with guilty secrets."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Just like
that, Jin began to outline the plan in a sing-songy tone.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">While
listening to this, Nina was so stunned that she had long passed the point of
anger and confusion.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Beginning with
the information on Instructor Rudy's background and the outline of the
&lt;Ability Assessment&gt;, then laying an ingenious trap for him, and finally
formulating a plan to blackmail him........</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Just how much
time had Jin spent preparing for all of this?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Of course, as
he explained his plan with a grin on his face, Jin seemed to be truly enjoying
the act of deceiving people.</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">But could he
really go to such lengths for such a reason?</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">"Nina,
this plan depends on your acting skills."</span></span></p><span class="calibre7">Various
questions were swirling in her mind, but Nina could only nod her head for the
time being.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That day, Rudy Beumer
had a frustrating morning.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He woke up 30 minutes
later than usual because his alarm clock had malfunctioned, and he had to leave
the house in a hurry before he could eat breakfast. He had to take a different
bus than usual because of a slight delay in his commute, and while he was
waiting at the bus stop, he ran into a debt collector.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although he managed to
somehow get out of it on the condition that he would come up with 30,000 els by
the end of the day, there would be no way he could come up with such a sum in a
hurry. He has put all his savings into gambling, and his payday is still a long
way off. There is no system in place at the academy to allow him an advance
payment of his salary.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While giving a history
lecture, Rudy kept thinking only about how to get the money.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It doesn't even
matter. In a school that emphasizes actual combat, no one would take a lecture
like this seriously.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh, my wallet
is gone!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Shortly after the
hour-long lecture, a female student raised her soft cry, which Rudy didn't
miss.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A red-haired girl with
strikingly black eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy could not
remember many of the students' names, but she strangely left an impression on
him as she continued to listen to the tedious lecture with serious eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The red-haired girl's
friend called out to her with a worried expression.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Kate-chan, is
everything all right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, it's not all
right at all. I was planning to go shopping this weekend, and I left about
30,000 els inside my wallet......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thirty thousand
el!? L-Let's go look for it together! Do you remember where you dropped
it?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"Hmmm</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">ー</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">....... I still had it when I went to the store at the
back of the classroom building, so I think I dropped it when I came back to the
classroom. It's a light blue-colored long wallet."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"L-Let's hurry
and look for it!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">30.000 els</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> , the amount of money was the same as the amount of
money he had to pay to the debt collector by the end of the day. Is it possible
for such a coincidence to occur?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">From what he
overheard, the girls were going to split up and search along the route from the
classroom building to the store.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">I have to hurry.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy, flatly
dismissing all reason, followed the path to the store at a brisk pace.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............What
was I planning to do?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When he reached the
vicinity of the store, Rudy finally came to his senses.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No matter how urgent
the situation, it was unbecoming of an instructor to steal a student's lost
wallet. No, it would be unbecoming of a human being.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Anyway, it would be
impossible to have the 30,000 els ready by the end of the day.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The debt collector
would be upset, but it was the same company from which he borrowed money for
the first time three months ago, and the overall amount was not that big.
Apologies were his forte. So he believed if he did what he always does, it
wouldn't be too serious.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Furthermore, there
will be a &lt;Ability Assessment&gt; tomorrow morning. It's a much more
nerve-wracking job than the usual lectures, and he'd better go home and get
some rest.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just as Rudy was about
to turn on his heel, someone called out to him from behind.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Rudy-sensei. Are
you on your way back to the instructor's office now?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Nina Stingray.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even Rudy, who was
usually negligent in his duties, knew about her, who was feared for her psychic
abilities and was called the &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt;. Her clear azure eyes
are beautiful and at the same time seem to radiate an inexplicable pressure.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And even if Rudy is an
ex-military man, it would be impossible for an ordinary student to get this
close to him without alerting him to her presence.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy tried his best to
hide his agitation as he squeezed out a response.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Y-Yeah. I have a
meeting to attend. There's still time, though......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If that's the
case, then please take care of this one for me."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina handed him a
light blue-colored long wallet.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He recognized it at a
glance and knew the student who had lost a wallet with the exact same
characteristics as this one.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I found it near
the store there just now. I don't know who dropped it, so, may I leave it with
you for the time being?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Sure,
I'll see if I can find the owner."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As Rudy watched Nina's
back walking away, a conflict was raging in his brain.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Did Nina see
the contents of the wallet?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, she must
not have seen it. She said she had found the wallet only [just now].</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Inside were
three 10,000-el bills and some coins. If someone pulled out the 30,000 els,
would anyone be able to tell that I am the culprit?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, I simply
had to testify that there was no money in the wallet when it was delivered to me.
Since the school does not know about my gambling addiction and debt, it is
impossible for me to be suspected.</span></span></i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This way, he would no
longer face remorse in his conscience.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy walked to the
back of an unpopular street and pulled the bills out of the wallet while
keeping a wary eye on his surroundings.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Thank God!
You saved me! Seriously, you saved me!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Guilt? To hell
with it.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The worst
thing that could have happened to someone is to be so stupid as to lose his or
her wallet in the first place. I did the right thing by giving her a lesson.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He walked toward the
building where the instructor's office was located, trying to hold back the
laughter that was rising within him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the way there, Rudy
noticed a strange feeling that he could not ignore.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Don't tell me, am I being followed? By who?</span></i></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Sensei, there's
something I'd like to ask you."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When he turned around,
as if he had been hit by a bullet, standing there was a young boy who appeared
to be an immigrant from the East. Through a gap in his unkempt black hair, he
looked like a bird of prey lurking in the forest at night.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was one of them,
Rudy thought.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Gamblers who frequent
gambling dens, fraudsters who approach with the scent of money, debt
collectors, brawlers, and other underworld denizens - how could a boy like this
have the same presence as them?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Still wrapped in a
whirlpool of questions, the boy smiled fearlessly.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What on earth
are you planning to do with the 30,000 els that you just stole from that
wallet?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wha......."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What is this
guy talking about?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When I took
the money out of the wallet earlier, I made sure there was no one around.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Could it be
that he was using some kind of psychic ability to see? It would take more than
just good eyesight to be able to accurately guess the amount of money.</span></span></i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A light blue
colored wallet. You have it in your coat pocket right now, don't you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Y-Yeah. I was
about to take it to the lost and found now."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You can't fool
me with that kind of random lie. Well, putting that aside......."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The pressure emanating
from the apparently powerless boy made Rudy completely stiffen.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"How are you
doing on your debt repayment, Sensei?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"W-What are you
talking about......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There's no use
in playing dumb. I can read people's minds. There are a lot of conditions,
though. Right, please check the admission documents for more details."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You brat ......
what the hell do you want?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait, wait, you
misunderstand me. Do I look like the kind of guy who would threaten people? Do
I?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The boy turned around
and put on a cheerful smile.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy had no idea what
he was thinking. This made him feel more and more uneasy.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Ah! But
from Sensei's point of view, it must be worrisome. A student knowing about your
gambling, debt, and theft habits is surely not something you'd be comfortable
with. And who knows, maybe I'll accidentally tell someone."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Damn it, don't
get carried away-......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh, did you say
something?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy kept his mouth
shut in a panic and let his thoughts run wild.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Who in the
world would believe the testimony of such a lousy kid?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Now that the
mechanism of psychic abilities has not been fully solved, there is no way to
verify the truth of what a mind-reading psychic is saying.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Let's shut him
up with threats of expulsion from the school.</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time Rudy
thought of this, it was already too late.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina Stingray, who had
just entrusted him with the wallet, was standing behind him with a blank
expression on her face.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Is what he just
said true, Rudy-sensei?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Clad in despair, she
looked so unstable that she seemed ready to destroy everything at any moment.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Y-Y-Y-You've
got it all wrong! This kid is just spouting bullshit!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then, may I see
the wallet I just handed to you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"L-Look! I still
have it!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Still?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah,
no......."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh? Where did
the 30,000 els that were in here go?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......Ugh."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Now, allow me to
check your pockets."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Awawawa........."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">All possibilities
collapsed with a resounding crash.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The Stingray family is
a well-known family that has a strong connection to the upper echelons of the
academy. Even if he were not crushed by the psychic ability, it would be
obvious that his head would be on the chopping block.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy found himself
kneeling on the ground, pleading.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"All right!
I'll-...... I'll do anything you want, just don't tell anyone about this!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Whoaa~, I knew
you were used to apologizing. I'd give you points for your artistry."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For a really brief
moment, Rudy saw the boy's mouth twisted into a crooked smile.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was a smile, like a
hunter staring at his prey caught in a trap.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Now, why
don't we discuss this in a quieter place, Sensei?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time they
returned to their usual fountain after a peaceful discussion, the sun was
almost setting.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After all, deceiving
people never felt good, no matter how many times one did it.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In contrast to Nina,
who let out a sigh, Jin had a big smile on his face.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm glad it
worked out. It was a pretty primitive kind of scam, though."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Really,
what a scoundrel you are. That's definitely not the kind of expression one
would have after having scammed people."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, no. He did
feel grateful to us in the end, remember?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina thought back to
their discussion in the back of the deserted building.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, as originally
planned, had secured an appointment to cheat in the &lt;Ability Assessment&gt;
that would begin later in the week.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy had tampered with
the personnel list and the evaluation sheet, and now the two of them did not
have to worry about their true selves being discovered at the &lt;Ability
Assessment&gt;.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What was most
frightening was that Jin had never asked Rudy to do so.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He cleverly
manipulated Rudy's mind and made him tell us the idea of cheating from his own
mouth. Rudy even expressed his gratitude, perhaps because we were more than
willing to go along with his idea.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, Rudy did
not even suspect that the two were actually not psychics.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But you know,
Nina is the real villain here."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin laughed as he held
out a paper bag he had hidden behind the fountain. Inside were an elaborate wig
and makeup kit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thanks to you
playing a double role, this whole plan is a success."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............ugh."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina could not say
anything back.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She began by
transforming herself into Kate at a time that would not look suspicious to the
other students, then controlled her presence during the lecture to bring
herself to Rudy's attention and make him listen to her fake story about
dropping her purse.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Once she parted ways
with Emma by lying, she would then revert back to Nina Stingray and contact
Rudy. </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Not only is she not
qualified to criticize others, but she is now the main culprit.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"By the way, your
acting is getting better and better. You really were having fun, weren't
you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"T-That's not
true! Stop being so delusional!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Amazing, the way
you deny it doesn't even look like acting......!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-I'm not
acting! Gosh, if you start talking like that, I'm not going to let you get away
with it!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What are you
saying? You kept deceiving people with your acting even before you teamed up
with me."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ugh......!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was impossible to
win an argument with this man, after all.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In order to turn away
from the unpleasant fact, Nina forcibly came up with a question.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Anyway,
how did you even know how much debt Rudy-sensei had?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, of course,
it's something I planted!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Planted......?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The businessman
who blackmailed that man to prepare 30,000 els by the end of the day is one of
my friends."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wha......."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While Nina was still
in shock, Jin slowly explained how he had done it.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I already had my
eye on him even before I enrolled here. I think it was three months ago that I
approached a buddy of mine at a gambling den and got him to borrow 100,000 els
from me at a low-interest rate."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"T-That
long......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The greater the
time interval between [planting] and [collecting], the less likely the other
party will suspect it. If you want to fool people perfectly, you have to work
out a long-term plan."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Every single
time, you do something that takes such a lot of time and effort....... What
drives you so?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's because I
enjoy deceiving people, of course."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......You fiend!
Inhuman! Scoundrel!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Those are all
compliments to me. Oh, are you saying those because you already knew?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What? Do you
feel invincible now......!?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'll make you
regret it someday for sure!" Nina uttered a cryptic line and left the
place.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she walked down the
pathway leading to the girls' dormitory, Nina thought.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although she doesn't
know what his background is, Jin's way of thinking is clearly different from
that of his peers.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He has a completely
crazy sense of ethics, he's unusually prepared, and even though he's not a
psychic, he's more confident than anyone else......</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Seriously, why did he
decide to enter this academy?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With all those skills,
it would have been easy to rake in the money through illegal means. For
example, this time, he could have blackmailed Rudy-sensei and made a lot of
money out of him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she was repeating
these thoughts in a roundabout way, the girls' dormitory came into view.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Around here, Nina had
to switch her persona.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She must return to
being a monster with hidden uncontrollable power, rather than a schoolgirl
being pushed around by an unruly fraudster.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">From here on out,
there is no accomplice who knows her secret.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".............Alrighty."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just as she managed to
impersonate "Nina Stingray," her azure eyes caught sight of a figure
ahead of her.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A tall boy with an
all-encompassing smile and the elegance of the upper class - Bennett Lohr, a
member of the same entrance exam exemption group as Nina - walked toward her
with his hand raised slightly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With an atmosphere
that was the complete opposite of Jin's, Bennett handed her something.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I've been
waiting for you. This is your brooch, right?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How careless of her.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Kate reverted
back to Nina, she remembered being quite flustered because she didn't have much
time to spare. Surely the pin must have been poorly fastened at the time.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"T-Thank
you......"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A brooch adorned with
gemstones should fetch a good price if it were to be sold off.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It gave her chills to
think that if it had been someone with a cunning mind who had picked it up, she
would have been in deep trouble.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't thank me,
I just happened to find it", Bennett interrupted with a sincere smile.
"I only found it by chance. By the way, Nina, there's something I wanted
to talk to you about."</span></span></p>
