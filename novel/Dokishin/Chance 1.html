<h3>Chapter 1: A Bus Coming to an Abrupt Stop, Floating Spheres and
the Philosophy of Deception</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Miracles are dressed
in pure white dress.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">When asked why our
country has come to be feared as a &lt;den of monsters&gt;, politicians and
academics often use such an expression.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">On that day about 30
years ago, the new-type bomb that filled the sky above the capital with pure
white light brought not only the end of the war.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Beneath the pillar of
light that rose to the sky like a giant's dress, a miracle was born in a pile
of rubble covered with death and silence.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It was a year and
three months after the end of the war that a young girl first levitated her pen
into the air.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Although she ended her
short life in an unforeseen accident, she remains a symbol of the Empire to
this day. Among the children born around the same time as the girl's death,
several individuals with psychic abilities that could tame miracles greater
than hers began to emerge one after another.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">These little monsters
eventually reached adulthood.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">By this time, the
Empire had fully regained its former glory.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">A secret agency called the &lt;White Knights&gt; was founded, made up of only the most elite of
the psychics.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Fighting against other
countries, espionage, maintaining public order, assassinating important people
- they reliably carried out every mission, and became an object of fear for
people from other countries who had never seen any miracles, as well as a
glorious future itself for the people living in the Empire.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Heiberg National
Training School for Psychics.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">This is the best
educational institution where candidates for the &lt;White Knights&gt;
gather.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Of the nearly 300
students enrolled, only a dozen or so make it to graduation each year. In the
fierce competition for survival, the students compete against each other with
their psychic abilities, intelligence, and malice, kicking off schoolmates who
grab them by the ankles as they aim for a peak that lies far beyond.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">This academy is the
heart of our country's unrivaled might.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3">I urge all of you who
are about to step into a fiercely competitive society to keep this in mind</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">────</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After reading the
preface to the booklet handed out before boarding the train, Jin Kirihara let
out a huge yawn. Drowsiness, fatigue, and boredom had made his eyes, which were
the same color as the depths of the night, look duller than ever.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He had been on the bus
for three hours.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Thanks to this, he had
to go back and forth between pompous and empty sentences made up by someone
somewhere, even though he wasn't interested in them. Now he could even recite
the entire text word for word without making any mistakes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin looked around the
cabin from the right-hand end of the last row.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The 30 seats are
filled with boys and girls in identical uniforms. Everyone is looking at their
surroundings with a puzzled expression on their faces.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It's only natural. The
route that had been announced in advance did not include a route through such a
mountainous area.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The girl sitting next
to him asked him, her deep green eyes moving busily.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, Jin-kun.
What kind of situation do you think we are in?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">When she introduced
herself, she called herself Emma Licorice. The disturbing situation and the
bright atmosphere created by this orange-colored short-cut hair girl don't
really mesh well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He could have
pretended to be asleep and gotten away with it, but there was nothing else to
do until the bus stopped anyway.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin decided to answer
her question for the time being.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"A~, I heard that
driver is quite famous in his field."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Is that so?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I've heard that
the entire bus got stranded in the middle of nowhere more than once or
twice."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"W-We are in
trouble then!? The entrance ceremony is about to begin after all......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin knew why the bus
was taking this route, and in the first place, when there was a paved roadway,
there would be no possibility of being stranded. It's just a matter of calmly
thinking it through.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He found it a little
funny that Emma believed his random made-up story so easily, so he decided to
add another layer of lies to it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Right, I also
heard another story about it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Even he thought to
himself that he really did have a mouth that turned a lot.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Even though his
destination was a neighboring town 30 minutes away, he got so lost that he
drove for hours through grasslands and deserts, and was finally stopped by the
security forces at the border. I don't know why they didn't just fire
him."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's not at the
level of having no sense of direction anymore, huh ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Exactly. The
fact is, he's a pervert who enjoys taking passengers to crazy places. He's
particularly enthusiastic today, isn't he?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Who the heck did
you hear that from?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"My father. He's
a drinking buddy of the president of the company the driver works for. He's
been saying a lot about how he wants him fired as soon as possible."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Eh? This is a
made-up story, right? What should I do, I don't know what's the truth.
......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Do you think
that made-up stories could keep coming out like this?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He realized that it
was a serious disorder to be able to mass-produce lies almost subconsciously.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Emma seemed confused
as to whether the stories were true or not, but this seemed to make the anxiety
and fear that had overshadowed her relatively diminish.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Emma decided to
discard any unnecessary doubts. The other students in the cabin eventually
regain their composure as well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">That's right, anything
can happen at this school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Besides, we have been
living by denying the common sense of the world, haven't we?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">We can just rewrite
the laws of physics and get out of any calamity that befalls us, as usual. The
boys and girls, all of whom have psychic abilities, reaffirmed such a simple
solution.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Shortly afterward, the
bus came to an abrupt stop.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Amidst a mixture of
anxiety and tension, a man in a suit, who appeared to be in his mid-forties,
got on board.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"We've arrived.
Hurry up, grab your baggage and get off."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">On both sides of the
forest road, which was barely wide enough for a bus to pass, were densely
overgrown with trees. There were no buildings in the vicinity. It was hard to
believe that this was their destination, but the students had no choice but to
comply.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">When she got off the
bus, Emma looked back at Jin with a dubious expression on her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Look, I knew it,
there's no way we would be stranded!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Sorry, sorry.
I'm just joking."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Gosh, why did
you lie to me like that?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"The place we're
about to enter is a really harsh place, you know. Cheating and kicking each
other down is an everyday occurrence. I just wanted to remind you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Eh~, I didn't
know you had that in mind. ...... Thank you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No worries.
Let's work together from now on."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin timed his smile
perfectly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"By the way,
Emma, I still think you're lacking a sense of nervousness. If you like, how
about I give you some tips on how to survive at the Heiberg Academy?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Really!? Are you
sure?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Of course, this
is just one of those opportunities. Normally, the information fee is 300,000
el, but for Emma, it's a special fee of 150,000. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin's mouth, which had
been moving without stagnation, was hurriedly held down with his own right
hand.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, no, can you
forget what I just said? It was very churlish of me and I ended up saying
something like that......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Emma was staring at
him with a vacant look on her face. </span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It seemed that his
next words did not reach Emma, as they were drowned out by the noises of the
students around them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">While inwardly patting
his chest, Jin cursed the tip of his tongue for starting to move on its own.
Even occupational disorders would become a terminal condition if they reached
this point.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin once again
reminded himself that the purpose of being here now is definitely not to make
money.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The three-year job
that is about to begin is a different order of magnitude of difficulty from
what he has done in the past. He must not act rashly in a place like this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"But you know,
Jin-kun. What do you think is going to happen now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Who knows? It's
about time we got a briefing."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Right at this moment,
a man in a suit appeared in front of the group and cleared his throat. With
just that, the noises that had filled the crowd of students instantly
disappeared.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">With all eyes on him,
the man in the suit began to speak in a serious tone of voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"At last, we are
all here, prospective students."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">There was a hint of anxiety
in the students' eyes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The instructor stopped
someone who tried to raise a question with his hand and continued in an
indifferent manner.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"A~a, I know what
you guys are going to rant about. [We should have already passed the entrance
examinations] [Aren't we on our way to the entrance ceremony now?] [This is not
fair] </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> can you put yourself
in our shoes and listen to the same arguments year after year? It's so
distressing that it makes me want to take a leave from work."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The students gasped at
the hostility and contempt bared in his words.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Let me say this
first, in case you're misunderstanding things. The Heiberg National Training
School for Psychics is not a charitable organization! We can't admit ordinary
people who have no value to us!</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Think about it for a
moment, how much money do you think our Empire is pouring into this project?
The massive monthly subsidies paid to all enrolled students is a perfect
example. That's money intended to support promising psychics who want to become
members of the &lt;White Knights&gt;, definitely not charity for filthy
ordinary people!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Whoa, that's a
bit too much, isn't it ......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin muttered in a
voice that no one could hear.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">That man's tone, which
did not try to hide his discrimination against those without talent, was so
merciless that it almost made him laugh.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Normally, I
would be happy to expel all of you lowly swines whose grades were low in the
entrance examinations, but the kind-hearted headmaster has extended his mercy
to you. Those who pass this final examination, which is about to begin, will be
granted full admission to the Heiberg Academy. ...... Do we make ourselves
clear, you swines? That means the 30 of you are on the borderline between
winning and losing."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> &lt;Screening
Test&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Someone's muttering
touched the surface of Jin's eardrums.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">There seemed to be
several students who had heard of its existence at least in the form of
rumours, and each of them clenched their fists tightly and endured the
humiliation. Until now, as individuals with psychic abilities, they had borne
all the expectations of their surroundings and could not have imagined that
they would be among the bottom 10 per cent, the ones who would be eliminated.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">In other words, this
is that kind of a place.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Being a person with
psychic abilities has no value in itself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Only those who have
survived three years of school life can seize upon something.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Now let me
explain the contents of the test."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After confirming that
everyone's eyes had changed colour, the instructor spoke up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"If you go down
the mountain towards the northwest from here, you'll be within the school's
vicinity. It will take you about an hour if you make haste. Those who reach the
foot of the mountain before the entrance ceremony starts in two hours will be
granted formal admission qualifications. Conversely, those who fail to arrive
in time will be expelled immediately. Normally, we would allow those who drop
out to transfer to one of our affiliated schools, but even such treatment is
too good for the swine who drop out here."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Regardless of the
severity of the penalty, the content of the test itself seemed to be really
simple.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin waited carefully
for the continuation of the explanation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"There are two
rules. You should listen carefully, as these will be important for your future
life at the Heiberg Academy. ...... Actually, you are all subjected to a
suggestion by the headmaster during the entrance examinations."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Headmaster Jill Will
Weiser.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">There are only a few
people in the Empire with more renowned psychic abilities than him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">A major figure in the &lt;White Knights&gt;, a mythical figure known from numerous legends. None
of the students have any recollection of ever having received a suggestion, but
it would not be impossible for the headmaster to do so. Since he is capable of
doing things beyond human understanding, it is nothing surprising.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Ignoring the students
who had begun to make a fuss, the instructor's explanation continued.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Suggestions can
be very powerful. Don't even think of trying to remove it with your psychic
abilities."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The instructor said so
while tapping his own temple with his index finger.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"The contents of
the suggestion are very simple. The moment the subject meets certain
conditions, he or she falls into a powerful hypnotic state, regardless of his
or her own will. Over time, the information in their brains will be processed,
and the next time they wake up in a nearby hospital, they will have lost all
memory of the school. ...... This time, it is specially set to be triggered if
you don't reach your destination in two hours, so watch out."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">All the students'
expressions quickly clouded over.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Heiberg Academy is not
only an educational institution, but also an important facility that holds
various state secrets. It is only natural that measures are taken to prevent
information from being leaked to the outside world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">What the instructor
just said was not a bluff.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Their memories are
truly being held hostage.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"The second rule
is much simpler."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The instructor went on
again, still in a straightforward manner.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Every action
that results in death is prohibited. That's all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">At the instructor's
order, the &lt;Screening Test&gt; began, and one by one the students entered
the forest after an interval of about 30 seconds.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Until their names were
called, the students looked at each other. Normally, it would be impossible for
someone to drop out of a test where all they had to do was walk to their
destination. Although it might be possible that some kind of trap is set, it
seemed inefficient in such a vast forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Not sure how many
students were aware of this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">That instructor
deliberately concealed the most important rule from them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"If we travel
normally, we'll be there in an hour, right? What's the point of such an
exam?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Emma, who asked this,
did not have such a serious expression on her face, although her voice was
filled with anxiety.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Well, they're
probably measuring the time it takes to get to the finish line. Maybe something
good will happen if we get there early."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"A~a, so that's
how it is! Great, I'm quite confident in my speed!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"That's good to
hear. Good luck with your record-breaking run."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Actually, he could
have told her the true nature of the test, but it was better to convince her to
believe a random lie than to make her nervous.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Well, it doesn't
matter, Jin muttered inwardly and looked around.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Since only those with
the lowest grades in the entrance examinations are present here, naturally
there are no famous people whose names are well-known before they enroll.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">For example, Gilrein
Bloodnote, who is rumored to be the most likely candidate for the top rank in
the school year, and Nina Stingray, who has had numerous infamous stories told
about her since her childhood, are probably heading directly to the entrance
ceremony venue.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, this doesn't
mean that there are no opponents to be wary of.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Such is the case with
the boy who is glaring at the two boys from the rear side of the bus, a spot
that cannot be seen by the instructor standing at the entrance to the forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">While maintaining an
appropriate conversation with Emma, Jin checked the boy's appearance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Overall, he has an
appearance that makes it hard to believe that he is 15 years old. A body that
is large both vertically and horizontally. A ferocious look in his eyes. A deep
voice. At his feet was a bag large enough to hold a young child, another
element that accentuated his eeriness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"As we said, it's
a false accusation!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Turning a disgusted
kind of smile on the pair, who were shouting like they were about to cry, the
well-built boy hissed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, you guys
behaved in a defiant manner. That's not the way to behave at the academy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"We were just
complaining a bit, you know, about being dropped off suddenly in a place like
this ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Fine, I'll take
that as criticism directed at the headmaster."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Before he could finish
his words, the male student disappeared.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">No, he was blown
backward with tremendous force. His body, which was by no means light, kept
rolling over a distance of about three meters before finally coming to a halt
as he plunged into the bushes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You, what the
fuck are you doing all of a sudden......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The remaining boy
activated his psychic ability in a hurry. His right hand was covered in an
electric current-like glow, but his reaction was too slow. Before he could even
assume an attack stance, he instead found himself forced to reenact the scene
of a few seconds earlier with his own body.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After having
ecstatically watched the conclusion of the psychic phenomenon he had caused,
the well-built boy suddenly turned around to face Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... So, what
are you looking at at? You Easterner over there."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin pretended to be
puzzled by the hostility suddenly directed at him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's a
misunderstanding. I'm not even interested in you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No way, you've
such a defiant look in your eyes."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Sympathetic glances
began to gather from those around him. Emma, next to him, was tugging at his
sleeve to encourage him to flee, but Jin decided to accept the other party's
provocation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You want to be
purged too? Right here, right now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Purge, huh?
...... Isn't that a funny way to put it? Aren't you a student just like
me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I'm different
from you swine. I'm here under the headmaster's orders."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"That's new. Tedd
Lieber-kun."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Hee, an
immigrant like you knows my name, huh? If so, then you can understand why I've
gone to the trouble of taking part in the [Screening Test], can't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin replied with a
thin smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I get it, you're
up for some kind of self-sacrifice."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... What do
you mean? Tell me in simple terms."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Because you're
going to be my stress reliever after this."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The surrounding
students began to make a fuss over his remark, which was so daring. The
instructor, who sensed something was wrong, also turned his attention to them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Regardless, Tedd
glared at Jin at a distance where the tips of their noses were touching.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Are you deluding
yourself? I could easily kill you in the forest."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Heh~, Am I
hearing it wrong about no-killing rule?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's the
headmaster's wish that trash like you should die. Don't worry."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I couldn't care
less about that, but aren't we a bit too close? How are you going to take
responsibility if people get the wrong idea?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"......You
bastard, have you been kidding me since a while ago?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Because Jin kept
dodging around, Tedd was unable to take the initiative in the conversation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Just as his
frustration was about to reach its peak, an instructor in the distance called
Tedd's name. Finally, it was his turn to enter the forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I've memorized
your face anyway. Don't you dare forfeit now."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Don't worry,
Tedd-kun. We'll have plenty of fun later."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After glaring at Jin
as if to curse him to death, Tedd walked towards the forest entrance with a
very large bag in his hands.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Hold on a
second, Jin-kun, what are you gonna do about it!? Somehow it's turned into
something serious. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's all right.
We're actually good friends."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">With one last
appropriate lie, Jin watched the distant back of the other party.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Finally, about the
third from the last, his name was called and Jin had to enter the forest as
well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He proceeded, his feet
repeatedly getting caught in the decomposing ground and the roots of large
trees. The instructor said it would take an hour to get there on foot, but that
would be no easy task for an average 15-year-old. Emma, who had started a
little earlier, must be having a hard time as well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">There were several
cameras set up in hollowed-out bushes and tree trunks. But not enough to cover
the entire vast forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">In other words, there
is really no point in this test other than to eliminate them. The instructors
are probably too busy preparing for the entrance ceremony and can only allocate
a minimal amount of effort for a group of failures.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">As Jin proceeded,
while sharpening his sight and hearing to the limit, he spotted a young girl
sitting with her back leaning against a large tree.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... What are
you doing, Emma?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He approached her,
wary of his surroundings, and called out to her with dismay.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He felt his headache
because of her out-of-place, cheery smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, here you are
at last! Hey, Jin-kun, let's work together, shall we?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What is this,
some sort of new nightmare?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Feeling the need to
revise his plan, Jin let out a sigh.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"A~ ....... Emma,
why are you here?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Because,
Jin-kun, you got into a fight with another student earlier, remember? I was
worried about leaving you alone."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I told you I
would be fine."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The words
"good-natured" were somehow ingrained in his mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps Emma is simply
too naive, rather than having poor instincts. She has little experience of
people's malice, so she doesn't understand the dangers of staying in one place
like this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Of course, that might
even be called a virtue in the general society.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Listen here,
Emma. Are you aware that we are in the middle of &lt;Screening Test&gt; right
now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"That's a
given."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Then, are you
also aware that we're being targeted by some of the students right now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Eh~! Is that
so?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Wait, don't talk
so loud", Jin rushed to cover Emma's mouth with his hand. "...... In
this test, each student went into the forest every thirty seconds, didn't
they?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After making sure she
nodded, Jin continued cautiously.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"That means this
is a game where whoever enters the forest first has an overwhelming advantage.
You can hide in the forest, watch for latecomers, and then ambush them when you
see an opening. We were last in line, so it's not surprising that we've already
become someone's target. So to stand still near an entrance like this is
ba-...... no, I just thought of words I shouldn't have said."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"B-But, you know?
Why would students have to fight against each other? The teacher never said anything
about that, did he?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Since it came to this,
Jin has no choice but to tell her the truth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"The bald-looking
old man explained it to us during the entrance examinations, remember? He said
that points would be allocated to each student according to their results in
the examinations."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Well, in order
to advance, we have to earn points in the weekly exams, right?'</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Yes. In the
academy, the few students with the lowest points are expelled every month.
Especially for the lower grades like us, the points are set so low that we're
suddenly on the precipice."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What does that
have to do with our current situation?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Why do you think
the instructor kept such a basic rule from us earlier?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Emma thought about it
desperately, but no clear answer seemed to emerge.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After a short delay,
Jin cut in.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Below the
surface, the battle for points has already begun."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The biggest clue was
that before the test started, the instructor went out of his way to declare the
rule that [Every action that results in death is prohibited].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">So some of the
students understood the nature of this test and took the right to carry out a
one-sided attack on the students who were enjoying their hiking in a relaxed
atmosphere.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">On the flip side, the
school doesn't need any morons who don't even realize that.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Do you
understand now that we shouldn't stand still here?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Yeah.
Thank you, I didn't realize that at all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Well, you don't
have to be afraid any more than necessary. Nothing terrible will happen. Even
that instructor had a kind face, too, didn't he?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"He looked like a
terrifying soldier, though......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"There's
something warm behind that. He's the type of guy who probably has family photos
on his desk."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, you
sometimes say incredibly random things, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I'm always serious.
Here, look straight into my eyes."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's awfully
murky, though......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's just that
the lighting is a bit off. ...... Never mind, let's just get going."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">This is a completely
unexpected situation for Jin, who had planned to act alone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, it is also
true that few people actively try to target them. For now, he has no choice but
to be flexible and move by incorporating the uncertain element of Emma into his
strategy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">While being drained of
their strength by the unstable foothold, as if they were constantly being
harassed, the two of them steadily advanced their steps.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After working together
for a little while, he found out that Emma's athletic ability was quite
extraordinary.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">She is not out of
breath even though she has been walking at a fast pace for nearly 20 minutes,
and her movements are very flexible as she jumps over the roots of large trees
and rocks laid bare on the ground surface. She moves nimbly onward with a cool
expression on her face as she sucks on a stick of candy. It is difficult for
Jin, who has basically lived his life detached from exercise, to even keep up
with her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Emma, aren't you
moving a bit too fast?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, sorry! I
thought I was already moving quite slowly."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Whenever Emma spoke,
the white stick that protruded from her mouth also shook.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"My psychic
ability is to double my physical abilities for as long as I lick this candy. My
teachers at middle school named it &lt;Ferocious Sweetener&gt;."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Are you
sure it's okay to reveal it to me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It is considered basic
knowledge that the details of one's psychic abilities should not be known to
anyone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">This is because there
are various restrictions on psychic abilities, such as [activation condition],
[duration], [range of effect] and [number of uses], and if these are known,
they can be easily exploited.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, the
activation condition of licking candy is quite lenient, and as long as the
ability itself is a simple one with no special disadvantages, there may be no
problem in telling someone about it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin thought that it
would be a good use of his strategies.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Although his original
plan had gone awry, with Emma by his side, with her relatively powerful
abilities, he might be able to cope adequately with any attack from someone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After walking for a
while, Emma, who was a little ahead of him, asked him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, why did
you decide to become a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt;?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I was told by a
fortune teller I met in a back alley. If I don't graduate from Heiberg Academy
and join the &lt;White Knights&gt;, I'll fall into hell within five
years."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3">"That's awfully
specific ......"</span></p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/bw1.jpg">

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I was also
forced to buy a ridiculously expensive vase, but I wonder if that's what helped
me pass the exam."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You're
definitely being scammed! Wake up!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, it's all
thanks to the vase. I'm not a psychic after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Even I can tell
that's a lie ....... There is no way someone with no psychic abilities can
enter the school."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It has always been
Jin's bad habit to fabricate random stories and make things vague in order to
prevent people from realizing his real motives.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, there's no
way he's going to tell others his true objectives here.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Hey,
Jin-kun. What is that?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">When Emma suddenly
stopped, a scene of destruction spread out beyond her gaze.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The trees in a space
with a radius of about five meters had marks on them as if they had been eaten
up by beasts, and some had snapped off at the root and collapsed. The gouged
trunks at a height that was out of reach of human hands also indicated that
whoever had done this was not a normal being.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, someone's
knocked down. I have to go help. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, wait."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin grabbed Emma's arm
when she was about to rush forward and forcefully took her into the bushes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">As Emma demanded an
explanation, Jin cautiously muttered to her, wary of his surroundings.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"The one who did
that is still nearby. He uses the prey he hunts like that as bait. It's the
basis of hunting. If you approach carelessly, you'll be taken by surprise and
it'll be over in an instant."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"B-But that boy
is hurt."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Look carefully.
There's no sign of bleeding, and he hasn't stopped breathing. He's just
unconscious."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Is that
true?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Anyway, it means
we need to hide for a while."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After confirming that
Emma nodded repeatedly with exaggerated gestures, Jin let out a sigh.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">At that moment, a tremendous
shock hit Jin's shoulder.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Intense pain rushed
through his brain at the speed of an electric current and was released from his
body as a gasp filled with anguish. In his scrambled vision, Jin somehow
managed to find out the identity of the attacker.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It was a sphere
floating in the air.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Its black-painted
surface was shining with a metallic luster, indicating that it had a hardness
and weight that could not be ignored if it were to be hit directly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... What the,
you managed to twist your body right before it hit you, huh? I thought a single
blow would be enough to knock you out."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The one who emerged
from behind a large tree was the muscular student who had just had an argument
with Jin in front of the bus - Tedd Lieber.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Two of the same
spheres that had just attacked Jin were floating around Tedd.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The way they rotated
in a circle around Tedd was reminiscent of a planet and its moons.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"&lt;Anti-gravity
satellites&gt;, are they not? I've heard of it, your abilities."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd whistled
deliberately in response to Jin's comment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Then you do at
least know what's going to happen to you, don't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Who knows? Are
you going to show me some street performances?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You're still
joking around? You should be purged after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Now, now, calm
down, you look like crap you know? Why don't you take a look in the mirror
first?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Enough.
It's a waste of time talking to you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Before he could finish
speaking, three black spheres rushed toward Jin and Emma.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The two ran away from
the spheres desperately, running at full speed with no sense of strategy.
However, the difference in speed was obvious. It was inevitable that they would
fall prey to the sphere before they could get out of the effect range of their
opponent's psychic ability.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Whoa, your
boiling point is way too low! Calm down! Take your calcium properly!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, I think
that's just a superstition."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Emma, do you
know what tension is?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">In the first place,
when he decided to work with Emma, he deviated from the original plan. If he
did not come up with an urgent revision plan, he might actually be killed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Emma, can you
activate your &lt;Ferocious Sweetener&gt;? I need your help."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Hmm, that's
impossible!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You can double
your physical abilities, right? Isn't that amazing? You should be able to move
faster than that sphere and knock it away."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, that's not
what I meant!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Emma said awkwardly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I can only use
that ability once a day......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"............
Ha~? What did you say?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Like-I-said! I
just used it to show Jin-kun, didn't I? So I can't use it again for
today!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You-......"
The words he's been holding back from saying until now are finally leaking out.
"You idiot! Just how flowery your train of thought is!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The spheres that had
been flying in the air above them easily caught up with them, increased their
speed by one more level and fell vertically.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin avoided the attack
by sliding halfway down the mountainside in desperation and continuing to roll,
letting gravity do the work.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">As expected, the
spheres chased after him without paying any attention to Emma.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">While glaring at the
spheres, which were closing in at a tremendous speed, Jin shouted.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Emma! Forget
about me, just go ahead and escape!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No way! I can't
do that!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Just go! With my
psychic abilities, you might get caught up in it too!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd would not give
him the time to wait for a reply.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">To escape from the
oncoming spheres, Jin whipped his aching body and stood up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Using tree trunks and
rocks protruding from the slope as a shield, he ran and ducked the incoming
attacks by a hair's breadth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd didn't chase too
aggressively, but was determined to slowly drive Jin back to a corner.
Apparently, he enjoyed playing it slow and steady.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Despite his
remote-control abilities, he approached slowly down the slope, a behavior
typical of people who tend to have a strong sense of sadism.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">This guy is the type
of person who gets a thrill out of watching his enemies being overrun by fear
and pain.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Are you
sure you want to chase after me, Tedd-kun? Look, one of us has escaped."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He tried to sell Emma
out for a moment, but he knew it was pointless. Instead, he should be glad that
he was able to go back to his original strategy now that he got into a
one-on-one situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd turned a nasty
kind of smile towards him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I've already purged
four people, so I've fulfilled my mission plenty. Now it's time to finish it
off by crushing you to death."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I thought I
heard someone say kill just now. Was it just my hallucination?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You have good
ears. It's good that you're healthy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Thank you. But
I'm not happy to be complimented by you though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd's confidence
remained unshaken, even as he tried to look relaxed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He approached Jin step
by step while being protected by the satellites revolving around him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Come to think of
it, I haven't heard your name yet. Tell me your name before I kill you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I'm sorry, but I
can't give my personal information to a suspicious person."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Suspicious
person, huh? You really don't know anything."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">With a sneer, Tedd
pulled a white envelope out of his pocket. Perhaps it was very important, it
was protected with plastic to prevent it from getting dirty.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's a letter of
appointment from the headmaster. I've been given the role of gatekeeper to make
sure no small fry pass through by mistake in this &lt;Screening Test&gt;."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What a very
creative delusion you have. When did you come up with it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Suit yourself.
Exchanging letters with the headmaster is something that a bottom-feeder like
you can't even imagine after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... I see,
very impressive then."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The distance between
them has already closed to about three meters.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd, looking
completely triumphant, swirled the three spheres above Jin's head. The spinning
spheres, mocking the sacrifice that had lost its escape route, descended,
gradually narrowing their radius.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Now, everything was
set to end with a single signal from Tedd.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">There was no way to
avoid it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It was obvious that
Jin would be hit by the black spheres one after another, and his entire body's
bones would be shattered.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, by the way,
Tedd-kun. Is there an option to overlook me ......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"There's no such
an option, you idiot."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Really?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You're
persistent."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Come on, let's
really talk this through. I'm saying this for your own good. I can't guarantee
I'd go easy on you in a real fight."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Are you serious?
You're still lying even after all this......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I'm not lying.
It's true. There is no one in this world as honest as me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin formed a gun shape
with his right hand, pointed at Tedd's heart, and used his index finger as its
muzzle.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... You think
you can scare me with such childish threats?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Then why don't
you give it a try? If you want to get out of here, this is your last
chance."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After letting out a
long sigh, Tedd took another step forward with the expression of a heartless
monster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Cut the crap and
just die. Fucking bastard."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">This means he has
missed his last chance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Taking pity on the guy
who had lost his cool and fallen into the trap, Jin said.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Well then, sorry
to say this but you're done for."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">At that moment, the
ground behind Tedd exploded.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The sudden sound of
the explosion caused his body to stiffen, and the rolled-up soil of rotting
leaves fell on him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Seeing the white smoke
rising from the tip of Jin's index finger, Tedd understood that this was a
phenomenon caused by Jin's psychic ability.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Unbelievable, I
didn't see anything ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, Tedd-kun.
Are you sure you're okay standing still?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The index finger was
pointed at him again, and Tedd felt his whole body stiffen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Even if he let the
spheres attack Jin, he would probably take five hits in that interval. That's
how fatal the difference in speed is.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Abandoning his pride
that he had been given the mission of gatekeeper by the headmaster, Tedd
decided to run away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He ran down the slope,
almost rolling, trying to gain as much distance as possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The sound of
explosions kept echoing, the ground nearby rumbled, and the fear of death was
slowly overtaking Tedd.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Damn it! I can't
move forward, the rocks are in the way......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">In this area, a large
number of rocks were protruding on the ground surface, limiting his escape
route to only one. Perhaps because his movements had been read completely, the
attacks were also gradually becoming focused on him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span>f I can't escape anyway,
I have no choice but to expose myself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It was quite natural
for Tedd to make that decision.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What, have you
given up already?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin slowly made his
way towards him with a fearless smile, just as he had done when they first met.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Then, will you
surrender quietly? I won't be angry with you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... I've been
handed a mission by the headmaster. If I don't crush you here, I won't be able
to enroll with pride."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Wait, wait. Why
are your pupils so dilated? Can't you calm down for a moment?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Listen, Easterner.
I'm going to kill you for sure. I'll crush you with everything I've got."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Even with an index
finger pointed at him, Tedd glared at Jin without fear.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Indeed, there would be
no way to sneak past an attack so fast that one couldn't even see its trajectory.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">But does this guy really intend to attack me?</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">In fact, even
when it seemed certain that this guy could finish me off, he shot at the ground
to force me to surrender. Since he has no intention to kill, then there is no
need to dodge the attacks. All I have to do is not move from my position and
let the three spheres strike him at maximum speed.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">In the end,
it's the same as always. It's just the start of a one-sided violence.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's a pity that
we had such a well-matched psychic ability."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Again, bursts of sound
could be heard, but all of them were coming from the wrong direction.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"> knew it, this guy's not prepared to attack human
beings.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd grinned and
manipulated the trajectory of the spheres floating in the sky. At a speed that
would surely kill someone instantly if a direct hit was made, he sent it
rushing towards Jin who was standing in front of him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"......I've been
meaning to tell you this for a long time", said Jin, who did not lose his
fearless smile even in the face of the looming presence of death. "You're
quite naive, aren't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Above Jin's head, an
ear-splitting explosion rang out.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Of course, this
happened just before the spheres slammed into Jin. Suddenly, the three spheres
burst above Jin's head, sending countless black shards flying all around him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd's eyes widen in
astonishment and he rants.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What happened
......! T-Those spheres were as hard as iron, you know!? You, how did you
......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"They're just
rubber balls that have been hardened by your psychic ability, right? Otherwise,
there's no way you could carry three of them in your bag."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"How the fuck
......! Damn it!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd, having
completely lost his chance of winning, turned his back on Jin this time and
started to run.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"A~a, you can't
go that way. That's dangerous."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin pointed his index
finger at Tedd, who was running away through the rocks and tree roots. With his
thin lips twisted into a sarcastic smile, he said in a mischievous tone of
voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Bang!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">At that moment, Tedd's
figure disappeared.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Of course, it wasn't
that he had actually disappeared. Nor has his body been caught in the explosion
and shattered into pieces.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It was just that the
ground beneath his feet suddenly collapsed and he was dragged underground at a
tremendous speed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">When Jin reached
there, Tedd was waist-deep in thick, viscous mud and in a state of complete
helplessness. His thought processes had short-circuited, and he had no idea as
to what had happened to him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He would never be able
to realize that what had dragged him underground was just a pit.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin picked up the
black stick he had hidden in the bushes nearby, as he had originally planned.
He knew from prior reconnaissance that there were no surveillance cameras set
up in the area.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd in the hole
finally came to his senses.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"......W-What the
hell is this!? How were you able to destroy my iron ball......!? What's your
psychic ability!? Tell me!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You ask too many
questions, I don't have the energy to answer them."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"A stun-stick!?
Isn't that a violation-......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, no, no. Have
you forgotten the rules?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin pressed the
glowing tip against Tedd's neck.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Looking down at the
guy who was screaming out in extreme pain, Jin proceeded to say.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"If you don't get
out of this forest within the time limit, your memories will be erased and you
will be expelled. How is someone with no memory going to report what happened
here? ...... I mean, you're not even aware that you've been tricked all this
time, aren't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">Tricked? What
do you mean?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span class="calibre7">Don't tell me
I was led here all along?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The questions that
kept coming up one after another were drowned out by the electric currents
coursing through his body.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The last thing Tedd
saw in his fading consciousness was a heinous gleam in the depths of Jin's
dilated eyes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You're finished,
heretic. You weren't worth deceiving."</span></span></p>

</p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">One Month Ago</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"&lt;Screening
Test&gt;?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin Kirihara's
exaggerated voice echoed in the café in the town of Akkas, where the Heiberg
National Training School for Psychics is located.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The tall boy sitting
across the table from him explained with a proud expression.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Yes, it's held
every year for the lowest grades students. In the forest near the school, they
fight for survival."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin's eyes lit up as
he ran his pen over his notepad. He looked like a young boy yearning for his
glorious yet rigorous days at the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">As a matter of fact,
today Jin assumed the role of [head of the newspaper club at a local junior
high school].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He contacted a boy who
was a graduate of that middle school and also a first-year student at Heiberg
Academy, and asked him for an interview as part of a project for the school
newspaper.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">At first, he refused
for reasons of confidentiality, but it was enough to persuade him by showing
him previous interviews with famous psychics who had graduated from the same
school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The photographs used
were simply cut and pasted from small articles in the state-run newspaper, and
the text and layout were nothing more than fakes made by a printer he knew, but
there was no way the boy would recognize them. Of course, he had no way of
knowing that Jin was neither a middle-school student, nor that the uniforms
were from a thrift shop in town, nor that he was using a fake name.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">In the end, he agreed
to be interviewed on the condition that it would not involve any of the
students' personal information or the school's internal affairs.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, people with
psychic abilities tend to have a massive desire for self-expression. If one
properly coaxed and flatters them belatedly, they will spew out as much
information as they can.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Can I ask
you for more details? Of course, we won't write it in the article."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">There was a plan to
get through the entrance examinations, which were due in a week's time, but no
matter how well the plan went, it would be inevitable that he would be among
the lowest-graders.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">So Jin asked for
information that would not be leaked outside the academy, such as where the
[Screening Test] was being held and the details of the annual examinations.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Come to
think of it, the entrance ceremony is already next week. I hate that this
year's new students are full of famous figures again. You see, I heard that the
daughter of the Stingray family is enrolling as well."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Nina Stingley,
huh? I've heard a lot about her."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3">t gives me goosebumps
to think of having a monster like that in my class. Well, it's none of my
business as I'm about to drop out. ...... Oh, by the way, you are also a
psychic, right?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Are you aiming for the
Heiberg School after all? Do you want to join the &lt;White Knights&gt;?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No-no, it's
outrageous for an ordinary person like me. I'm aiming for a private training
school somewhere.''</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After stating this in
a blunt manner, Jin changed the angle of his question.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"By the way, are
students allowed to enter the forest you were talking about earlier?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">After all, it's off-limits, isn't it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, it's not.
There is no confidential information hidden in the forest, it's really nothing
more than a forest. And it's a bit far from the academy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Ahaha, right, of
course."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Now he had all the
information he wanted.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">While sorting out the
rest of the questions, Jin had already begun to formulate a strategy to pass
the [Screening Test].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">If the objective is
just to survive, the content of the test will not be that difficult.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, if one were
to think about their future life at the school, they would have to make a
strong impact on the students while earning as many points as possible. If he
could gain some recognition here, it would make it much easier for him to
proceed with his future plans.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">So, first of all, he
needs to prepare a duck that enjoys standing out and is easy to deceive.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Three Days Ago</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"......Certainly,
I've received the payment. So, what the hell are you doing this for?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The question asked by
the man in his work clothes in the middle of the night in the forest was a
fairly natural one.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">When one receives a
request that makes no sense whatsoever, which is to implant explosives that can
be remotely detonated throughout an empty forest, and even to create an
elaborate pit </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> it is only natural
that one would want to confirm the client's true intentions. The three
employees who were working on it also had a dubious look on their faces.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's the same as
always, Gasta-san. I've got some people I want to deceive."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Are you talking
about infiltrating the nest of heretics? ...... I see, so this is just a
gimmick to give the illusion that you're a psychic who specializes in using
gunpowder."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Well, something
like that."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin couldn't help but
smile wryly at this man's good intuition, which was unbefitting of a rough man
in his forties.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin has known Gasta,
the &lt;Landscape Gardener&gt;, for more than six years now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He has worked on a
wide range of projects. This is not the first time he has installed gunpowder
and booby traps, as he did this time, and he has also been commissioned to
build a gambling hall and a ticket booth in one of the buildings, and even
provided extras for a major project.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He is one of the
people who knows Jin's true identity and is willing to help him in his race for
survival at the academy for a fee.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"With so many
obstacles in the way, your escape route will be limited, so if you run away
without thinking, you're sure to fall into this pitfall."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"We had a really
hard time finding a good spot, you know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Even though only
failed candidates took part in the test, it was unlikely that the management
would not provide any surveillance at all. At the very least, there must be a
number of cameras installed for surveillance purposes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">However, modern
technology has not yet succeeded in shrinking the size of the cameras capable
of capturing images, so the number of places where they can be hidden is
naturally limited. If there are no tall bushes around, and if there are
protruding rocks on the ground surface that can easily create blind spots, then
there should be no problem.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Although it was quite
laborious, it only took half a day's walk through the forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"So you will
pretend to run away from the enemy and lure him/her here? But will it work that
well? The other party must have psychic abilities, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"A~a, don't
worry. I've spent a lot of time in the last few weeks training my duck."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... He hasn't
even enrolled yet, has he? What a terrifying kid."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Gasta laughed as he
exhaled purple smoke.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"So what's your
poor victim's name?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Tedd Lieber.
Born and grew up in Ibrick, his birthday is August 2. His favorite food is rib
steak, and since he was a kid he's been the biggest and fiercest kid in his
class.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">His psychic ability is
&lt;Anti-Gravity Satellite&gt;. It is an ability to manipulate three black iron
balls at the same time, but that is only on the surface. In reality, it's just
an ability to manipulate rubber balls after hardening them like iron. He carries
the rubber balls in a custom-made black bag, so he often bumps into
things."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Oioi, you know a
lot."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"He's always had
no enemies in his hometown. He's been so wild that a year ago he used his
psychic abilities to commit a robbery. Everyone close to him knew Tedd was the
culprit, but they kept quiet about it because they were afraid he would kill
them. Apparently, in the countryside, there are no policemen with psychic
abilities, so he was completely free to do whatever he wanted."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Whoa, how did
you know so much? Did you hire a detective?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No", Jin
pulled some white letters out of his pocket. "The man himself told
me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Gasta shone his
flashlight on the letters and scanned over the scribbled words.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">[How can I increase
the output of my psychic ability? Please give me some advice!]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">[The people around me
are really idiots. I can't wait to enroll and receive your guidance.]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">[Headmaster, I will
definitely live up to your expectations in the &lt;Screening Test&gt;!]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He didn't have the
energy to read through all of them, but he was certain that the crude
handwriting that seemed to be written by a rough boy and the sentences that
seemed to be infatuated with the other party didn't mesh well together.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"When the results
of the entrance exam were announced, Tedd stood out among those who had
gathered in the hall. He intimidated everyone around him for no reason, and got
angry that his posted rank was at the bottom of the list. ...... I thought that
guy, with his overconfidence and lack of caution, would make a good first target."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"If you take out
the attention-seeker first, you'll be less likely to be criticized by those
around you, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"That's the
point. You're a perceptive guy after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I'm flattered to
be praised by a fifteen-year-old boy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">At Heiberg school,
where competition for points is fierce, it's obvious that the less talented
participants tend to be targeted first. If a large number of anonymous students
simultaneously targeted him, it would be game over at that moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, it was
necessary to establish a track record of having defeated a powerful person in
the first place.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I slipped an
envelope and a letter with the headmaster's signature on it in his pocket. I
wrote a brief outline of the &lt;Screening Test&gt; and a request for him to
serve as a gatekeeper there.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Speaking of the
headmaster, Jill Will Weiser, there is not a single person in this country who
doesn't know about his psychic abilities, right? If a letter from someone like
that suddenly appeared in his pocket, he would surely think that he was being
highly expected. All that's left to do is to continue exchanging letters and
extract his personal information and psychic ability weaknesses."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Exchanging
letters, you say? ....... Don't tell me you've been pretending to be the
headmaster all this time and communicating with Tedd? Wouldn't he find
out?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's called the
prestige effect. That type of person will never doubt the word of an authority
figure."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"But what about
the address? There's no way you could have it sent to the headmaster's
house."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I lived for
nearly two weeks in a cheap hotel near the school. I had the letters sent from
there. Tedd probably thought they were delivered to his mansion on the
outskirts of town. It's so far away, there's no way to verify the authenticity
of the address."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After hearing this,
Gasta held his belly and laughed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"You know what,
you've gone too far".</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"If I didn't go
to such lengths, I wouldn't be able to catch a duck."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"No, no, no,
you're becoming more dependable", Gasta said so heartily. "But to
think that little brat who was so attached to Rusty-san become like
this......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What are you
getting all sentimental about, old man?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I'm impressed.
You've grown up to be a great con artist. ...... So, how are you going to trap
him on that day? No matter how many traps you set, it won't be enough if you
get crushed by his psychic ability."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"At 6:24 a.m. on
the day of the entrance ceremony, Tedd will board steam train No. 5, which
departed from Ibrick. I sent him a train ticket in the name of the
headmaster."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Why would you go
through all that trouble yet again?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's a trade,
Gasta-san."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin chuckled lightly,
as if welcoming the thrill that was about to come.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I already know
the name of the rubber balls he uses and the product name of the bag from the
letter. All I have to do is to take advantage of the time when he is asleep on
the long trip and replace the bag containing the rubber balls with the fake one
I prepared for him. Of course, there's a remote detonator inside those
balls."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"I see. The
moment he confront you who would be unarmed and convinced of his victory, his
prized iron balls would be destroyed to pieces. It's like a nightmare."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Gasta could not help
but feel sympathy for the boy who fell prey to Jin's deception. He would never
have guessed that he had been targeted weeks before he enrolled in the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Tedd might not even be
aware that he had been deceived until the very moment that he was defeated by
Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, can I ask
you something?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"As long as it's
not about personal matters."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Why would you go
to such lengths? It's not like you've been dreaming of becoming a member of the
&lt;White Knights&gt; since you were a child, is it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Whoa, that's a
very personal question."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Is it
revenge?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... No, it's
not. I just love to deceive people."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The moonlight was
blocked by thick clouds, and Jin's true intentions were lost in the darkness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"It's like a
comedy, isn't it? Having a mere con artist walk into an academy full of psychics
in the flesh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Using the rope in his
bag, he pulled the unconscious Tedd up out of the pit. Then, after throwing the
stun stick into the pit, he covered it with dirt. All that was left to do was
to have Gasta and the others destroy the evidence at a later date.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"...... Right, I
almost forgot."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Jin dragged Tedd a
short distance away and then slipped a piece of paper into his uniform coat.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It contained a list of
evidences of his misdeeds, which Tedd himself had confided to him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">If he attached the
address to which the check should be sent and the amount charged, Jin might be
able to recover at least the cost of this time's expenses. Given Tedd's
father's income, it should be a painless amount.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">Of course, since Tedd
would lose his recollection regarding the school after this, there is a big
possibility that he might not be able to get the hush money. But it doesn't
matter. It is not about making money after all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The number
"ninety-five" suddenly popped into Jin's mind, perhaps due to the
influence of the suggestion given to him by the headmaster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The number was
probably included the amount of points Ted had taken from other students.
Although the number did not reach the target he had initially expected, it
could give him at least a passing grade.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">After that, everything
went smoothly without encountering any enemies, and Jin arrived at his
destination with only three minutes left to go.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">As he was calming down
Emma, who was rushing to him with tears in her eyes, he noticed that all eyes
were on him from all directions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Oi, that guy
......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"What the heck?
He survived?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"That Tedd or
whatever he's called looks stronger than him though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">The students'
reactions were roughly as he expected.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">It was thanks to the
fact that he went out of his way to make his involvement with Tedd noticeable
to everyone. With this, Jin earned the minimum amount of points and a
reputation as [someone who should not be messed with carelessly].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">When the time was down
to zero, the instructor finally opened his mouth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">"Time is up.
Eighteen people, huh ...... that's quite lot of students left."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">While the students
were frowning at the lack of words of praise, Jin's thoughts were already
shifting to the next step.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He is the only person
who has ever enrolled as a mere ordinary human being in the Heiberg National
Training School for Psychics.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">He is weaker than
anyone here. There is no doubt about that. To achieve his objective, even a
single failure would not be tolerated.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A~a, what an exciting game.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre7">With a competitive
smile on his face, Jin stared at the unfolding battlefield in front of him.</span></span></p>
