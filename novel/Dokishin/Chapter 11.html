<h3>Interlude</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A figure wearing a
black hood moved through the silent night forest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The figure had just
emerged from Bennett Lohr's room.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Having been expelled
from school, Bennet's room is to be vacated in three days. Before then, Jin
Kirihara was bound to pay a visit to Bennett's room. Jin probably believed he
would still be able to obtain useful information although the odds were almost
nil. Therefore, he would surely come searching for it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Hence, the person in
the black hood has prepared a present for him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A piece of paper with
just one sentence on it, [Nice to meet you].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That alone should be
enough for Jin to understand. The black hooded figure knew what Jin was really
after, and she knew everything about him. Even after being aware of this, she
was still merciful enough to play along with his silly game.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To begin with, the
hooded figure felt something strange about Jin's actions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was foolish of him
to target the group exempted from the entrance exam first in the race for
survival at the Heiberg Academy. Furthermore, in the battle against Bennett,
Jin only gained 53 points in the end.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There were plenty of
easier opponents for him to win against, whether it was to gain a large number
of points or to gain a solid reputation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Such a hasty move did
not match the impression he had left when she first met Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was clear that he
had some other objective in mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For example, it was to
find the &lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt; that were supposed to be lurking in each
grade.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If he acted in a grand
maneuver involving that many students, everyone would recognize that [Jin
Kirihara is actively trying to destroy the group exempted from the entrance
examinations]. Once it was obvious that Bennett was a fake one, Jin steered the
course to stand out anyway.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As soon as the
possibility arose that Jin's fangs could reach &lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt;, they
would have no choice but to approach Jin. To determine whether he was really a
dangerous person who needed to be purged. To see how much information he knows.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In other words, Jin would
be able to suspect everyone who approached him from henceforth. A game of
deception is about to begin, in which both sides will be able to probe each
other's gut without revealing their true faces, and this will be full of
malicious deceit.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If this guess is
correct, it can be assumed that he is a great schemer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The hooded figure
sensed something unfathomable about Jin, including his ability to nullify
psychic abilities. At least for now, she couldn't simply brush off these
speculations as overthinking.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Interesting."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She found her voice
leaking out.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the darkness, where
she couldn't see a millimeter ahead, she didn't have to worry about anyone
overhearing her. So there would be no problem if she took off this hood and
mask.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Deception so happens
to be my specialty."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The pale moonlight
shone through a gap in the trees.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her orange hair and
dark green eyes were briefly revealed and soon melted away into the darkness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She laughed deep in
her throat as she sucked on a stick of candy she had taken out of her pocket.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">To Be Continued...</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">ã€€</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>
