<h3>Chapter 5: Ultimate Entertainment After School for Scoundrels</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin was running along
the uneven mountain path, out of breath.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Compared to the
average 15-year-old boys and girls, his physical strength was remarkably low, probably
because he had lived away from physical exercise since his childhood.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He finished third from
last among students of class 6 who participated in the physical exercise and
received puzzled stares from the students waiting near the bus.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For the time being, he
had to put on a nonchalant expression and pretend that he had been skipping
physical exercises because they were silly.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, are you
all right? Did you get hurt somewhere?"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma, who probably
finished first, gave him a worried look.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~, I'm fine,
I'm fine. My psychic ability requires a lot of physical strength, and I
wouldn't be able to handle it if I had to use all of my strength in this kind
of training."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Gosh, I was so
worried, you know? But you're right, if a boy ran as fast as he could, he
wouldn't be this slow."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course. Even
though I'm looking like this, I'm still pretty good at sports."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin went ahead and
boarded the bus, feeling a little hurt.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since there was still
some time before departure time, there were few passengers on board ahead of
him. Jin aimed for the last row while he still could.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh dear, have
you finally made it to the finish line? I thought you were stranded
somewhere."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On his way to the last
row, his accomplice, who had been hiding behind a seat, spoke to him while
grinning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Ignoring the
provocation and taking the seat directly behind her, Nina turned around with a
look of triumph on her face.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Despite always
being so confident, you have such a cute little weakness, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Weakness?
What are you talking about?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're not good
at sports, are you? Look, I won't tell anyone, so why don't you be honest with
me? This Onēsan will comfort you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I guess I've
been misunderstood all this time."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin sounded deeply
dismayed as he continued,</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"We're not going to
get a single point even if we come in first in this exercise. If that's the
case, then it would be best to use them for preparation, no?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There you go
playing tough again."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It was a
mistake, I ended up getting top grades in class during the &lt;Ability Assessment&gt;
in the morning. Rudy-sensei was overdoing it. Leaving Nina aside, it's a little
inconsistent for me to suddenly get a very high score after having participated
in the &lt;Screening Test&gt;."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina also tried to
recall her memories of this morning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Rudy-sensei, whose
weakness had been seized by the two, welcomed her into an empty training room
with a large amount of cold sweat pouring out of his face.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Oh, I've
been waiting for you, Nina-san! Please have a seat over here!"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After she sat down on
a pipe chair in bewilderment, Rudy-sensei began to explain in a quick manner.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Actually, I'd
like to see you showing me your psychic abilities and check your growth in
terms of output, new applications, etc., but I am very well aware of your
capabilities! I will be responsible for giving you a good score. You can rest
assured!"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps, he is usually
using this kind of humble attitude to avoid the wrath of the debt collectors.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina could not help
but be amazed at the refreshingly scummy attitude.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Um, May I go
now?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, wait a
minute! Please promise me you won't tell anyone about that incident......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I understand, so
please don't get down on your knees. It’s outrageous."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's skill in making
such obedient [collaborators] after only an hour or so of negotiation is as
frightening as ever. No, it's Rudy-sensei who has too many issues......</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time she
finished her not-so-pleasant recollections, a question came to her mind.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Huh? Does
it have something to do with you being so slow?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course it is.
If I make it look like using my psychic ability drains my physical strength
tremendously, it won't look suspicious when my grades suddenly go up. I ran
slowly on purpose to create that impression."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh? You are
lying, right? There's no way that's your real reason."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nobody could lie
this smoothly. Besides, do you think someone who is really bad at sports could
be so arrogant?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hmm, indeed
....... Unless you set a new all-time record, there's no way you could be this
arrogant ......"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There were still a lot
of things she wanted to pursue, but she decided to drop the conversation as the
other students were getting on the bus.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They could never let
anyone know about their accomplice relationship.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once back at the
school, the students changed from their sportswear to their uniforms and were
dismissed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin and Nina also left
the classroom building early and headed to the usual strategy meeting place.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The topic of
discussion this time would be the &lt;Practical Skill Exam&gt; coming up this
weekend.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Currently, I
have 94 points, which is still in the [C rank], according to the standard
ranking system. Only the bottom five are eliminated each month, but ......
considering the number of people who have been eliminated due to
&lt;Dueling&gt; in the past week, I'm not sure I'll be able to make it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Looks like you
must not lose on the next &lt;Practical Skill Exam&gt; no matter
what......"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This morning,
Isabella, the instructor in charge of Class 6, announced the contents of the
exam that would be held three days later.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The game was called
&lt;Chase Tag&gt;, and the rules themselves were quite simple.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On a field the size of
a gymnasium divided into two, obstacles made of pipes and wire mesh were
placed. The basic concept of the game is to use these obstacles in a
three-dimensional way to play a one-on-one game of tag. The players take turns
playing tag three times, and the winner is the player who has the highest total
number of seconds to escape.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There is a rule
against destroying obstacles, but this is probably irrelevant to those who
cannot use psychic abilities in the first place.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The level of
difficulty in this case is on a different order of magnitude from that of a
&lt;duel&gt;, in which the students are free to do as they please. The
instructor will be present to witness it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Can't we rely on
Rudy-sensei again?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Impossible. The
witness for the &lt;Practical Exam&gt; will be Isabella, the instructor in
charge of our school year."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh, what shall
we do then? There's no way to cheat, is there?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, for me, as
long as I can avoid dropping out in the early stages, that's all that matters.
But Nina, you have to stay on top. If by any chance you lose to someone else,
...... ah, I'm afraid, I can't talk about it from here on out."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hey, stop it! Don't
scare me!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Moreover, it's
not enough for you to just win. You have to make them think that you have
stupidly strong psychic abilities, and then you have to crush them
completely."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"W-W-W-W-What
should we do then? We can't even use gunpowder this time, can we?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"All right, we'll
just have to overcome them by acting!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-Impossible! My
acting isn't magic!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, it's a
complete dead end, then. What are your plans for your second life?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait, please
don't give up on me so easily! Look closely and you'll see that I have a lot of
good things to offer, too!"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin said in a tone
that was almost choking with laughter.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm just
kidding. I have a plan ready for you."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just as she was about
to pat her chest and say, "Thank Goodness", Nina hurriedly came to
her senses.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It reminded her of a
certain fraudster who takes advantage of the weak and vulnerable, making people
feel anxious to the limit and then offering a solution to reassure them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She almost danced
right on the palm of his hand.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After smiling lightly
when he saw Nina's alarmed expression, Jin began to talk about his plan.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's a lottery
match-up, Nina."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">According to the
information that Jin had obtained before enrolling, the pairings for these
one-on-one games were decided by lottery. A box containing numbered plates
would be prepared, and the two people who picked up the same number from the
box would fight.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In other words, the
pairings could be easily manipulated by picking out a plate in advance and
pretending to pick that plate from the box on the day of the game.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If the two of us
are paired against each other, we can easily pull off any number of theatrical
acts. All you have to do is pretend that you're using your psychokinesis to
stop me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That sounds like
a total dumb spectacle......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"From the
perspective of the person doing it, yes, but as long as it doesn't look
suspicious to the instructor, that's all that matters. Oh, and I have to earn
something for my labor too, so can you pretend that you're moderately having a
hard time?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I'll try,
but..."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you still
worried about something?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"How do you steal
the plate in the first place? After the briefing was over, the teacher took
that box back to the instructor's office, remember?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, that's
already taken care of."</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin casually said so
and tossed a circular white object to Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When she looked
closely at it, she saw that it was a plate with "14" written in the
center.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh, when did you
get this?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Instructors are
out of the office during lunch break, so the security in the instructor's
office is lax. Not to mention important documents, it's easy enough for me to
tamper with a box randomly placed on a desk."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Where did
you develop such a bad habit?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I told you one
day. I was trained by the boss of a robbery gang. I wonder what he's up to now.
I heard a rumor he escaped from the state prison."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's totally
different from the story you told me before......"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina said with a sigh
that he was as untrustworthy as ever, and turned to leave.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although it would have
been fine to dismiss the discussion as it was, Jin had something he needed to
ask her.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Hey. Come
to think of it, you've been hanging out with Bennett Lohr a lot lately, haven't
you?"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He is a member of the
same group as Nina who was exempted from the entrance exam, and is a very
famous person who belongs to the neighboring class, Class 5.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although not as famous
as Nina, Bennett has been a well-known psychic since junior high school, and he
is showing off his talents in this school as well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It has only been two
weeks since he enrolled at the school, and yet he is said to hold an absolute
position in his class, and what is surprising is that a fan club has even been
formed among the female students.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, I've been
interacting with him in some way since the entrance ceremony. Does it bother
you that much?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-It's not that
I'm jealous or anything."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Even if you said
it in such a silly way......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't care
what you do, but don't be overly relaxed and reveal our secrets to him."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's a
baseless worry. He would never do such a foolish thing. He is a gentleman, and
I trust him a lot more than I trust you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What are you
saying? There is no one in the world as trustworthy as me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Can you
do what you say at least once?"</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a look of utter
dismay on her face, Nina left.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin bit his lower lip
lightly as he watched her move away from him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">From the side, Bennett
is clearly interested in Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is probably just
camaraderie between upper-class individuals, but he can't rule out the
possibility that there may be another purpose.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Let's investigate, just in case.......</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's character is
such that he cannot simply ignore the suspicions that have arisen.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the cafeteria at
dinner time, which was crowded with students, Jin was eating alone in silence.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As usual, he was
seated by the window farthest from the doorway. Here, he could see the whole
situation and was not likely to be interrupted by anyone.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As he was nibbling on
a piece of bread while listening to his surroundings, he overheard a
conversation that caught his attention.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I heard
that all the C-rank students are participating."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Who the hell is
everyone? I'm not participating. Besides, is this Bennett guy even
trustworthy?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You'll know when
you meet him. He's the real deal."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin focused his
attention on the conversation he heard.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To summarize the
conversation between the two boys, it seemed that Bennett was planning to
gather students in the bottom 20% of possession points - the so-called [C-rank]
students - and start some kind of aid operation.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Some sort of meeting
was to be held in a warehouse on the school grounds later.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin ate the remaining
food in one gulp and decided to follow them as they left the cafeteria.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The technique of
tailing had been drilled into him since he was 10 years old.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In crowded places,
where it is easy to lose sight of the target, he would get as close as three
meters, and in such deserted nighttime streets, he would maintain a distance
that would just barely allow him to see the target. In the case of Jin, whose
face has become somewhat well-known through the recent &lt;Duel&gt;, he needs
to be especially careful.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While being very
careful, he chased after the duo as they walked toward the direction where
there were only a few buildings.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">There should only be a playground over there.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin was suspicious,
but his suspicions were confirmed when the duo disappeared into a warehouse on
the outskirts of the playground. The warehouse is large enough to store several
large agricultural machines, so it might be a good place for a large group of
people to hold a secret meeting.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As he crouched behind
a bush to check on the situation, Jin was struck by a sudden misfortune.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh, Jin-kun?
What are you doing here?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wha......."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What a bad
time, this woman!</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While holding his own
mouth shut from screaming, Jin glared at Emma, who suddenly appeared in front
of him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was probably on
her daily run, dressed in the school's gym clothes, looking downward at him
while wiping the sweat off her face with a towel.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Well, I
was just observing some ants, you see? I just spotted a rare species."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You can see ants
in this darkness?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Have I mentioned
that my eyesight is five times that of a normal person? ......Anyway, don't
worry about me, better get back to your training. You've got one last
competition coming up, right? It's none of my business tho."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There's no
tournament-...... huh? Look, Jin-kun, there are a lot of people gathered
there!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin muttered in a
somewhat half-hearted manner.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I wonder
what all these guys doing here? Are they perhaps arguing over the girl they
like?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh, that sounds
like fun! Let's take a look!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin let out a single
sigh, as if he were spitting out his entire soul, and then switched his
thoughts.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In any case, there was
nothing they prepared to get into that warehouse.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since they also fall
under the [C-rank] category, it might be possible for them to participate
through the front door in a normal way.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There were no
qualifications or secret passwords for participating in the mysterious meeting,
and the two were able to enter the warehouse without any difficulty.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was more than
enough space for more than 20 students to gather. The triangular cones, line
drawers, and other equipment were arranged along the walls, leaving a small
space in the center. The bare light bulbs hanging from the ceiling made the
center of the space stand out in the darkness.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It kind of looks
like a circus stage, doesn't it?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While nodding in
agreement with Emma's comment, another thought flashed through Jin's mind.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">If what he imagined
was correct, this place was</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Emma", Jin
whispered, "this place may be dangerous. We should get out of here while
we still can."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah,
Bennett-kun!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His suggestion was
futilely drowned out by the noise that rose up in the warehouse.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As he was giving up
and watching to see what would happen, Bennett Rohr came in through the sliding
door at the entrance.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The C-rank students
who had crowded into the meeting place were all looking at Bennett with
expectant gazes. The organizer of the meeting approached them with a smile on
his face, and without being instructed, they split into two groups to form a
pathway.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett walked
leisurely through them, making his way to the center of the warehouse.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When he looked back at
the students, they were lined up in a three-column formation without being told.
Perhaps because they were newcomers, Jin and the others were urged to line up
on the far right of the last row.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma, who looked
suspicious, asked in a whisper.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh? Weren't
they going to have a debate about who's their favorite girl?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course, it's
a lie, did you seriously believe it?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The students in the
center of the front row glared at them, so Jin and Emma hurriedly kept their
mouths shut.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett looked over at
his obedient subordinates with a satisfied expression, cleared his throat, and
then began his speech.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"First of all,
thank you for gathering here. This is the second time we've done this activity,
and it looks like we have quite an increase in numbers. Let's see..."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Including those
who were not notified in advance, there are a total of twenty-three of
us."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thank you for
your report. I see......There are already 23 participants, huh? It seems like
our activities are getting bigger and bigger, and I'm even a little bit
scared."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin peered into
Bennett's eyes, smiling wryly, but could not see any trace of malice there. It
is one of Jin's special skills to sense people's malice, but has his sense
become dull due to living in a school where only people of his own age are
present?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, Bennett's
blue eyes caught Jin's gaze head-on.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Since
there are some newcomers, let me explain once again the purpose of this
activity."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He continued in a
sagacious yet powerful voice typical of someone who was used to being in front
of an audience.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Those with quick
ears may already know this, but six first-year students have already been
expelled from school. And that's before the end of each month, when the
&lt;elimination&gt; date is still to be decided. This would be impossible
without a &lt;duel&gt;, with all the points on the line."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's tone of
voice dropped a notch as he continued.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But the question
remains. Is it really necessary to take such a risky gamble this early
on?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The other party was
obviously looking at Jin as he spoke, so he had no choice but to answer the
question.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"C-rank hunting,
right? I've heard rumors of it."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
right."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett snapped his
fingers in affirmation. Jin found this gesture rather annoying.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The six who were
expelled were all C-rank students just like you. Although they were lucky
enough to pass the &lt;screening test&gt;, if they did not do anything, they
would have been candidates for the monthly elimination, in which five students
are eliminated each month. Someone is taking advantage of this situation.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps that someone
is luring them into a &lt;Duel&gt; with unreasonable conditions, because they
want points so badly that they are desperate for them. Perhaps whispering that
they would give up all their points if they could win. They could even be using
their psychic abilities to intimidate them."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I thought it was
just a rumor. Is there really such a villainous person?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"There is no
proof, of course. The result of the duel will not be made public unless the
person himself tells everyone about it. At the very least, I think it's too
much to be true that a single villain is hunting down C-rank students. But some
individuals are taking advantage of C-rank students' weakness and earning
points </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"> that's probably the
truth."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">According to the
information Jin has gathered so far, the average number of points held by first-year
students is around 200, and although he does not know the level of the C-rank
hunters, he doubts that they are below average.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The culprits are
definitely among the top scorers.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, it is true
that they are just acting according to the rules. It's the school system that
is at fault, the one that allows C-rank students to be preyed upon."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Some of the students
listening to the speech seemed enthralled by Bennett.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I am sure you
are all aware of this. This academy, which encourages the survival of the
fittest, is so cruel. It is not an educational institution, but only a
battleground. Even the rule of filling out a pledge with the consent of both
parties is meaningless if you are threatened with psychic abilities."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
right!" A voice, raised in terror, rose from somewhere.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You can tell
this from the fact that the instructor was not present at all, and instead,
sent only those dolls to the &lt;duel&gt; between the students. There is
nothing here to protect you from the attacks of the powerful. ......If so,
there is only one thing for you to do. You have no choice but to become strong
yourselves!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Almost everyone
present applauded in agreement with Bennett as he spoke more eloquently.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After waiting for the
applause to die down, Bennett declared in a loud voice.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The rules here
are simple. Each of you will give out five points each, and the top three will
win all the points in the tournament. I'll give you 10 points, which is not a
lot. The condition for winning is to hit your opponent with this rubber knife.
Simple enough, right?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett smiled at Jin,
as if he could see right through his doubts.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Oh, and
of course, no students above B-rank, including me, are allowed to participate.
In other words, everyone here has a chance! I'll be responsible for cracking
down on any dishonest behavior. Well then, let's get started. You decide on the
pairings so that there will be no complaints."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The participants began
their preparations with expressions full of ambition and hope.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In a school like Heiberg,
where it is difficult to turn the tables for the bottom scorers, this seemed
like a revolutionary move. The five-point entry fee is not that much, and if
one wins the tournament, the reward is huge. This is a genuine charity.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, Jin was still
unable to acknowledge this.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Because there was no
benefit for Bennett in this deal.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......You look
dissatisfied."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As he was about to
leave without being noticed, he was stopped by someone from behind.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He thought about
ignoring it, but that wasn't going to happen because Emma had already looked in
his direction.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, I just
thought I'd refrain from joining today. I haven't made any preparations after
all."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you perhaps
the type of person who can't believe in unconditional goodwill?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As if to counter Jin's
argument, Bennett went on.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"In that case,
you can rest assured. I have an objective, as well. ......As I mentioned
earlier, the nature of this school is a survival battle between the weak and
the strong. If that's the case, then my strength alone will eventually reach
its limits. That's why, I wanted a group of people with whom I could work
together in friendly rivalry."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why did you go
out of your way and choose C-rank students?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, you call
it [choose]? Do I look like such an arrogant guy? ......They were the first to
ask me for advice. I thought the situation they were in was terrible, so I just
helped them out this way. To be honest, the objective I just told you about was
an afterthought to reassure you."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His rational argument
is flawless. There is not even a hint of malice.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, I'll still
go back to the dormitory quietly for today. Right, Emma?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh, let's at
least observe-...... Ah, wait!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett did not try to
stop Jin from leaving.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With the occasional
cheer at his back, Jin clenched his fists and headed back toward the night
path.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Impatience swirled in
his heart.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">That guy is dangerous.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if Bennett was
really hosting the meeting out of goodwill, the fact that he had more than 20
subordinates after only two weeks or so of enrollment was undeniable. Moreover,
all of them are truly grateful to Bennett, and some of them are even enthralled
by him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On top of that, he has
that psychic ability.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is so powerful that
he does not even need to hide it from those around him, and for that reason is
feared by the entire school.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Originally, Jin had
planned to target one of the students who were exempted from the entrance exam
early on. One of the potential targets was Bennett, but it seemed that he
needed to revise his plan a bit.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps because he was
taking it so seriously, he was unaware that he was being called from behind.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was only when he
was tapped on the shoulder that Jin remembered Emma's presence.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I finally caught
up! You just keep going further and further ahead."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......A~a, sorry."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've been
wondering for a while, you should be having fun more often. It's not just about
Jin-kun, though."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm always
having fun. Look at this big smile of mine."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You've got a
really expressionless face, you know?......"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After chuckling,
Emma's expression turned unusually serious.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun, you
see. I'm having fun every day meeting so many kids who are in the same
situation as me. Here, people are not afraid of me just because I have a
psychic ability. ......That's why, Jin-kun. You shouldn't make such an [I won't
believe in anyone!] face. The world is actually not that bad."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Yeah,
yeah."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before they knew it,
the student dormitories came into view. The women's dormitory is on the other
side of the classroom building, so they had to part ways here.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she was leaving,
Emma waved her hand and said.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You've been
talking to Nina a lot lately, haven't you?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't really
remember, but I hear people interpret it that way."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Please be nice
to her! She's always looking so lonely, too."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah-......."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma was standing
right under the streetlight. Her outline was framed by the gentle light, and
Jin couldn't help but squint his eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She lives in the
light.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She is a little too
dazzling for people who live with dark secrets - liars like Jin and Nina.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While he was thinking
about what kind of sarcasm he should return, Emma turned her back to him and
started to walk away.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">On the day of the
&lt;Practical Test&gt;</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The students of
Classes 5 and 6 were gathered in front of the gymnasium, which was located on
the outskirts of the school's spacious grounds.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin observed his
surroundings from a short distance away from the crowd.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, who was wearing
a strong act, and the others who were talented, such as Bennett, kept a relaxed
expression on their faces.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the other hand, the
students with lower grades - the so-called [C-rank] students - seemed to be
fighting hard against the pressure of having no choice but to show results
here.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps due to the
extreme tension, there has been no end to the number of students who have
rushed to the restrooms located near the gymnasium since a few moments ago. It
seemed that one of the private rooms had been occupied since before the
assembly time arrived, as if some of the participants were under severe mental
pressure.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No wonder, Jin
thought.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If they were among the
five students with the lowest grades at the end of the month, their memories
would be immediately erased and they would be expelled from the school without
any questions asked.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Isabella, the
school's grade advisor, appeared from inside the gymnasium, the students all
fell silent at once.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Looks like
you've all gathered here, heretics", she said with the same excessively
abusive tone as usual. "I will once again explain the rules of the
&lt;Chase Tag&gt; we are going to conduct this time."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A one-on-one game of
tag played on a field with obstacles.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Three rounds of tag
are played, with the participants alternately taking turns as the demons, and
the winner is the one who has the highest total number of seconds to escape.
Everyone was familiar with the outline of the game up to that point.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There are a few
additional rules. The winner of this game can take points from the loser for
the difference in the number of seconds they escaped."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The students started
to make a fuss over the rules that Isabella announced so nonchalantly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">One of the female
students raised her hand hesitantly.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... What if
we lose points beyond the amount we own?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You swine are
not allowed to ask questions. Do you want to be expelled?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After saying this
coldly, the female instructor contorted the edges of her mouth.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Of
course, there is a limit to the number of points you can earn. No matter how
many seconds you are behind, you will never lose more than 50 points.
Conversely, the game ends when one of the participants is ahead by more than
fifty seconds. That's the second additional rule."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin understood the
feelings of the female student who was utterly stunned.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps she, too, just
barely passed the entrance exam and was forced to take the &lt;screening test&gt;.
Many of the participants in that test had less than 50 points.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As though she didn't
care about the despair of the weak, Isabella continued.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The last thing
I'll explain is what is forbidden. The use of psychic abilities is of course
allowed, but if you injure your opponent, you will be given a penalty of -20
seconds. Also, as a general rule, destroying obstacles is prohibited. That's
all."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Conversely, direct
attacks are permitted as long as contestants are prepared to bear the 20-second
handicap.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And if one were to
knock one's opponent unconscious, the game would be decided at that point.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait......!"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps unwilling to
back down, the girl from earlier cut in again.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I can't accept
those rules! It's as if there's no room for those with psychic abilities that
aren't suited for combat......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Exactly."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Isabella declared so
without changing her expression.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The academy is
not a sanctuary where we take care and nurture you, plebs. This school's
purpose is to find talented individuals who can be sent to the &lt;White
Knights&gt;. Even if your psychic abilities are not suited for combat, all you
have to do is to make the best use of them. We have no use for incompetents who
can't even understand that."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No
way......"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What? We are
generous, you know? We can even introduce you to a new place to transfer to. Of
course, we will erase your memory of this place......"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, going to
another affiliated school does not close the doors to the military, police, and
some large companies.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But the only way to become
a candidate for the &lt;White Knights&gt; is to graduate from the Heiberg
Academy.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Students who entered
the school with dreams of becoming heroes of the country would never accept a
transfer to an affiliated school. The school is fully aware of this mentality,
and is therefore encouraging intense competition.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is a truly
tasteless scheme. Jin felt like applauding.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......As I
thought, the weak ones should be eliminated as soon as possible. Let's change
the rules."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The instructor
suddenly said something outrageous.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"We will change
the match-up system to a self-reporting one instead of lottery. Nominate the
opponents you want to take as your prey, starting with those who have the most
points at the moment.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The female student who
had been expressing her opinion to Instructor Isabella suddenly turned pale. If
such a rule were to be made, she would be the first to be targeted.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her eyes met with
Nina's, who was standing at a distance.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was entirely back
to her former self, her little mouth agape.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah ...... what
an unexpected situation this is."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The number fourteen
plate that he had hidden in his pocket turned into nothing more than a piece of
junk.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, all he had to
do was ask Nina, who would have the second highest points, to nominate him.
Everything would be fine.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well then, the
first one is you, Bennett Rohr. Pick your opponent."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett put his hand
on his chin and made a thoughtful gesture.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everything about him,
from his slender back, to his innocent smile, to the dark circles around his eyes,
seems to have been sculpted with perfect calculation.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With all eyes on him,
Bennett declared.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I would
like to nominate Nina Stingray as my opponent."</span></span></p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/bw5.jpg">

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What a disaster, Nina
thought inwardly.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, who is known as
a monster at the school, has no choice but to accept Bennett's challenge with a
fearless smile on her face.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With no good solution
in mind, the instructor leads them into the gymnasium. The reason why only the
people playing the game are allowed in the gymnasium is so that their abilities
are not known to anyone unnecessarily.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......What a
scary expression you have there. We're not going to kill each other you
know?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was an unfortunate
mistake that she was not able to hide her agitation, but Bennett seemed to
interpret it in a positive way.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For the time being,
Nina decided to take advantage of the misunderstanding.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm bound by the
rule that I can't injure people. Even though I can't control my abilities very
well when I get excited."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, please go
easy on me."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her acting as an
unstable monster should have been perfect, but all Bennett did was shrug his
shoulders a little.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her usual tactic of
making her opponents surrender by acting is not going to work on a real
powerful opponent like Bennet. After all, it was not even magic.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This might be the end
of everything, she thought.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her thick mask would
come off, and her true self would be exposed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If that were to
happen, there would be no one to protect her.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Uuu. I'm
sorry, Jin."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina muttered in a
voice that no one could hear.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That was all she could
say to her accomplice, who was probably still outside the gym thinking of a way
to reverse the situation.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The first to play the
role of the demon turned out to be Bennett.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Across the obstacle
composed of pipes and wire mesh, he was smiling a perfect smile.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin had told her about
Bennett's psychic abilities in detail. And the more she learned, the more it
seemed to her that his power was so great that it would not matter if many
people knew about it.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As soon as the instructor
sounded the whistle, Bennett pulled out a box of matches from his pocket.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Looks like you
already know about my psychic abilities, Nina."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina nodded, a gentle
smile plastered on her face.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After staring at her
with satisfaction, Bennett lit a single match. He did not move from his spot,
staring at the flickering flame at the tip of the match.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">I wonder if he is still not coming to chase me.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The hope that sprouted
for a moment was quickly shattered. Once that one is completed, she will no
longer be able to do anything but wait to be destroyed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It began with a small
mass of fire the size of a fist.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fireball generated
in front of Bennett gradually gained momentum and reshaped itself like clay
being kneaded. Eventually, the flames grew to exactly the same height as the
tall Bennett, and its shape began to mimic that of a human being.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span></b><b class="calibre4"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Executioner of Immolation.</span></b></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The burning figure,
which has been given such a grandiose nickname, is said to act autonomously in
accordance with Bennett's instructions. It is almost as if he has created a
single imaginary creature. No matter how one looks at it, it is far beyond the
level of a mere student.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Look, I touch
you."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time she
realized it, Bennett, who was slowly walking toward her, had tapped her on the
shoulder.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's the
matter? You're spacing out. Look, it's your turn."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, who had come to
her senses, hastily made her way to the starting position for the role of the
demon.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The autonomous fire
puppet was dispersing high temperatures all over the field, and just standing
there was making her break out in a sweat.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina is supposed to be
able to guard her surroundings with her powerful psychokinesis, so she has to
maintain her nerves so that her face alone does not break out in sweat.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What should I
do?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If Jin were
here, what strategy would he offer?</span></span></i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Alright, time
out."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just as she was about
to burst into tears, Bennett suddenly blew on the match.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With that as a signal,
the &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt; also vanished like a phantom.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was unable to
grasp what was happening, but Bennet muttered to her in a calm tone.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"This game is not
fair. Your &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt; is too powerful to be used in a place like
this. It's impossible to avoid destroying obstacles. But if you were to attack
me without regard to the rules, I wouldn't be able to survive either."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then what are
you suggesting?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"How about we
both conspire together?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Conspire?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I mean, let's
pretend to be fighting and get through this game. Well, let's decide the winner
by rock-paper-scissors. As long as one of us loses by only one second, there
should be no problem."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Yay! I never thought it would turn out this way!</span></i></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was a great offer,
but jumping at it with such vigor was against the character of [Nina Stingray].</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina expressed her reluctance
for a moment.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's an
interesting suggestion, but I wonder if the instructor would allow such a
thing."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Our abilities
have been well proven in the &lt;ability assessment&gt;. It is not against the
rules, so there should be no reason for the instructor to say anything about
it."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The instructor glared
at Bennett, but there was no sign that she was going to argue with him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina pondered whether
she could trust him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, it doesn't matter
whether she can trust him or not.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If she did not take
him up on his offer, her life would end there.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......I
understand. Let's do it. Certainly, it would be a shame to have one of us
killed in this kind of exam."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After a tedious farce,
the winner of the &lt;Chase Tag&gt; was Nina.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She won by one second,
which would not have been possible if it had not been mutually agreed upon. For
these two, who already possessed an enormous amount of points, it was really a
very small change.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina and Bennett left
the gymnasium together, as those who had completed the exam were allowed to
return to the classroom building.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The stares of the
waiting students pierced their backs. She didn't look at Jin because I didn't
want to appear unnatural, but she wondered what kind of expression he had on
his face.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The two of them walked
in silence through the school grounds, which were gradually turning a deep blue
color.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Should I thank
him?</span></span></i></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While she was
wondering whether she should thank him or not, Bennett broke the silence first.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nina, have you
given that matter some thought?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On the way home that
day after she roped in Rudy-sensei in the &lt;ability assessment&gt; fraud,
Bennett, whom she met near the dormitory, suggested that the two of them should
form an alliance.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett has several
C-rank students in his employ through his charity work, and he is leading the
race for survival at the school.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Besides, having talked
to him so many times, he seemed to be a good guy.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That is, not to
mention the fact that compared to that villainous person who enrolled in the
school under the disguise of being a psychic and is trying to survive by
committing fraud upon fraud.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Still, Nina could not
accept this offer.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......My
apologies. About that..."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, are you
perhaps feeling bad for Jin Kirihara?"</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina couldn't hide her
shock at Bennett, who seemed to have predicted that she would refuse.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I-It's
nothing to do with that man!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Sorry, I didn't
mean to offend you. Of course, I know there is nothing going on between you
guys. I just thought you might be having trouble dealing with his
advances."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She felt like she was
being tremendously misunderstood, but Bennett's eyes were serious.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After last week's
&lt;duel&gt;, they avoided getting involved with each other in the classroom as
much as possible, so she wondered if Bennett had caught them together
somewhere.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You were cutting
corners during your &lt;duel&gt; against Jin, weren't you? ......I know you're
not the monster everyone says you are. He is taking advantage of you and using
you. It's okay to discard someone like that."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Looking at Nina, who
could only smile vaguely, Bennett continued.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"And I'm sure you
share my beliefs."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......What kind
of beliefs do you mean?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You've heard the
rumors, haven't you? Currently in our grades, [C-rank hunts] are rampant.
Several students are being forcibly expelled from school before they even
receive their official notice from the school at the end of each month. They
lose their memories of their time here and are expelled."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So, you want to
change the school system?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's not that
grand. It is true that the school encourages students to crush each other, and
I don't like some of it, but ...... I don't have the power to change the whole
system."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then, what are
you planning to do?"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I just want to
give those who are exploited the power to fight for themselves. It's one thing
to be ostracized as a result of healthy competition, but to be threatened with
psychic abilities and forced to engage in &lt;duel&gt;s is absurd. If they gain
strength, the [C-rank hunts] nonsense would cease. Well, the only thing I can
do now is host a competition."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... No, I
don't think that is something anyone can do."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Until now, Nina has
seen many psychics with arrogant ideas.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At the dinner parties
her father took her to, at the welcome parties for freshmen, at the family
dinner tables.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett, who embodies
the duties of the noble, is surely the righteous one.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So much more so than
them, who are trying to fool the world.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, there's no
need to rush. We still have time."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......Sorry."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, it's okay.
Just be careful with Jin Kirihara. I can sense something ...... you know, fishy
about him."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">T-That's absolutely right!</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She almost nodded her
head unintentionally.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is true that Nina
knows very little about Jin's past. She only knows that he is hiding something,
but she has not been told the secret that lies behind his thick skin.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But it was not going
to be easy to discard him either.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He is not just an
accomplice necessary to survive in this academy.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There is something
more fundamental about him that she feels a connection with him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she desperately
tried to figure out what that was, it seemed that she had arrived at the
classroom building. As they part ways to go to their separate classrooms,
Bennett smiles gently at her.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Let me know if
he's still bothering you. I'll take care of it."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I can't let you
go through all the trouble."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yeah, sorry. I
got a little emotional. Well ...... let me just give you a little warning for
the next &lt;Chase Tag&gt;. Rough things are definitely not a good idea."</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For a moment, she
couldn't read the emotion behind Bennett's eyes, but she decided not to think
about it too deeply.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before that, there was
something she needed to know.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What secrets does the
boy, Jin Kirihara, hold?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What kind of
background has made him what he is today?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Why did he come to the
Heiberg School, even to the extent of resorting to outlandish lies?</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Without finding those
out, she knew she would not be able to proceed any further.</span></span></p>
