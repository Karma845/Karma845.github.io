<h3>Chapter 9: Murderous Intent and Silence, Things Disappearing in the Flames</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What are you
spacing out for, run!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina finally came to
her senses when her arm was grabbed, and she fled as fast as she could from the
oncoming presence of death, with Jin, who had become desperate while pulling
her hand.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's wrong,
Nina!? Was your power a lie? Why must you run away so desperately?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett was no longer
in his right mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once they were caught,
it would be over. The two of them would be burned to death by those horrid
monsters.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nina, at least
you have to escape."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin pushed Nina away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As expected, the three
monsters rushed toward Jin, not even bothering to pay attention to Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, the mastermind
behind all this, surely lacked physical exercise. Sure enough, the distance
between Jin and the monsters was getting closer and closer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A total defeat, he
thought.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even though the two of
them had devised a plan and even pulled out a trump card such as Method Acting,
Bennett was far ahead of them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His psychic ability
could no longer be stopped.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Not only do they not
know the true conditions for activation, but they do not even know the limits
of his abilities. Perhaps there are more than just three &lt;Executioner of
Immolation&gt; that can be summoned.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When Bennett snapped
his fingers again, the flames surrounding the three puppets suddenly increased
in intensity. Soon, the flames intertwined with each other and became one huge
fireball.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No, stop!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No matter how hard she
strained her voice, it would never reach the emotionless monsters.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Desperate pleas are
futile. Tragedy always lays waste to everything without regard to human
emotion.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A fireball so large
that it engulfed a large tree expanded at once,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A giant-like arm shot
out from within it,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">the trees planted at
equal intervals were violently set ablaze,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">while scorching the
surrounding air with extremely high temperatures,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">the flames, so
mercilessly burning,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">engulfed Jin's entire
body as he jumped into the shade of the trees.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............ No
way."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In a fraction of a
second that the huge burning arm had swept past, the hardwood tree in which Jin
sought shelter had been completely charred.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Jin, who was hiding
behind it, was no longer </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... It's a
lie, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina prayed before the
sight of the irreversible end.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Tell me it's a
lie, like you always do,....... Laugh at me with that spiteful look on your
face while you make fun of me. We're going to fool the world together, aren't
we? Don't you dare die on me now, I won't let you get away with it!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The despairing silence
corroded her heart mercilessly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was killed. Jin
Kirihara was killed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her one and only
accomplice in the world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The first person in
this cruel world whom she could truly trust.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The most unbearable
fact was that she was not putting on an act right now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ahahahahahaha~!
That feels so good. By the way, why do you find this incineration of such an
insignificant trash so painful?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Screw
you!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~a, don't look
at me like that. I killed him in the heat of the moment, you see. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a smile like a
broken doll, Bennett summoned another one of his &lt;Executioner of
Immolation&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His eyes seemed to be
hollow and devoid of light. They were the same kind of demons as his brothers
in the &lt;White Knights&gt;, the kind of demons who think nothing of killing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What will
happen to me now?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By thinking about it
as if it was someone else's problem, Nina managed to prevent a mental
breakdown.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then Nina, shall
we go back to the dormitory together?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......What are
you-?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"We'll have a
&lt;duel&gt; of course! I have a spare copy of the pledge form in my dormitory.
I have to deprive you of the memory of me killing Jin Kirihara."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I would
never-......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Have you
forgotten about the C-rank guys I've been eliminating so far? They refused to
sign at first, too. But after a little intimidation with my &lt;Executioner&gt;
...... I don't need to tell you the rest of the story, right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Don't you
know what I can do? If you piss me off, you're nothing."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, your
acting is starting to wane, you know? I already know that you are not the
monster everyone says you are."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before Nina knew it,
she was surrounded by four puppets, and there was nothing left for her but
despair.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then again, the
headmaster sure is a villain for creating such a memory-sealing system. Thanks
to it, I have yet to receive any punishment."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The unbearably high
temperature and fear made her feel like she was going to lose consciousness at
every second.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Come, let's
hurry back to the dormitory and sign. ......Oh, you can rest assured. I'm not
going to burn a woman like you to death, either. I'm telling you the
truth."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett patted her on
the head in a gesture like he would do to his dog.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A psycho who finds
ecstasy in dominating everything by force.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina has no strength
left to even point out such a fact.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah, right. Since
your memory is going to be erased anyway, I'll be pardoned for whatever I do to
you now, won't I?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett said this in a
tone as if he had come up with a fun game, and sent instructions to the fire puppets.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The four of them
worked in tandem and approached to surround Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Ah ...... stop,
stay away.'</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In this situation, all
hope had long since perished, and all that was left was the fear of not wanting
to be burned alive.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina desperately ran
away, almost falling down several times due to her trembling knees.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The loud laughter of
Bennett, excited by the sight of the pitiful figure, stuck to her eardrums. The
blazing monsters blocked her way, limiting the direction of her movement. Nina
had long since realized that she was being led to the student dormitory, but
there was nothing she could do about it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If I was going
to experience this kind of fear, if I was going to be so devastated by this
loss, I shouldn't have trusted anyone.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If only I had
kept moving forward alone in a world without light, I wouldn't have had to
experience anything like this. No matter what punishment awaited me after I was
exposed for lying, I would simply accept it as something inevitable.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was wrong
of me to believe in such things as hope.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina resented her own
weakness for having no choice but to put her trust in such an ambiguous thing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, you poor
thing, you're trembling so badly. But don't worry. No matter how frightening it
is, it will all be forgotten in a few hours."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Maybe Bennett is
right.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once I forget
everything, I can go back to square one.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Father would never
forgive me for dropping out of the academy so quickly. So, I would be banished
from the Stingray family and would have to spend the rest of my life in seclusion
somewhere far away, in a poor environment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Still, isn't that far
better than living with this bitterness?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is much better than
being crushed by the weight of what I have lost.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's time to go
to the dorms, Nina. Let's enjoy ourselves to the fullest. Until I get tired of
you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moment the door to
the dormitory appeared in the distance, Nina was swallowed up from the inside
by the swell of her uncontrollable emotions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">No.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I don't like this. I
don't want to forget about Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if the pain would
come back to haunt me every time I remembered him, there is no way I could ever
forget the days I fought alongside him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was the only person
in the world who could be my accomplice, whom I could trust with all my heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If he were to
disappear from my memory as well, I would lose the comfort of my heart. I would
also lose the reason to believe that I, such a person, could still be alive.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With each step she
took, Nina felt something precious slipping away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett didn't feel
the slightest bit of emotion toward Nina, who was running away in fear, nor
toward the scenery of the approaching dormitory, nor toward the witness who was
following behind him as it flew above the ground.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He had always been
able to use his unique abilities to get things done as he wished, and his days
at the school all seemed to be a predetermined series of events. There is
nothing more tedious than a game in which the outcome is obvious from the
beginning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This &lt;Duel&gt; was
no different.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He had made no special
effort, except for hiding a secret plan, and yet he was able to eliminate the
annoying Jin Kirihara.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett pondered his
future life at the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Having defeated Nina,
one of the students exempted from the entrance exam, Bennett will definitely
stand out from his peers.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">First, he will use his
fame to expand the scale of the competition.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Right now, there are
still only a few C-rank students, but in a couple of months, there will be more
participants of higher rank. At that time, he can finally move into the phase
of having them pay points in exchange for participation fees.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once he has
established a system that allows him to earn points without having to do
anything, there will be no one who can compete with Bennett anymore.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He is also considering
bringing in a few of the more promising members of the fighting club as close
aides. If he gives them something in return, such as occasional hunting prey,
they will surely become obedient subordinates.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once everything is in
place, the next step is to crush the other entrance exam exemption groups
besides himself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Aside from Nina
Stingray, who was a mere facade, he would need to secure enough troops to fight
against the other powerful students. Instead of being in a rush, he must
formulate a plan over the long span of three years.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, he must first
have fun with the trembling girl in front of him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Without the
memory-sealing measures implemented by the headmaster, it would have been
absolutely impossible for him to hurt the daughter of the Stingray family. He
felt his brain's marrow go sweetly numb just thinking about how he was going to
cook the girl who had been so far protected by a powerful force.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... No more.
Please just stop."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The muttering, which
probably leaked out unconsciously, was slightly audible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina is not a fool.
She should have known that such a plea would be meaningless.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She fell to the ground
and was driven to the point where she had to cling to something meaningless.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why do you have
to be afraid? You'll forget everything anyway."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Daring to mobilize all
the gentleness in her, Bennett smiled at her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He knew from
experience that this expression was the most efficient way to strike fear into
someone's heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I will never
forgive you. Just imagine what would happen if you make an enemy out of the
Stingray family......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The sadistic side of
him was being stimulated even more.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You should have
understood by now. You'll forget everything. Even your anger toward me. How are
you going to snitch on me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When he was nearing
the end of his patience, he finally arrived at the front of the dormitory.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To the current
Bennett, the plain wooden door seemed like a gateway to paradise.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since it was weekends,
there might not be many students left, but right now he didn't want to run into
anyone. He didn't want anyone to tarnish his blissful moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He turned the doorknob
and opened the door toward him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He held the door and
urged Nina to enter, but she did not respond at all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps frozen by the
fear that had become so tangible, she remained motionless as she turned her
head toward the entrance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Come, hurry up
and get in. Your fate won't change anyway."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was no need to
wear the mask of a gentleman anymore.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett forced Nina to
her feet, kicked her in the back, and forced her to jump into the dormitory.
Then he closed the door and slowly followed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There, he finally
turned his attention to the entrance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Bennett instantly realized.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was frozen, not
because fear had taken over her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was simply stunned
by the bizarre scene that unfolded before her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">About 20 students had
gathered at the entrance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Their faces were
familiar. They were the participants of the &lt;tournament&gt; hosted by
Bennett. Emma Licorice, Jin's only remaining collaborator, was also there.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Most puzzling of all,
they all looked at Bennett with hostile eyes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............Ha?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What does this
mean?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Why are there
so many students here on the weekend?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the first
place, no one was here when we left the dorm a while ago.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And why are
they glaring at me?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He hurriedly turned to
look at Nina, but she was just as puzzled as he was.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her gaze was
completely dazed, and it was clear that she was so confused that she couldn't
take a step forward until someone provided her with an answer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In other words, Nina
was not involved in this situation at all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If so, then
who?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">On whose
orders were they brought together here?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Bennett-san
...... is this true?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Someone threw several
photos at Bennett's feet.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He felt his feet
becoming unsteady, as if he were on a board stretched over water. The mere act
of bending down to pick up the photos seemed terribly difficult at the moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He somehow managed to
pick up the photos and inspected them one by one.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">What was captured in the three photos was the most
intense hell.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Two boys were being
chased by a blazing fire puppet.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The screams that were
supposed to be trapped inside the photos were heard beyond the dimensional
barrier.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The figure laughing
while holding his stomach on the other side of the picture was undoubtedly
Bennett himself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".........Who?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett glared at all
the students gathered at the entrance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Who took these
photos?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I don't recall
letting anyone escape. Anyone who knew who was responsible for the C-rank hunt
should have been expelled from the academy.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Who the hell
is </span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The scam is
ninety percent successful once you've planted an assumption in their
minds."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The crowd split in
two, and the figure hiding in the back emerged.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Eyes the color of the
deepest part of the night, and an eerie smile that did not reveal his true
motives. A being foreign to everything in this country, including the color of
his skin - Jin Kirihara - is walking toward Bennett.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His clothes and skin
were stained with soot, and he had a fresh burn on his left shoulder, but no
matter how one interpreted it, he did not appear to be a dead man.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How did he
gather all these people?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When were
these photos taken?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, in the
first place, how is this guy ...... still alive?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Various questions come
flooding in like a wave, making it impossible to maintain a calm mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The only thing he knew
was that everything up till now had been nothing but a farce.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In other words, the
&lt;duel&gt; had no meaning whatsoever.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin did not have a
shred of hope that he would win.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His real objective was
to create this situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You lost,
Bennett. This is what happens when you fail to understand the board you're
supposed to be playing on."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's subordinates
were filled with despair and seething anger after being betrayed by the one
they had trusted. Emma, who seemed to have not quite grasped the full picture
of what had happened. Nina gazed at her accomplice, who had miraculously
survived, with an almost tearful look on her face. A couple of students at the
entrance of the dormitory were watching intently as they waited to see the
outcome as it unfolded.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, under all their
gazes, approached Bennett step by step.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Why are
you alive?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A tremor filled
Bennett's voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Surely, you
should have been engulfed by the flames!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, I wonder
why. Will you give me an earful once you know the answer?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At the moment the fire
that imitated a giant's arm attacked, Jin jumped into the pit that Nina had
also secretly prepared for him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It seemed as if he was
fleeing aimlessly, but Jin had been aiming only at that particular spot from
the beginning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">All he had to do was
crawl out of the hole while Bennett was distracted by Nina and get to the
student dormitory ahead of him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, Jin had no
intention of revealing such a simple trick.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, and it's not
just those photos I'd like to show you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin instructed a
nearby student to press the button on the playback device on the sofa at the
entrance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A rough sound peculiar
to magnetic tapes ran through the silent room.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Hahahahaha! Run, run!
If you don't run faster, my monster will devour you!]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Your memories will
disappear anyway. There is no way this torture will be a crime!]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Still not enough
....... The ones I killed in the past were more amusing.]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Oh, have you passed
out already? It's too soon this time. I'll have to find another target then. ......]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even without any
visual images, everyone present could vividly imagine Bennett's madness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The excessive amount
of violence, abusing the memory sealing measures of the expelled students.
Moreover, he even made a remark that implied a murder in the past.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Not to mention the
rules of society.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett Lohr is a true
villain.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Y-You
......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Looks like
you're suffocating. Do you perhaps need some oxygen? Oh, well, you've brought
this on yourself though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Just answer my
question, Jin! How did you know all about this!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, can I take
that as your confession? ...... Well, aside from me impersonating a police
officer, it was relatively early on that I realized that you were the C-rank
hunter. You know how Emma and I once attended a meeting you hosted? By that
time, I already had my suspicions."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't be
ridiculous! On what basis you-......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~, there's no
basis whatsoever."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin stated
nonchalantly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I just had a
hunch it was suspicious. There is no way that an elite with such a powerful
psychic ability would be doing charity work to help the weak. He must be doing
something very bad behind the scenes."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... For such
a vague reason."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm a skeptical
person after all. So I started my investigation after I first suspected that
the C-rank hunt was a staged act of your own making. If I was mistaken, I
thought if I apologized later, you'd forgive me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennet's expression
could be seen becoming distorted.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Was it anger or
despair that was swirling inside him?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"First, I looked
into your background."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin continued while
observing the other party's facial expressions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Bennett, you
were born into one of the largest landlords in the Ruskett region. Your father
seems to run a wide variety of farms and candle factories on his vast land. As
the only son of a wealthy man and possessing a powerful psychic ability, you
have had an arrogant personality since you were a child. You are the type of person
who wants everything to go your way. If we include the cases that your family
covered up, you had a bad reputation."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In truth, the order
was reversed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was six months
before the entrance examination that Gasta, who has contacts throughout the
country, made contact with a detective in the Ruskett region through an
intermediary. Jin, who believed that there was a &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; among
those who were exempted from the entrance examination, had already investigated
as much as possible about the profiles of all six students in advance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, it would be
more effective not to tell the other side of the story on this occasion.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Your true nature
is that of a genuine psycho who loves to dominate by force. There is no way
that a man like that would change his mind and devote himself to charity work
the moment he enters the academy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......How did
you get these photos?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett asked again,
no longer trying to mend anything, but Jin couldn't just answer that question.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Every time he looked
at those photos, Jin felt an unbearable dull ache in his chest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was the kind of
pain he would have to carry for the rest of his life.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">First, Jin made
contact with several of the C-rank students surrounding Bennett. If Bennett
wanted to make his men more unified, more willing servants, he would first
choose one of them as a target for the hunt.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If someone close to
them were to be the casualty, the threat would become more tangible. All that
remained was for a powerful leader to create a virtual enemy and show them a
countermeasure that they might be able to employ, and the weak would feel
vaguely relieved.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This is a technique
often used in state-sponsored brainwashing programs. Bennett used it without
even realizing it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As Jin probed the
inner workings of the situation, he came across a pair of individuals who were
likely to be his next targets.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Both were students who
harbored distrust of Bennett's methods and had the potential to become
insurgents if left unchecked.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At the time, it was
the perfect time to eliminate any future uncertainties without being perceived
as an example to the others. Besides, bringing two rebellious students to their
knees was just the kind of thing a sadist like Bennett would love to do.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So Jin offered them a
deal.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In exchange for a
large sum of money, he asked them to challenge Bennett to a &lt;duel&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although he had fully
explained the risks involved, the two students, who were originally tired of
competing for survival at the school, seemed to have made up their minds as
soon as Jin handed them the paycheck. They laughed and said that they might be
happier if they could go to an affiliated school with a large sum of money in
their hands.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As long as they knew
the date, time, and location of the &lt;duel&gt;, the rest was up to them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin, who was hiding in
the bushes, kept filming the whole thing after strapping a recording device to
a tree near the starting point.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The two were rescued
by a rescue team called by Jin, but were forced to stay in the hospital for
about a week. Bennett will never understand the frustration of having to simply
watch the scene of violence by heretics who have abandoned their hearts.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Having already lost
their memories of the school, they no longer remember the horror they felt at
that time. That's the only saving grace, Jin told himself over and over again.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">From that point on,
things went very smoothly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After obtaining the
evidence, Jin first asked Emma for her cooperation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett had 21 men
working for him. It would be impossible for Jin, who was being watched closely
by Bennett, to take any conspicuous action, such as contacting them one by one.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Therefore, Jin put a
copy of the evidence and a memo in an envelope with the following instructions:
[Meet at the dormitory at 1:10 p.m.], [Hide in another place until the time
comes so that Bennett will not know you are there], and [All the points taken
from Bennett will be divided among all of you].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma's communication
skills and kindness were the trump cards that would make the impossible
possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Looking at the current situation, it seems that my
decision was the right one.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin walked toward
Bennett and thanked the two students who had risked their lives to fish him
out, Emma for persuading Bennett's men, and the other 21 students who had made
the crucial decision.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You won't just
be expelled from the school. You're going to be handed over to the police as a
psychic with dangerous intentions. If you can think of a clever excuse, please
let me know."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's shoulders
slumped and all expression vanished from his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everyone present
thought that everything was now settled. The silence dissipated from the room
as the students, who had been watching the event, made a commotion.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the relaxed air,
only Jin was still keeping his guard up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The tension spread to
Nina, whose eyes suddenly met his, and a soundless exchange took place between
the two of them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Don't let your guard down. This is not over yet.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This man is still
looking for a way to turn the tables.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... You had
me fooled. I thought that your secret plan was to have insurance on the points
from the &lt;duel&gt; with Emma. At the very least, I thought it was a passive
measure to avoid expulsion from school. ...... I never thought you'd made my
men turn on me without my knowledge."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett, looking up,
had a half-moon smile on his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, there was no
emotion in his eyes. Although one could tell from the shape of his mouth that
it was a smile, there was no substance to it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Only a mortally broken
person could make such an expression.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I think you guys
did a great job. Certainly, the photos and recordings could be important
evidence. If they were submitted to the proper authorities, even I wouldn't be
able to get away with it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett remained
unperturbed in the slightest, despite the barrage of jeers telling him to stop
wasting his time and to surrender quietly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He has definitely
already figured out a way to turn things around.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Fine, I'll admit
it. I am indeed the mastermind of the C-rank hunt, the liar who brought all you
people together by forging an imaginary enemy for myself. The statements I'm
spouting in the recording about the murders are true as well. Well, it was an
accident though, and I wasn't even arrested for it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's the
matter? Have you suddenly opened your eyes? Are you fed up with your life all of
a sudden?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Stop puffing on
air, Jin. You do realize it, don't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't know
what you're talking about."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"A~, don't play
dumb with me. You should know that all this evidence is meaningless. It doesn't
matter how accurate your claims are. </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Because, I have the power to obliterate all of you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With that last word,
the entrance was suddenly engulfed in chaos.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No way, no sane person
would ever do such a thing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Killing everyone here
would be nothing short of a demonic act</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But they are aware of
it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They are aware of
Bennett's madness as recorded in the photos and in the audio tapes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They know the man in
front of them smiled, a smile so distorted that it was almost inhuman.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The maximum
firepower of the &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt; is 1200 °C. A human body
would be easily reduced to charcoal. Do you know what that means? No one will
be left behind, not even a trace, and disappear from this world. Who can prove
my murder when there is nobody to prove it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Can you really
do such a thing? You're just acting though ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As Jin said this, he
knew it was impossible to defeat Bennett with logic.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There is nothing more
powerful than a negotiation with a hint of insanity and violence.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He doesn't even really
need to kill all of them. Just burn a few as an example and then offer everyone
else the escape route of being expelled from school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The mere concern that
Bennett might really decide to go through with the massacre would prevent
anyone from even coming to the negotiating table.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What is truly
troubling is not the ability to summon a flame-clad monster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is the ability to
play the "foul card" - the power of negotiation to move everything at
will, which is reserved for those with overwhelming power - that has allowed
Bennett to reign supreme until now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No matter how many
tricks and elaborate lies he may concoct to drive his opponents into a corner,
a powerful opponent will always be able to regain the upper hand at the end of
the game.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If the entire board is
destroyed, there is nothing the weak can do.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"T-There is
another witness here, you know!?" Someone shouted in anguish. "Murder
can't be tolerated. Isn't that right?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[What are you bastard
talking about?]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The tin doll's
inorganic eyes were looking up into the middle of nowhere.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[I'm only here to oversee
the rules of the &lt;duel.&gt; I don't give a shit if you guys get killed or
not.]</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... That's
how it is, guys. Do you finally understand? In this school, strength is
everything. Justice and truth mean nothing in the face of psychics. All of you
who were born weak have no choice but to become my food."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Without any
preliminary movement, Bennett called out five fireballs in front of him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fireballs kept
growing at a rapid pace, transforming into five puppets. The fact that the
flames did not spread to the floor on which the fireballs were stepping on told
everyone that they were beings beyond human knowledge.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This school is a
miniature of the world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">People born with

who are cast out of the system.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That's why Jin as a
child had to stand on the street with a tin box in his arms.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That's why Rusty had
to fight the world alone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That's why Nina had to
shed tears in front of the fountain at that time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course,
you're the first one I'm going to kill, Jin. I'm telling you, this is not a
threat. I will definitely kill you. I will not even allow you to escape by
suicide. I will put my own pride on the line and make sure you are
obliterated."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The five &lt;
Executioners of Immolation&gt; all bent down at once. They seemed to be ready
to leap at once, their bodies bent down like a spring.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At the edge of Jin's
vision, Nina was shouting something.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was probably
saying something along the lines of, "give up on everything and run
away".</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">But still, Jin did not move.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He has a fierce smile
on his face, his eyes wide with joy and excitement, welcoming the madness of
this game.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"You both, are
monsters</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina muttered quietly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Indeed. Jin was not
sane from the beginning.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The very idea of a
mere human being trying to fight monsters with nothing but lies and trickery is
insane. It was as if he was enjoying a thrill from the bottom of his heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If there is an
existence that can compete with Bennett's demonic power, it is probably only a
monster with a mind like Jin's.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So Nina decided not to
look away any longer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As an accomplice, as a
friend who would deceive the world together, she decided to face the
consequences head-on.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Now, be
obliterated!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's signal
triggered the five monsters to fly out like bullets.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Scorching the
atmosphere, the puppets spread their arms and legs to their fullest. It would
be impossible for anyone to survive, let alone avoid the first blow.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Hot winds pounded into
his entire body.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Hot enough to cause
burns even without direct contact.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The presence of death
has increased in density to the point of inducing dizziness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Beyond that, Bennett's
distorted smile was visible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin held up his right
hand in front of him with an expression of acceptance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Disappear."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Engulfed by the fire,
Jin let out a desperate scream. In a short time, he ceased to exist, and was
transformed into an ugly burnt corpse. Bennett looked satisfied and began to
search for the next victim among the surviving students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That was the ending
that everyone was prepared for, however, did not become a reality.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moment the
onrushing &lt;Executioners&gt; attempted to touch Jin, everything was
transformed into nothingness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">An army of terrifying monsters,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">the radiant heat that
was produced as a side effect,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">as well as the dense
madness that filled the entrance,</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">disappeared as if
nothing had ever existed in the first place. There was nothing left but
silence, as if everything had been nothing more than an illusion.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the stillness of
the world, someone's muttering echoed through the air.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Did he nullify,
the psychic ability ......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">People with psychic
abilities tend to possess an independent physical law within themselves.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It has been considered
impossible to interfere with it from the outside, as evidenced by scientific
research that has barely made any progress in this subject.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What Jin has just
accomplished is a supernatural phenomenon that directly contradicts such
beliefs.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even in the Heiberg
Academy, where monsters abound, no one has ever heard of anyone being able to
nullify another person's psychic abilities.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Son of a b*tch,
how ......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh~,
Bennett-kun. Looks like this time you've completely lost your composure."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin slowly approached
Bennett, who was kneeling with a pale expression on his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everyone could only
watch the outcome without saying anything.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"So what was it
again? If we all get obliterated, everything will be resolved. What kind of
thought process could have made you believe in such a thing?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Like a prison guard
making an ominous sentence to a criminal, Jin concluded in a voice devoid of
warmth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're finished,
heretic. You were not worth deceiving."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett clutched his
own head as he was pummeled with a defeat so merciless that it was so perfect,
leaving no loophole prepared for him at all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His reaction was also
already anticipated by Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There is no way that a
man who has only known nothing but life as a victor could endure such a
decisive humiliation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Uuuuu............"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Having run out of
options, Bennett's last choice was to throw everything away and run away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett managed to get
to his feet and walked unsteadily, like a terrified child, toward the door.
However, his escape route was completely cut off.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina Stingray stood in
front of the door with her arms crossed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you running
away now after everything you've done, Bennett-san?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... A,
a."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even the person who
had once proved to be a fake would have looked like a monster to Bennett, who was
in a state of emotional breakdown.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's smile was so
contorted that it had a hint of death in it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a slow movement,
Nina removed the brooch attached to her chest.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moment Nina
Stingray removed the brooch, her previously sealed psychic ability was
released. A true monster is born, one that destroys everything around it
indiscriminately.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A rumor that had been
spreading throughout the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The first lie that Jin
and Nina made up together.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The red gleam of the
jewel in her hand seemed to be the most sinister thing Bennet had ever seen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Isn't it
exciting, Bennett-san? I wonder how long you can keep your sanity."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Something that was
created in the shape of a human being by an ominous being that transcends human
knowledge</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">──</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina pasted a smile so
fierce that everyone present felt it, and reached out her hand to Bennett, who
hung his head.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was as if she was
trying to crush his defenseless head.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Anyone who
doesn't want to die, get down!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her accomplice, who
had accurately read Nina's intention, raised his voice.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After confirming that
everyone's eyes were turned away from her, Nina kicked the floor and leaped
into the air.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her right leg, swung
out horizontally, precisely caught the temple of the defenseless Bennett.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was no way that
Bennett, who was in a state of disarray, could have remained conscious after
the impact to the side of his head. Looking down at the fainted monster, Nina
laughed dryly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Huh, are
you broke already?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............ Did
we win?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As Emma muttered this,
a wave of cheers erupted as if a dam had been broken.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everyone shouted words
of gratitude to Jin and Nina and celebrated the miracle of still being alive.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Looking around, the
tin cat that had witnessed the &lt;Duel&gt; was already gone. It must be that
once its job was done, it had no interest in the other students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Amidst the clamor,
Nina looked for Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The person who was
supposed to have saved everyone was walking toward someone's room in the back,
completely out of sight. The students didn't seem to realize that the main
character, Jin, was gone, and they didn't seem to pay any attention to his
direction.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina asked Emma, who
was nearby, to keep Bennett restrained, and then chased after Jin, who was
leaving the joyous crowd unnoticed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Wait!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was all
fine until I was about to call him out, but then what exactly should I say to
him?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina felt that neither
expressing gratitude nor smiling at him in celebration of his victory would be
appropriate.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What words
should I say to my accomplice after the battle?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the drawn-out
moment, it was Jin who opened his mouth first.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I was vaguely
aware halfway through the fight, but it seems that Bennett was a miss. A
dangerous person who runs amok and tries to massacre students can't possibly be
a &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But it wasn't a
waste of time. We were able to save everyone by defeating Bennett."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... It's not
that I wanted to save anyone..."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Indeed, his original
purpose might have been to snuff out the headmaster's spies.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But in the end, Jin
still went out of his way to protect everyone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It's obvious in his
grim expression, which is clearly fake.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina finally found the
right words to say.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............
Thanks for your hard work, Jin."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No more words are
needed right now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She wants to hug him
and grasp the joy of him being alive, but she holds back on that as well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Because Jin had been
fighting beyond his limits for a long time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if he wears an
apathetic expression and a composure that makes him look like he is
manipulating everything, it does not change the fact that he is just a human
being.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The burn on his left
shoulder is obviously painful, and she doesn't want to imagine the intense pain
of being repeatedly burned by fire.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, Nina decided
to say a few words to Jin, who had fought so desperately.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'll go patch
you up later. Please leave your room unlocked."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~, no need, no
need. I'll get better after I sleep."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I know that. So,
I'll just do it on my own."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">His battle would
continue. He could not let anyone see him endure the pain with greasy sweat on
his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Only I should know
such weakness.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina clenched her
fists in secret as she watched his back disappear behind the door.</span></span></p><p class="sc-bdvvtl">
