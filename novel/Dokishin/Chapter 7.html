<h3>Chapter 7: Farewell in the Rain, the Moon Setting in the Abyss of Night</h3>

<p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina gently
placed her hand on the shoulder of a male student who was backing away from
her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She won by a
thirty-second margin. Jin might have complained that it wasn't enough, but she
wished he would praise her for getting through it with only her slow and fluent
speech and her mysterious atmosphere.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As usual,
countless eyes were on Nina as she exited the gymnasium.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And that's why
his figure caught her attention right away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin was
sitting alone by the bushes, far away from the waiting students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">One could tell
without even confirming it. He was defeated by Bennett. He was utterly defeated
and plunged into the depths of despair.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A thought
crossed her mind, "Should I call out to him?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Then, a moment
later, she was struck with a pang of guilt and self-loathing that made her want
to disappear.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">After what I had done, I had no right to say anything.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina turned
away from her accomplice in despair and walked down the path leading to the
classroom building.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In her ear,
someone with the same voice as hers questions her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Was that really the right thing to do?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Was there no other option?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Am I able to show my current self to my sister, who
has been banished from the Stingray family?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Shut up!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Be gone.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I'd rather my ego disappear than hear these questions
whispered to me.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But this is
the end that Nina herself has chosen. There is absolutely no room for regret.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Footsteps
approaching from behind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Because she
had closed her mind, Nina's reaction was delayed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her thin arm
was grabbed from behind, and fear ran down her spine like an electric current.
She hurriedly turned around to see a pale-faced Jin standing there.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A frozen
voice, devoid of any sense of temperature, slammed into her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
You've done it, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What are
you talking about?" Somehow she managed to keep her composure. "Get
your hands off me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't
play dumb with me. I know you have connections with Bennett."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're
not making any sense."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Objectively
speaking ...... with my skills, there's no way anyone could have found out
about the matchbox swap. I can only assume that someone leaked the plan in
advance."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Like I said, get your hands off me. You're hurting me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You and
I were the only two who knew about the plan. Unless I'm so foolish as to reveal
that information to the enemy in my sleep, then with a simple process of
elimination, you're the only one who could be the traitor."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Amidst the
pain in his tightening hands, she noticed that Jin no longer called her by her
name.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Their
accomplice relationship will never be the same.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Naturally.
Because she had done something that deserved it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I
guess I was a fool for trusting you. I should have learned enough when I was a
kid not to trust anyone."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina almost
screamed when she heard Jin say that so sorrowfully.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Anger was
already gone from Jin's face. He was too devastated to care about such
feelings.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... I
had no choice but to do this."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, that's not it.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I must not utter such unscrupulous lines.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I must be more thorough and throw out words that will
decisively hurt Jin.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Say it, quick.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Don't worry about it, even if it means I'll never be
able to forgive myself.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Breaking
through the emotional restraints, Nina hurled a sentence that was clothed in
determination.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You
shouldn't be in a place like this. You should pack your belongings and go back
to your hometown and look for another way. You shouldn't be dreaming about
becoming a psychic. You hear me? You're out of place here, so get out of here.
...... please."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She could no
longer look him in the face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina
forcefully shook off the hand that grabbed her arm and ran towards the student
dormitory.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There have
been many times when she suffered so deeply, so severely that she was unable to
stand up.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, this
suffering was unusual.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even though
she had hurt someone so deeply, she was not strong enough to live her life
pretending as if nothing had happened.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There would be
no one to whom she could confide the pain that swirled inside her anymore.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had just
cut it off with her own hands.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By the time
she realized it, Nina's vision was blurred with tears.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She looked up
with wet eyeballs to see a slightly blurred halo floating around a street lamp.
The almost illusionary sight seemed to ironically reflect her stormy mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, she
noticed a shadow in the direction she was going.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although he
was supposed to be wearing the same uniform as everyone else, Bennett's figure
exuded elegance. It was something that Nina could not possess without putting
on the act.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">I wish I could be like him</span></i><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">, Nina thought.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If only I were loved by the world's system, without
suffering.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It would be better if I could be a real monster.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You
needn't feel bad about it, Nina."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I
don't know what you're talking about."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What you
did to Jin Kirihara was not a betrayal."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unpleasant
moisture clung to her long hair. It might be raining soon.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"This is
a race for survival to become a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt;, Nina. You
are someone who must aim high. To fly high, you have to detach yourself from
your bulky baggage. You did the right thing for your own cause."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm
sorry, but I'm not in the mood to stand around and talk right now. Shall we
head back to the dorms early, before it rains?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre38">"Listen, it's
not your fault."</span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's
words certainly had a sincere ring to them.</span></span></p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Senki/bw7.jpg">

<p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You are
just too kind, you were deceived by that man, you know? In other words, it was
self-defense when you gave me the information. Besides, there was always the
option of not giving me the information. If that still doesn't make you feel
better, I'm always willing to listen."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Why are
you going to such lengths for me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Because
we are comrades."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Yup, it's not
him after all.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina felt
hopeless.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett is
certainly a good person. He has a genuine sense of justice, he is in the race
for survival with a genuine motive, and it's not just anyone who can provide a
training opportunity for C-rank students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Yet he is
incapable of understanding Nina's pain.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He cannot
understand the horror of being a mere human thrown into the home of monsters.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Have you thought about the alliance I told you about before?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm
sorry, can you wait a little longer?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'll
wait as long as I have to. We have plenty of time."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".............Thank
you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As Nina
watched Bennett waving his hand in perfect gesture as he walked away, she was
struck by the illusion of a thick wall of ice closing in on her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The ominous
words "eternal solitude" appeared on the surface of the wall.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">From now on,
until the moment when all lies are exposed and she is punished, Nina must
continue to play the farce by herself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Still, she had
no choice but to do this to save Jin from his desire for destruction.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had to do
this in order to keep the smile on his face when he showed her the lemon trick.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"...... A</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">ãƒ¼</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">a, I've finally found it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Someone to
whom she could expose all her secrets. An accomplice whom she could trust with
all her heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina blushed
as she realized that she had voiced her feelings as they were. But perhaps it
was an unnecessary worry.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The rain was
getting stronger, so surely no one would have heard her talking to herself like
this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">â—†</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett was
able to make it to the dorm before the rain began to fall heavily.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As he stepped
into the entrance, he found several male students waiting for him. They look
like squires who serve their masters, Bennett chuckled inwardly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Bennett-san,
would you like to have a meal ......?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh,
thank you as always. Can you bring it up to my room, please?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He felt bad
for the students who were running to the cafeteria in a hurry.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although he
didn't remember asking for it, the members of the competition group came to
take care of Bennett's personal needs.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Waving to
them, Bennett went to his room alone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He turned on
the light in his room and sat down on the comfy sofa by the window. There was a
candle on a platter on the table, but it had completely melted because he had
left the room without extinguishing it. There were still some in stock, but it
might be time to have them sent from his parents' house.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everything is
going well, he thinks.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was
exempted from the entrance exam and was able to enter the Heiberg School, and
the management of the fighting competition, which he had envisioned from the
beginning, is progressing well.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They are
sometimes ridiculed as C-rank students, but they are still psychics even if
they are incapable.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since he has
so many people with the qualities to become human weapons in his ranks, it is
safe to say that the foundation for survival in this school has already been
completed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Haha."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Since no one
is in the room, there is no need to put on an act.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Therefore,
there is no need to stifle the laughter that rises up from the depths of his
throat.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hahahahahahaha!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Subordinates
who are humble toward their classmates, those who think that the competition is
just a charity event, and the adults who created the flawed school system are
all irredeemably stupid.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even at the
academy, where promising psychics are gathered from all over the country, the
end result is the same as the previous 15 years. For Bennett, who is destined
from birth to rise above the rest, it would be too easy to turn this place into
his own kingdom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They are too
stupid to know what Bennett is doing behind the scenes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They have no
idea that the [C-rank hunt] that gave him the excuse to organize the
competition is actually being carried out by Bennett himself.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He has already
beaten up and expelled five students for both pleasure and benefit.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett
replayed the blissful moment on the back of his eyelids.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The prey are
chased by the [Executioner, of Immolation], screaming and scurrying through the
forest at night.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The screams of
the losers, caught alive in the fire, as if they were spitting out their entire
existence.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After all, Bennett
believes, the adults who created the school system are the villains.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even the level
of torture prohibited by the laws of war is affirmed here. The reason is that
as soon as the expulsion is confirmed, the victims are put into a hypnotic
state and their memories of the school are sealed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Above all, the
cat doll made by the principal which was present at the &lt;Duel&gt; that
Bennett has arranged for his pathetic victims is useless.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the
academy, any kind of criminal act is allowed. Perhaps even killing people.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After all,
that is how the world is.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">All is
forgiven to the strong. It is affirmed to eat, hurt, and dominate the weak.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Well, only that guy, I have to crush him as soon as possible."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin Kirihara.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A confident man who tries to win Nina over with his
hubris, even though he has no ability. If such a foolish daydreamer were to be
destroyed, no one would have any desire to oppose me.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, I have no intention of killing him, but it
won't be a problem if I inflict a few lasting scars on him. His memories will
be erased anyway, so everything can be treated as an unfortunate accident.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After that, it would be my turn to finally get my
hands on Nina.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I don't like women who don't seem to be used to
playing around, but she is more than worth using to solidify my position in the
kingdom. There should be no particular inconvenience in making her fall in love
with me.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So far, I've gotten everything I've wanted.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This time is no different. All of this is nothing but
a boring game.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The door to
the room was knocked again.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It should be
too early for his subordinates to come back from the cafeteria.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Who is it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Without
waiting for his permission, the person opened the door and entered the room.
Since he forbade his subordinates to enter the room without his permission, we
could guess who it was right away.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Oh, if it isn't Jin. Your room is not supposed to be here though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin gave off
no hint of elegance, but was as cunning as a hungry wild animal. His black,
stagnant eyes that were framed by slanted slits appeared bizarre.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A few moments ago, I should have already utterly
crushed this man a few hours ago.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If so, then what is the true nature of this tenacious
atmosphere?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
come to ask for a &lt;duel&gt;. Of course, I'll bet all my points on it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Are you serious?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In any case,
he was intending to have a &lt;duel&gt; with Jin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Like the other
victims, he was going to summon the [Executioner of Immolation] and make it
absolutely impossible for him to refuse, and then force him to sign a written
pledge.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, he
had never expected that Jin would come to him instead. This man had lost Nina,
and he was supposed to be in a completely devastated situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Is it possible that he has become desperate?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">â”€</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">No, there was no way
this confident man would challenge me to a fight he had no chance of winning.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He must be plotting some sort of scheme. Just as he
had done before when he switched the matchbox in the &lt;Chase Tag&gt;.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett
somehow managed to mask his discomfort and spoke in a friendly tone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You
gotta chill out. ...... How many points do you own now, anyway? Even if you
said you'd bet it all, it's just a small amount for me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But if
you lose to me, your position will collapse instantly."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I won't
fall for your cheap provocations. First of all, there is no advantage for me in
fighting against you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett was
spinning his thoughts at high speed, pretending to be unaffected.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How should I play the cards in my hand to see through
his plan and crush him?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No, that alone would not be enough.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How could I inflict the maximum amount of pain and
humiliation on him so that he would beg for forgiveness himself?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To erase this
unbearable discomfort, he relentlessly thought to that extent.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wouldn't
it be humiliating for you to run away from a challenge from a C-rank
student?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You are
quite persistent, huh? Don't tell me you already prepared for another cheat for
this one?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Will you
stop making accusations? No one is as innocent as I am."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett felt a
sweet numbness fill his entire body.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I see, this is not just a battle to burn down my
opponent with my psychic abilities. It is a battle of wits in which I must
defeat a cocky guy who pretends to be a schemer by using greater trickery than
he is capable of. On the day of the &lt;Duel&gt;, as soon as we face each
other, the winner has already been decided.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">â”€â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Interesting.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moment he
became calm, cruel ideas rushed through his brain like an electric current.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
It can't be helped. I'll accept."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I think I'm a heck of a villain to be able to come up with
such a strategy.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I must hurry back to the more serious conversation
before I can't hold my laughter any longer.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"In
exchange, I'll set the date and place."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
fine. That's your right."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You seem
to be enjoying this. Do you know what will happen to you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Who
knows? Will you please enlighten me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett's
futile efforts to prevent him from taking control of the conversation brought
tears to his eyes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin still
didn't know anything.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just three
days ago, Bennett had managed to crush two C-rank students just like Jin. He
was not aware that Bennett was a monster who could use malice and trickery even
more than he could.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What kind of
expression will Jin have on his face when he is shown the difference in power
and burnt in the fire of disappointment and humiliation?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After Jin
left, Bennett gulped down a glass of water and looked out the window at the
night world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moon,
which had been shining so beautifully yesterday, had now set behind thick rain
clouds.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It looked as
if it was mocking the poor man who had been cut off from all hope.</span></span></p>
