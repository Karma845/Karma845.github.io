<h3>Chapter 3.html</h3>

<p>My first impression when I entered the city of Crossroads was that the roads were wide.<br />
Was it because of the carriages coming and going?<br />
The wide cobblestone road and the buildings to the left and right were all made of heavy stone.<br />
The people who came and went all looked like Westerners, and their clothes were like those European folk costumes I’d seen on the TV and Internet.</p>
<p>[Hey, can you stop standing around there?]</p>
<p>[Oh, I&#8217;m sorry]</p>
<p>Of course, since I was in the middle of the street, some people would find me in their way, so I moved to the side and observed the people and surroundings.<br />
There were various people who came and went, but it seemed that most of them carried some kind of weapon on their waists.<br />
Aside from really small children, even children around 12 to 13 years old carried something like a knife.<br />
The only people who were not equipped with weapons are those who wore black leather collars. Are those the slave?<br />
As far as I could see, the streets were clean and I didn&#8217;t smell any strange odors. I wonder if the water and sewage systems were in good condition.</p>
<p>[Oh, I&#8217;m sorry. Where is the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild?]</p>
<p>[Oh, it&#8217;s right there. You see, that wooden building.]</p>
<p>When I stopped a decently good looking aunt who seemed to be on her way home from shopping and asked her, she immediately told me.<br />
There was certainly a nice wooden building sitting in the place where the aunt pointed.</p>
<p>[Thank you sister.]</p>
<p>[Ahhh! You&#8217;ll be a good Adventurer! Good luck!]</p>
<p>Perhaps she was happy with my compliment, she laughed and waved as she left.<br />
Alright, let&#8217;s head in right away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>Adventurer&#8217;s Guild.<br />
It was indispensable for fantasy settings.<br />
A place where adventurers asked for requests, gathered information, and set out on adventures.<br />
An important existence that served as a hub for all that, the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild.<br />
The adventurer&#8217;s Guild in this world was probably the same as I thought it would be.<br />
In the building, rough-looking people wearing various weapons gathered, looking at the request forms posted on the bulletin board and winding pipes at the attached bar.</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>[Welcome to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild. New face, request?]</p>
<p>[No, it&#8217;s registration]</p>
<p>When I said that, the reception counter Ossan (one that was balding too) began to look at me from the toes to the top of my head.<br />
I&#8217;m not happy to be leered at by an Ossan, don&#8217;t look over here.</p>
<p>[Well, your physique isn&#8217;t bad, but&#8230; will you be okay with just that equipment?]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay, no problem.<br />
I already knew what I wanted to say.<br />
It wouldn&#8217;t make sense to tell this story.</p>
<p>[I can do swords, hand-to-hand fighting, and wind magic reasonably well. I can use a little recovery magic. I was thinking of preparing the equipment, but how much does it cost to get the minimum armor?]</p>
<p>[Well, well. You’re actually quite versatile regardless of appearance. If you want leather armor, it&#8217;s probably about eight silver coins.]</p>
<p>My current balance was one gold coin, two large silver coins, eight silver coins, thirteen large copper coins, and twenty copper coins.<br />
I understood that it was quite expensive, but it hadn&#8217;t come to penny pinching yet.</p>
<p>[Can you recommend an armor shop for a budget buyer?]</p>
<p>[Sure, I&#8217;ll tell you later about an armor store that is affiliated with us. But register first. Please, give me your ID.]</p>
<p>[Is this okay?]</p>
<p>When I showed him the temporary ID card issued at the town gate earlier, the Ossan nodded when he saw it.<br />
After that, I received detailed questions and explanations about the rules in a separate room.<br />
The detailed rules were like common sense.<br />
Don’t make a fuss using weapons and magic while inside the city, help each other as much as possible, but killing each other in general was prohibited.</p>
<p>[Something like that, and now all that’s left is the aptitude test.]</p>
<p>[Aptitude test?]</p>
<p>After about thirty minutes of explanation, Ossan said that.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t heard that there was a test, wait.<br />
I would be done if it turned out to be a written test.</p>
<p>[Yeah, come over here]</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>I was brought into a place like a large training ground.<br />
There was a space for training bows and swords and body fitness. Adventurers could spend their time as they wished here.<br />
Gazes were focused on me since Ossan took me here. Please ignore me.</p>
<p>[Okay, I&#8217;ll have you fight a suitable guy here&#8230; Hmm.]</p>
<p>Ossan looked around.<br />
The number of adventurers who were curious and watching this situation was increasing.<br />
Hey, stop fooling around in the guild building. Cut it out.</p>
<p>[OK, Ethan, come forward.]</p>
<p>An Adventurer nominated by Ossan walked in.<br />
A young male adventurer wearing worn-out leather armor.</p>
<p>[Is this the weapon?]</p>
<p>An adventurer called Ethan tossed one of the two wooden swords he brought at me. Obviously training swords.<br />
I caught and swung it a few times. not bad.</p>
<p>[Please hold it for me for a bit.]</p>
<p>I gave the short sword to the adventurer who was nearby and did a bending and stretching exercise.<br />
Since it came to this, I will do as much as I could.</p>
<p>[Am I allowed to use magic?]</p>
<p>[As long as you don’t end up killing someone.]</p>
<p>In other words, anything goes as long as nobody dies.<br />
Ethan was holding a wooden sword in his hand, probably because he was ready.<br />
The betting over which one of us would win has already begun.</p>
<p>[Then, start the aptitude test, both sides get ready.]</p>
<p>Ethan held the wooden sword and entered a stance.<br />
I also entered a fighting stance so that I could move at any time.</p>
<p>A moment of silence.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>[Start!]</p>
<p>With Ossan&#8217;s shout, Ethan was closing the gap immediately.<br />
I also closed the gap in the same way.<br />
Ethan looked astonished for a moment, perhaps because he thought I was an amateur.</p>
<p>[Ha!]</p>
<p>The first move was mine.<br />
My sword that aimed at the right arm was waved off by Ethan&#8217;s wooden sword, and the swing down from the upper row that Ethan had released hit empty air because I took half a step back.<br />
Swing down, shave off, counter, hang up, and tie up with Ethan for a while.<br />
I’m doing okay. I can react properly. I can win this.<br />
Is it due to impatience? Ethan raised his sword up for a whole body down swing.<br />
Seeing this as an opportunity, I received the swing down with the belly of the sword supported by both hands, and gave a strong front kick to Ethan&#8217;s undefended torso.<br />
A certain feeling told me it was sloppy.</p>
<p>[Guho!]</p>
<p>I pointed my left index finger to where Ethan receded backwards.<br />
My magical power converged, enough for three shots.<br />
Then, I launched the magic while imagining three air bullets.</p>
<p>[Wind shot!]</p>
<p>The air bullets fired in three consecutive shots struck and blew off Ethan, who had not regained his posture.</p>
<p>&#8230;?</p>
<p>The training ground fell silent for a moment.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t move with my fingertip that was pointing at Ethan.<br />
Did I overdo it?<br />
What’s with this silence?</p>
<p>[That’s gonna do it.]</p>
<p>The Ossan grinned and laughed.<br />
Ethan who fell down was dragged to the corner by some of the adventurers who were watching.</p>
<p>[Who will go next?]</p>
<p>Adventurers started to swarm in front of me with wooden weapons in hand.<br />
Oi, so many of them.</p>
<p>[The good ones have come in.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[I have to taste this.]</p>
<p>[Why don&#8217;t you do it?]</p>
<p>Please stop, I will die.</p>
<p>[Aren&#8217;t you very popular?]</p>
<p>I felt murderous at the Ossan who laughed at me merrily.<br />
Because this Ossan was amused, I was forced to deal with three more people.<br />
The result? I lied on the floor, exhausted and battered, along with 3 more people who fainted with my training sword.<br />
It might have been a little different if my magic power hadn&#8217;t run out.</p>
<p>[Did I pass?]</p>
<p>[Oh, sure. You passed without problem. Normally, you’ll start out from F rank, but I’ll assign you to E rank.]</p>
<p>That said, the metal card he gave me was engraved with my name and face, as well as the letter &#8220;E&#8221; to indicate the adventurer&#8217;s rank.<br />
There was no particular description about the level.<br />
The concept of ‘levels’ wasn’t too deep.</p>
<p>[Isn&#8217;t it good to rank up?]</p>
<p>Since my magical power had recovered a little, I cast healing magic on my aching head.<br />
I acted a little lax since the Ossan had lost a good level of respect in my eyes.<br />
After all, he did some outrageous things like urging adventurers to go against me who didn&#8217;t even wear armor.</p>
<p>[Well, if you reach B rank, you&#8217;ll get a lot of attention. If you&#8217;re A rank, most people will look up to you, and if you&#8217;re S rank, you&#8217;ll be treated as a Hero.]</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s a long way away]</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s right, so do your best. Oh yeah, here is the address of the recommended armor shop I mentioned earlier.]</p>
<p>[Please tell me the recommended inn as well.]</p>
<p>I’ll consider you forgiven if you do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[Welcome.]</p>
<p>When I went to the armor shop introduced by the guild&#8217;s ossan, it seemed to be quite prosperous, as I could see several other adventurers were checking on the equipment.<br />
It was the woman at the counter who called out to me. A beautiful woman.<br />
Was it the smell of iron and leather? The inside of the store was full of unique scents that I had never smelled before.<br />
I took a look at the corner displaying leather armors.<br />
Although it was reinforced with studs and various parts were reinforced with sheet metal, it was expensive.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s important to choose your first armor, do you need help?]</p>
<p>I was called from behind, so I turned around and found the beautiful woman from the counter was standing there with a big smile on her face.<br />
Hmm? Looking more closely, I realized that she had pointy ears. Is she an Elf or something?</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[Oh, I&#8217;m Louise. I’m the clerk here, at your service 」</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m Taichi. I&#8217;m thinking of buying leather armor.]</p>
<p>[Hmm, which one]</p>
<p>Louise suddenly hugged my hand on her body.<br />
Our position now was spot on for me to look at her greenish silver hair.<br />
Ah, it has a nice scent――nonono. This feels somewhat immoral to do in a public area.<br />
I think there were some customers who were fond of Louise here.<br />
Their hot glares hurt.</p>
<p>[Hmm, what kind of design do you like for gauntlets and knee pads? Is it&#8217;s for this onii-san&#8217;s physique?]</p>
<p>[Uhm&#8230; I can do sword fighting and also hand-to-hand fighting, so I&#8217;d like something that suits it. Budget is within 9 silver coins in total ]</p>
<p>[In that case, it would be better to strengthen the fists, knees, and elbows with studs. It would be nice to strengthen the toes of the boots, but that would be a little over budget.]</p>
<p>[I don’t mind if it&#8217;s just a little.]</p>
<p>I looked through the armor while having such exchanges.<br />
Then, when I looked at the counter, there was a cat.<br />
No, it&#8217;s not an ordinary cat.<br />
A slender cat about the size of a human child. Was it a kind of beastkin?<br />
The cat was dexterously playing with something that looked like a smoke tube. Somehow dignified. I wonder if that was the owner, as Louise seemed to be in charge of customer service.<br />
Repeat fitting, adjusting, trying on, and adjusting the selected armor several times.<br />
After consulting with the budget, I decided to buy a set of leather armor that was reinforced with studs except for the torso area.<br />
9 silver coins and 6 large bronze coins.</p>
<p>[Yes, thank you. Do you also need a weapon perhaps?]</p>
<p>[Hmm, to be honest, I want one, but I don&#8217;t have the budget. I want a sword with a longer blade, but I can also use wind magic.]</p>
<p>[Well, if it&#8217;s for onii-san&#8217;s physique, a slightly longer sword would be fine. But magic? What kind of catalyst onii-san usually use?]</p>
<p>[Catalyst?]</p>
<p>I tilted my head upon hearing the unfamiliar term.<br />
Louise was laughing bitterly in disbelief.</p>
<p>[Is onii-san really a magic user? I heard that exercising magic without a trigger is not inefficient.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>With that said, Louise brought a wooden stick from the back of the store.<br />
It&#8217;s shaped like a drumstick.</p>
<p>[This is the cheapest catalyst in this shop. I don&#8217;t know the detailed principle, but it seems that it is quite different with and without the catalyst.]</p>
<p>I borrowed the catalyst from Louise and tried to activate a wind bullet.<br />
What did I think?<br />
It was difficult to express because it is a bit abstract, but it feels like I could &#8220;grab&#8221; the magic power moving through my body.<br />
The magic power that would spread without the use of a catalyst is now fixed in space.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s certainly easier, using this. Is the function integrated with the weapon?]</p>
<p>It would be impossible to fight with this drumstick-shaped wooden stick.<br />
Sword could easily cut it in two.</p>
<p>[There are some, but swords that can also act as catalysts are expensive though? If it&#8217;s cheap, I wonder if this suits you.]</p>
<p>With that said, Louise brought out a wooden stick that was a little longer than I was tall.<br />
It&#8217;s like a staff usually used in Chinese martial arts.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s a quarterstaff that can be used as a catalyst. In this case, 6 silver coins.]</p>
<p>[I bought a set of armor already, so can you at least give me a discount for the staff? Maybe about 4 silver coins.]</p>
<p>Louise looked at the cat at the counter to consult about my haggling.<br />
The cat gave something like a block sign.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how the cat managed with those paws, but I actually understood what it meant.</p>
<p>[Then, how about one gold coin and four silver coins together with a set of armor?]</p>
<p>That means I would still have 2 large silver coins, 4 silver coins, 13 large copper coins, and 20 copper coins in my balance.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;okay.</p>
