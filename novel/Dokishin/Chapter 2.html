<h3>Chapter 3: Secrets Told at the Fountain, Parties Won't Save Anyone</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The legend associated
with that girl began 10 years ago.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was five years old
at the time, and caused a [major incident] when she and her butler went hiking
in the mountains. As soon as she casually pointed to a mountain in the
distance, the slope collapsed with a tremendous noise, scattering mud and soil.
Since then, this innocent destroyer has accumulated numerous legends, and
before long, the name of Nina Stingray spread throughout the empire.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After all, the
misfortune of the three boys who challenged her to a fight just a few moments
ago was due to their doubts about the authenticity of the legend.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At first, it was
supposed to be just a little prank.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They provoked a famous
person who was exempted from the entrance exam, and then they showed everyone
around them that they were strong and unafraid of anything, and they took the
lead in the race for survival.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With the entrance
ceremony scheduled to begin in 20 minutes, they thought there was no
possibility of a battle breaking out, and even if it did, they were under the
illusion that the three of them would be able to handle it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It did not take long
for them to realize that this was a big mistake.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina looked at the three
of them as if she were sizing them up, and then muttered with a blank
expression on her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Do you truly
understand what it means to make an enemy of me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had beautifully
braided platinum-colored hair and azure eyes that shone like works of art. Even
her beauty was now nothing more than an element that accentuated the
disconcerting nature of the situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As if to suppress her
tremendous destructive impulse, Nina spoke on cautiously.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Every opponent
I've ever fought has had their limbs torn off, without exception."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The sun hid behind the
clouds, casting an ominous shadow on Nina's face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her azure eyes glowed
mysteriously as she unceasingly ogled the bodies of the three men. Her
fractured smile gave the impression of a definite lack of humanity as a living
creature.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The poor victims
instantly understood that there was no way they could talk to such a person.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Since it's pure
psychokinesis, there doesn't seem to be any particular means of resistance.
...... Ah, it's not that they were in the wrong, you know? It's just that I
still can't control my abilities very well. Of course, this time too, I will do
my best to prevent you all from being killed. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The three of them
stopped breathing as they cowered under the words that sounded as if it were
someone else's problem.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Now that I think
about it, it's strange that I've never been charged with a crime before. I
wonder why? Could it be because my father has such a strong influence on the
judiciary as well?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina turned around and
tilted her head like a child who doesn't understand how the world works.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No one could not help
but shudder watching the expressions on her face change from one second to the
next.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A monster with great
power, yet unstable and uncontrollable. Moreover, she has a powerful background
that can cover up her crimes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everyone present
understood that it was a big mistake to get involved with Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Three against one, you
say? What makes you so naive to think that you can compete against her?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">This monster is no
longer in their realm </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">────</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is an existence
like an inevitable disaster, advancing through the battlefield as if it were
taking a walk, producing countless corpses in its path.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is only her whim
that allows them to survive now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Shall we begin
then? At least let me have a little fun, okay?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a smile that did
not match her emotions, Nina held her palm out in front of her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The three of them were
in a state of panic, and in the next moment, they fell on their butts in
disgrace. They slumped and backed away, making meaningless pleas.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hiih~, help me!
Please help me!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's innocent
killing intent gushed out from her entire body, like a young child trampling on
ants. She turned to the three of them who were crawling away on the ground and
said as if proclaiming.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><br class="sc-5rbuj" /></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've memorized
your faces, gentlemen. I look forward to seeing you again."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When the auditorium
opened, Nina was guided by the instructor to the front row.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Only six students in
this year's grade were exempted from the entrance examination and were allowed
to sit in this section. Located at the bottom of the bowl-shaped auditorium,
this is where all eyes were on her from every possible direction.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nice to meet
you. Are you by any chance Nina Stingray?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, a male
student sitting in the chair next to her smiled at her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina squinted her
azure eyes and observed the good-looking boy. The expression on the boy's face,
who introduced himself as Bennett Rohr, already revealed a hint of intimacy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A high level of social
skills unique to people who have been educated from an early age as gifted
children. His slender stature and center-parted black hair exuded elegance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, having no choice
but to mobilize all of her social skills, smiled back at him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I was a little
surprised. I never knew there were so many psychics in my generation."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Even if it's
only one in a thousand, it's still not something one can easily perceive,
huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yes. There were
only a few of them living around me after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although the
percentage of people with psychic abilities among the number of births has been
increasing year by year, in Nina's generation it is only about 0.1% of the
total.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And most of them are
so impotent that they can never be utilized in combat or espionage operations.
It is not possible to reach the Heiberg Academy, which is the best school in
the country, with just the ability to float or bend a spoon a little bit.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The 278 new students
in this auditorium, from all over the empire and from various races, are some
of the most extraordinary monsters in the country.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"But it's a
pleasure to sit side by side with someone as famous as you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You think too
highly of me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Just a few
minutes ago, you fought off some students who tried to gang up on you, right?
It's becoming a hot topic of conversation all over the place."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I just repelled
some bugs that were flying around in front of me. It happens all the
time."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although she tried to
lightly intimidate him with her childlike expression, as if she did not know
the standards of right and wrong, Bennett only shrugged his shoulders and
smiled. As expected, the six people sitting in these special seats must be
exceptional among the monsters.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At the scheduled time,
the Heiberg School's entrance ceremony began.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After the opening
greetings, congratulatory speeches by officials and local dignitaries were
delivered at length. It seems that even the most prestigious educational
institution is no different from other schools when it comes to mediocre and
boring ceremonies like this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What was rather
strange was that the headmaster of the school, Jill Will Weiser, was still
nowhere to be seen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The young instructor
who was reading out the greeting instead explained that the headmaster was too
busy to attend the ceremony, but what could he possibly prioritize over the
entrance ceremony of the school he runs?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Everyone in the Empire
knows that he is quite an eccentric person, but not to this extent.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After that, the
ceremony proceeded smoothly, yet tediously. The students' drowsiness was
awakened when the entire program of the entrance ceremony was over and a female
instructor appeared on the stage.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Alright,
swine. That concludes our celebrations."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The beautiful female
instructor, who froze the air in the auditorium, began to look around at the
appalled students with her reptilian cold eyes behind her silver-rimmed
glasses.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After making sure all
the students' attention was focused on her, the female instructor opened her
mouth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm Isabella,
the person in charge of your school year. Pleased to meet you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Without so much as a greeting,
the cold-hearted words continued.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"First of all, I
would like to say to you, you miserable swines who are dreaming of a happy
student life here at Heiberg Academy, you'd better request to be expelled from
the school right now. Of course, it is all right to make friends and lovers,
but you must remember that this is not a mere educational institution."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the 30 years since
the end of the Great War, the number of Psychics has increased exponentially,
but their percentage of the country's total population is still tiny. Most of
them probably have never had anyone of the same generation with psychic
abilities around them before. That was why many of the students were so excited
to make new friends.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, the female
instructor's words reminded them of the reality of the situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"As we already
explained during the entrance exam, now let's review some of the basic rules of
the Heiberg School."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Then, the instructor
began to give them a brief explanation of the school's rules and regulations.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The explanation, which
took about 15 minutes, could be summarized as follows.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Rule No. 1 : Points are allocated to all students
according to their performance on the entrance exam.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Rule No. 2 : Points will be increased or decreased
according to the results of the &lt;practical exam&gt;, which is held at the
end of every other week.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Rule No. 3 : Five students with the lowest points on
the last day of each month will be expelled from the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Rule No. 4 : Students who receive zero points will be
expelled from the school before the last day of the month.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Rule No. 5 : Expelled students will have their
memories erased immediately.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The female instructor
did not bother to explain, but each student had a string of numbers floating in
their minds.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It seemed to be a mechanism
that enabled them to grasp their respective possession points intuitively by
simply thinking about it. This was probably due to the influence of the
suggestion the headmaster had given them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">According to the
female instructor's explanation, the points possessed by other students will be
posted on the information board in front of the classroom building every
Monday.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"By the way,
several outstanding students - the six students who were exempted from the
entrance examination - were given a uniform initial score of 1000 points. But
on the other hand, the lowest-ranked swine who took part in the &lt;Screening
Test&gt; will probably get less than 50 points on average. Do you know what
this means?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In other words, this
is what Isabella was trying to say.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">The first candidate to be eliminated has already been
decided.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina looked at the
handful of mud-covered students who were forced to stand at the top of the
auditorium.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While most of them
were overwhelmed with fear and anxiety, there was only one male student who was
welcoming the overwhelmingly unfavorable race for survival with a wry smile on
his face. His eyes, peeking through a gap in his disheveled black hair, glowed
with a vicious gleam.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Come to think of
it, I haven't told you about the other rule yet."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The female
instructor's cold words brought Nina back to her senses.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The sixth rule
is ......, you are allowed to have duels between students here. The students
involved are free to decide the rules and engage in a match."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The female instructor contorted
the edges of her mouth in a strange manner.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"In the
&lt;duel&gt;, each of you will wager the points that have been allocated to
you. Do you understand? This system is, in other words, a means of salvation
for the lowest-performing students."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A salvation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Many of the students
engraved these words deep in their hearts.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Indeed, this system
can be a trump card for those with low grades to survive in the school.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Students whose points
are set unfairly low at the time of admission are in danger of being expelled
from the school on a monthly basis. The points that can be earned in the
bi-weekly examinations are meager, and there is too little hope for students to
have only two chances each month to earn points in the first place.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nevertheless, with the
&lt;duel&gt; system in place, the possibility of overcoming these difficulties
increases.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The procedure

if someone forged his or her name on the form, the duel would be deemed to be
invalid."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't we have to

like that of a boy in the early transitional phase of his voice, or like that
of a woman who still had a childish voice. There were noises mixed in here and
there, and there was no intonation at all, so it was somewhat strange to hear a
voice coming from a real person.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was as if the
voices were forcefully merged together from the radio.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Ah!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A female student who
was sitting a little behind seemed to have noticed something. Like the other
students around her, Nina also looked in the direction she was pointing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In front of the
podium, a tin doll in the shape of a cat stood on two legs.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[Have you finally

that Jake was probably in charge of monitoring the students' abilities.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The school values this

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was an hour to
spare before orientation would begin in each classroom. Nina arrived in front
of a fountain that stood quietly away from the classroom building.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The ring-shaped
fountain was completely dried up, and moss was growing all over the concrete,
indicating that it had been abandoned for some time. Perhaps it was a mistake
to build the fountain in such an inconspicuous place in the first place.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She sat down on a
bench facing the fountain and let out a small sigh.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... I guess
my life is similar."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After making sure that
no one was around, Nina took out an object from her bag that was about the size
of her pinky finger.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was a cute little
doll in the shape of a rain frog, dressed in a suit lavishly decorated with
sequins. It was the only precious thing she had ever owned, given to her by her
older sister when she was a child.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina let out her
emotions for the first time today as she held the rain frog doll in her palm.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I don't

way she was going to get a response from the expressionless frog, she went on
regardless.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The person who
came up with this school system is really insane! As a student, one is supposed
to be active in studies and sports! Just what the heck is a &lt;duel&gt; even
for!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With this doll, she
could speak her true feelings, which she could not let anyone in the world
hear. The mask she always wore in public was completely peeled off.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"The students are
all upper-class elites! I'm exhausted! I should have refused to attend school
right away!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She couldn't imagine
spending three years in such an abnormal environment. Of course, there were no
guarantees that she would still be alive in this school in three years' time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">No, I have to accomplish it no matter what it takes.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina tightly clutched
the rain frog that looked up at her with an expression of zero affection.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If by any chance she,
the youngest member of the Stingray family, were to be expelled from the
school, she had no idea what her father, who was extremely concerned about
public appearances, would do to her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She recalls her
father's words as he placed his hand on Nina's shoulder when she was still a
child, while he was dragging her around to social gatherings.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Although not as
powerful as her two older brothers, this child also has a highly renowned
psychic ability......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Such a small
child has psychokinesis so powerful that it could cause a mountain to
collapse......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haha, what an
exaggeration. &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt;, you say?......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">"She will
graduate from Heiberg Academy at the top of her class?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">　</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">That's too early to tell......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was able to
ignore the adults' impassive stares, clad in an innocent smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">By that time, Nina had
already noticed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The hand that her
father placed on her shoulder was not filled with love. She realized that her
father was using her as a tool to increase his political power.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She wondered what
would happen to her if she revealed her secret to him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Anyway, that was

suppress her bad habit of going into soliloquy mode whenever she found herself
in the mood.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The same feelings as
usual - fear, frustration, guilt, and other kinds of rough impurities, kept
piling up inside her heart.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, she saw a
piece of concrete the size of her pinky finger lying in front of her. It was
probably debris from the deteriorated fountain.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina extended her palm
to the piece and concentrated all her mind on it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Move,

Nina wished, the piece would not budge. It neither floated nor shattered, but
simply remained in the same state it had been in all along.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, I guess
it's only natural......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina let out a sigh
for what might be the second time today.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She is not a psychic,
so there is no way she could have moved that piece of debris.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina had no idea how
real psychics could make objects levitate or explode.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had never been
able to create a psychic phenomenon, even though she had tried to put her power
into her palms and concentrate her mind with a suitable expression on her face,
just as she had seen the others do.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The reason why such a
person was feared as a powerful psychic and was exempted from the entrance
examination to enter the Heiberg Academy was only because she kept on accumulating
small lies.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... I wonder,
why things ended up like this."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It started out as a
mere coincidence.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is said that the
psychic ability usually manifests itself at the age of four or five, when one
begins to understand things. The underlying mechanism is still unknown, but
that is the way it works anyway.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Children born into the
Stingray family were subjected to a screening process at that time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If a child does not
show any signs of psychic ability, he or she will be expelled from the family
and placed in foster care with a distant relative, even if he or she is the
child of the family's own parents. On the other hand, the Stingray family has
sometimes forcefully adopted a child from a branch family that has developed
psychic abilities.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, the youngest of
three siblings, was no exception to this rule.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">During this time, the
child Nina was under constant surveillance. This was because a child who could
not yet control his or her psychic abilities might have a spontaneous outburst
of these abilities at any moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was about two weeks
after the screening process had begun that something happened.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Accompanied by her
butler, Swanson, Nina was climbing a mountain owned by the Stingray family.
Apparently, her father was intrigued by a dubious thesis that the vastness of
nature could aid in the development of psychic abilities.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That said, the gently
sloping paths were enough for a child's feet to climb, and it was pure joy for
her to be able to breathe fresh air for the first time in a while.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Wow, it's
beautiful."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When they were about
halfway up the mountain, Nina casually pointed to a mountainside in the
distance.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The trees there were
of a completely different color than the surrounding forest, which caught her
interest as a young girl.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, none of the
adults around her recognized it as such.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That was
understandable.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moment Nina
pointed her finger, the slope in that direction suddenly began to collapse.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Eh?
W-What? What's going on?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With a thunderous
roar, trees, boulders, and masses of mud and soil of unusual colors began to
slide down the slope.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, no one
noticed that Nina herself was the most bewildered of everyone. The catastrophic
scene made everyone present foresee the birth of a new talent.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After that,
incomprehensible phenomena kept occurring around Nina.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A cupboard collapsed
even though she did not touch it, a bird flying in the sky suddenly fell, and a
water pipe burst, spraying a large amount of water.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Only Nina knew that
they were entirely coincidental.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The cupboard was just
deteriorating due to aging, the bird just bumped into another bird in mid-air,
and the burst of the water pipe was probably the result of the earthquake that
had occurred the day before.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Still, the adults
never doubted that Nina had a special talent. Her father, who had never been
interested in his daughter from the beginning, was completely satisfied after
receiving the butler's report.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, there were
many times when she wanted to reveal the truth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But Nina knew what
would happen to children who were judged to be fakes, and most of all, she did
not want to disappoint the butler who was looking at her expectantly. So she
kept pretending that she was someone with a psychic ability.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Fortunately, Nina had
a transcendent talent for acting.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She also created a
setting where her abilities were too powerful to control, which also helped,
and until now, no one has ever uncovered her secret.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......If I
confided everything to someone, would it make me feel better?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">How many times have
she thought that?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is a dream that
will never come true. Now that she's at the Heiberg Academy, there's nowhere
she can run away to.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">An information board
was installed at the entrance of the classroom building, where a list of class
assignments was posted. There were almost no students in the vicinity, probably
because she had stayed in front of the fountain until the very last minute
before the end of lunch break.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was only one
student who was staring at the information board with a serious expression on
his face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Pale-orange skin,
unkempt black hair, and slitted eyes the color of the night. His uniform, worn
unceremoniously, was torn in places and stained with mud all over.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The same person seen
at the entrance ceremony who took part in the &lt;Screening test&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".........What?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The boy, who seemed to
have Eastern blood in him, turned a dubious face toward Nina. She seemed to
have been staring at him without realizing it.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Ah,
excuse me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hm? By any
chance, are you......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What he directed at her
was a smile. The corners of the boy's mouth were lifted up, and he even showed
his white teeth in an exemplary smile.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">And yet, there seemed
to be no light shining in his eyes. It was as if there was nothing interesting
in the world.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To mend the awkward
silence, the boy finally opened his mouth.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"...... Yup,
you're Nina Stingray, right? I never imagined that we would be
classmates."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm honored that
you know me. By the way, what is your name?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Uh, ...... do I
have to answer that?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yes?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There would be no way
for anyone to refuse to introduce themselves in such a situation. Nina wondered
whether she hadn't conveyed the question correctly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I see you had a
little trouble hearing me, so let me repeat the question. May I ask your
name?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Stingray-san,
you came here to find information about your class, I presume?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Um, please hear
what people said......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I heard someone
talking about it earlier. You're in [Class 8]."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......T-Thank
you very much."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The conversation was
somewhat confusing, but she decided to express her gratitude anyway.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After seeing the boy
who raised his hand lightly and walked away, she turned her attention to the
information board just to be sure. Finally, she found a number written next to
her own name, which was, as a matter of fact, written as [Class 6].</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">What you're telling me is totally different!</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina looked around in
a panic. The boy who had just lied to her was already heading toward the inner
hallway.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Normally, she would
have just let it slide, but for some reason, she couldn't seem to bear it this
time.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Turns out I'm
not in [Class 8], though?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The boy looked
surprised for a moment, as if he didn't expect her to come after him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, he
immediately returned to a cold expression and muttered in a very low-pitched
tone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Sorry, sorry. I
guess I misunderstood it a little bit."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You said some
random thing to quickly end the conversation, didn't you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She finally noticed
why she couldn't let it slide.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The sense of
discomfort emanating from the boy's attitude probably stemmed from hostility.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's two older
brothers are members of the &lt;White Knights&gt;. They are hailed as heroes,
but it is not surprising that there are those who secretly harbor a grudge
against them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It was really
just a misunderstanding."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even so, the boy did
not seem to be perturbed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You see, I heard
that this academy is a rather harsh place. I thought it would be good to have a
little ordeal on the first day of school to get one's mind right. I'm not
necessarily expecting you to be grateful though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What kind of
reasoning is that?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There is a
saying, [misfortune is God's guidance]. There is always a reason behind
misfortunes. Who knows, maybe your school life from now on will be a pursuit of
the significance of being told the wrong class."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've never heard
such a saying before......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well, of course,
I just made it up after all."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It had been a long
time since she had experienced a situation where she couldn't close her mouth
out of shock.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The stress that had
accumulated since the entrance ceremony could collapse the levee of reason at
any moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal1"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You
really talk a lot, huh...... Despite being unable to read numbers
properly."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There
are all kinds of people in the world after all. Well then, see you some other
time."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The boy left
after he was trying to sway her to the end of the conversation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Gosh, what's wrong
with that guy~!?</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just before
her rationality collapsed, Nina was able to take a deep breath to calm herself
down.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Don't worry, everything will be fine.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unless we are in the same class, I will not have
anything to do with him in the future.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The moment she
stepped into the classroom wearing a graceful and calm expression, Nina sensed
that the atmosphere in the classroom froze for a moment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The students,
who had not yet taken their seats and were still engaged in idle chit-chat in
lieu of self-introductions, turned their eyes to her warily.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was used
to being treated like this.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Even if they
were to treat her like a monster, it would mean that she didn't have to worry about
anyone harming her. And that's good enough for her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina silently
made her way up the stairs and sat down on the rightmost seat on the top row.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was no
particular reason why she had chosen this seat. She simply assumed that there
would be less trouble with no one sitting around her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was
planning to go about her day quietly, but one of the students, paying no
attention to the atmosphere in the classroom, spoke to her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Nina-chan
...... I presume? Is the seat next to you vacant?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The student's
smile radiated an openness reminiscent of the morning sun.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her deep green
eyes sparkled, and her orange short-cut hair gave off an impression of
liveliness to her surroundings.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina was taken
aback, but quickly regained her composure.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of course
it's vacant. Please have a seat."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thank
you!" Before Nina could finish her sentence, she slid into the seat next
to her. "I've always wanted to talk to you, Nina-chan."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The girl, who
identified herself as Emma Licorice, was apparently worried about whether she
would fit in well in class.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">With such a
bright personality, it seemed like she would be able to make friends quickly,
but in reality, Emma seemed to be seriously anxious. Nina thought it was
amusing.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As soon as she
introduced herself, Emma began to bombard Nina with questions one after
another.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">About whether
or not the rumors that Nina, who developed a psychic ability when she was four
years old, caused a mountain near her house to collapse was true or false.
About the type of gemstone that fitted into the brooch she wore on her chest.
About her life in the Stingray family, one of the most prestigious families in
the country.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh,
Nina-chan, are you living in the dormitory, as well? I thought you had a villa
or something like that somewhere nearby."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of
course not. It is the school's rule that all students must live in the
dormitories. I'm strictly abiding by that rule."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Really!?
Then we will have lots of opportunities to play together from now on!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina has a
habit of putting up an invisible wall between her and others before interacting
with them, but she was able to answer Emma's questions in a natural way.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps it was
because she enjoyed seeing Emma's eyes sparkle with anticipation and
excitement, and more than anything, it was because she did not feel anything
like hidden intentions in her behavior.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Maybe I could finally
lead a normal school life.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina secretly
crushed the sweet thought that suddenly came to her mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma is indeed
a good girl, and the days she will spend with her may be filled with joy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, the
place where they met is simply not favorable.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This school is
not a place where youthful activities are encouraged. It is a place solely for
competition for survival, and if one of them drops out, even the memory of
their time together will be erased. In such an environment, there is no way
friendship can be nurtured.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Besides, Nina
thought.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No matter how
kind she may be, if she found out her big secret, she wouldn't treat her the
same way as she does now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Oh, there you are! I've been looking for you, you know!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unaware of
Nina's sentimentality, Emma waved to her friend as he entered the classroom.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The boy tried
to ignore her once, but seemed to have decided to relent when Emma didn't give
up. He let out a deliberate sigh and came lazily up the stairs.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">That guy, no way.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina
questioned Emma with an expression as if she had just heard a bad joke.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Emma?
Are you by any chance friends with him?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Yes, I
am."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Umm,
sorry. I'm a little nervous around people......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's my
first time meeting him, either. Don't worry, Jin-kun is a nice guy."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A nice guy?
Him?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It seems that
we have fundamentally different concepts of good and evil.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The memory of
the trouble that occurred just a few minutes ago in front of the information
board overlapped with the grumpy face in front of her.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Hello",
Nina squeezed out the last ounce of her strength and greeted him in a friendly
manner. "I see we are in the same class, huh?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............ge."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">See? Now you're giving me that annoyed look again!
Also, go ahead and at least introduce yourself!</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She had the
urge to complain, but that would be unbecoming of the daughter of a prestigious
family.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It's okay, he's tired from the exam. Otherwise, he is
just shy.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As she was
making up some reasons to accept him favorably, the boy sat down a little
further away from the two of them.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun,
why don't you join us here?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't
mind me, you two just go ahead and have fun."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Arere~,
are you perhaps shy around such a beautiful girl like Nina-chan?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Of
course not."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The male
student called "Jin" looked at Nina with a gaze that was far from shy
or embarrassed.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I just
don't know what kind of conversation I should have with such a rich young
lady."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As expected,

I'm sure he just hates being around people. Let's leave him alone."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, you
know how us commoners feel, huh? Good for you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">".......Right.
We don't have to go out of our way to entertain him. I'm sure he's more
interested in playing with frogs and snakes in the forest."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hold on
- hold on, why are you two suddenly on edge?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Emma looked
puzzled as she was sandwiched between two people who were saying things to each
other without making eye contact.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina hurriedly
made amends.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm

I have a feeling that I'm being terribly misunderstood......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While the
instructor of the sixth class was explaining the curriculum to the students,
Nina was endlessly cursing him behind her solemn expression.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Even though I am
already exhausted from dealing with this bunch of uncouth elites, just what's
wrong with that guy?</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Is it even appropriate
to behave like that to someone one has just met for the first time? Is it
written in the ethics manuals? Is my common sense wrong?</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Go back and start over
from your previous life! You should fill out a written pledge that you will
never be impertinent with someone you met for the first time and then come back
again, you idiot!</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A~a, gosh, I can't do
this anymore! There's no way I can spend three years in a place like this!</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's true
feelings, which she was desperately trying to hide, were already screaming and
thrashing about.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal5"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Unaware that
his whole body was subjected to a murderous intent, Jin was fighting against
drowsiness as he listened to the instructor in charge's explanation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Just as mentioned
by the male student he interviewed the other day.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The weekly
timetable is mostly made up of general subjects such as Japanese and
mathematics, as well as programs to strengthen physical strength. Although
there are some lectures on psychic abilities, most of them seem to be classroom
lectures.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">This is
evident in the fact that there is little scientific information available
regarding psychic abilities.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the past,
training to enhance latent abilities through medication, hypnotherapy, and
various other spiritual approaches was provided, but this was discontinued
three years ago because it was completely ineffective.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nowadays, the
measurement of growth in one's psychic abilities is limited to monthly ability
tests, bi-weekly &lt;practical tests&gt;, and &lt;duel&gt; between students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The instructor
in charge coldly stated.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Let me
be clear. At Heiberg Academy, competition is everything. We must send the best
and most talented to the White Knights. Students who are content with joining
the police or a security company, or who think they can use their psychic
abilities for industrial purposes, should immediately submit a transfer
application to one of our affiliated schools. Of course, your memories of this
school will be sealed. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Extreme
selectivity, as usual.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Moreover, the
adults at this academy are as overbearing as a judge. Jin wondered whether they
were being instructed on how to speak behind others' backs.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Despite Jin's
attempts to hold back his laughter, the other students' gazes were serious.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The only way
to become a candidate for the White Knights, a special organization that is
also known as the Heroes Who Save the Country, is to graduate from the Heiberg
Academy with the highest grades. For these students, who have been on the elite
path since childhood, transferring to an affiliated school would be
inconceivable.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In this sense,
a system that encourages competition among students perfectly makes sense.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hey,
Jin-kun, hey!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What is
it? The instructor is talking right now."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......You
weren't listening to it seriously at all, though?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After pointing
out this fact, Emma secretly handed him a folded-up piece of paper.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What's
this?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There's
going to be a welcome party for us freshmen!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">When he opened
the paper, he found a brief outline of the welcome party written in beautiful
handwriting.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The party
starts at 7:00 pm. At the second-year students' dormitory for boys. No entry
fee for all freshmen.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I heard
that the sophomore seniors organize it every year."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Welcome
party, huh? ......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It smelled too
fishy.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He was not
really interested in it, but it was not Jin's survival strategy to be so
conspicuous from the very beginning. He should just join in for the time being
and slip out when the opportunity arose.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin handed the
piece of paper to the classmate sitting next to him and stole a glance at the
famous figure beside Emma.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Despite her
honor student mask, Nina Stingray's very nature is that of an out-of-control
monster.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He wondered if
she, by any chance, would attend such a silly party.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Anything you want to tell me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin's inner
rebelliousness began to sprout as she looked at him as if he were a fly
attracted to food scraps.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't
bother me at every turn. Did you fall in love with me at first sight or
something?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There's
a limit to how overconfident you can be."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Shh~, be
quiet. I know this is a little hard for you to understand, but we're in the
middle of a class right now."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wha
......!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Crap, I think I went a
little too far.</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina Stingray is one of only six students in this year's
grade to be exempted from the entrance examinations.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Although it is necessary to get close enough to her so
that his existence is not ignored, it is not a good idea to antagonize her. No,
it is still too early.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin turned
away from the monster who was at a loss for words, while thinking that he would
make a light follow-up later on.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After the
orientation was over, the students moved on to carrying the luggage that had
been delivered to the school to the dormitories. Both the boys' and girls'
dormitories were as grand as mansions, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief
at their elegantly decorated entrances.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It is hard to
imagine how much of the country's budget has been invested in the operation of
the school, since there are three similar dormitories, one for men and one for
women, for each grade. Nevertheless, it was a blessing for Jin that each
student was provided with a room.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While he was
unpacking his belongings in his room, the time for the party to start was
approaching.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8"></span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Within 10
minutes of arriving at the party venue, Jin felt the urge to leave as soon as
possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the first
place, he didn't like the difference in treatment.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In the
dormitory where the party was held, only the six students who were exempted
from the entrance examination and other students with excellent grades were
enjoying the luxurious meals. The rest of the students were not allowed to
enter the dormitory because it was overcrowded, and they were left on the plaza
in front of the dormitory.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Food and
drinks were laid out on a large table set up in the plaza, but it was clearly
not enough to fill the bellies of everyone present. Every once in a while,
someone would steal a fine meat dish from inside the hall, and every time they
did so they were revered as heroes.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The students
in the plaza were, by all accounts, not welcome to enroll.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The fact that
none of the upperclassmen showed their faces to them was proof of this. They
would probably drop out anyway, so there was no point in trying to deepen the
friendship.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps
sensing Jin's sour expression, Emma, who was chatting with the other female
students, suddenly turned to him and spoke.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Jin-kun.
Come on, this is your chance to befriend everyone."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Huh?
When did you become my parent?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh, are
you by any chance socially awkward!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps it was
difficult for Emma and the others, who had been living with the expectations of
those around them as people with psychic abilities since childhood, to
understand the malice that filled this party.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">They could not
take seriously the fact that they were being treated lightly and coldly. Well,
nothing good would come from being sensitive to the ill will of others.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin instantly
concocted a lie to get out of this situation.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......I
actually have a chronic illness."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh? What
kind of illness?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
been at parties for a long time and I get allergic reactions. You probably
wouldn't know the name of the disease even if I told you. In the early stages,
it's just a mild itch or rash, but if it gets worse, it can cause difficulty
breathing, and in the worst case......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Eh~,
there's such an illness?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You must
be doubting me. Weill, that to be expected, no one has ever understood me until
now. Anyway, looks like things will be repeating itself in this
school......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After he
lowered his tone of voice and coughed, Emma began to look dismayed in an
amusing way.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I-I
believe you! Don't push yourself, Jin-kun!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Cough,
thanks. You're the first person to believe me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Alright, I got her.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then,
Emma. I'm going back to the dormitory to take care of myself."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Umm, be
careful, Jin-kun! Call me if you need anything!"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Thank
you. I owe you one."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin tried his
best to hold back his laughter.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It's not a
good habit to have. No matter how gullible Emma is, it is ethically wrong to
play with her to see how much she can be lied to.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That being
said, it was indeed the best solution to leave the party without making a
scene.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin left the
party hall with only a slice of bread and a bottle of water.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">For some
reason, he did not feel like returning to his room, so he kept walking
aimlessly along the dark street.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, he
saw a fountain illuminated by a street lamp.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It seemed that
the water was no longer flowing, so it would be better to describe it as a lump
of concrete in the shape of a fountain.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In front of
the dried-up fountain, there was a wooden bench. Jin felt like taking a short
break, so he headed there while gulping down the rest of his bread with water.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">While gazing
at the silent object, he played with a counterfeit 100-el coin with his fingertips.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was his
usual habit. Whenever he thinks about something, the coin, which has become a
part of his body, helps him calm down.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Come to think
of it, it was thanks to this coin that I was able to sneak into the Heiberg
School.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After passing
the written exam without difficulty, Jin was to demonstrate his psychic
abilities in front of the three instructors at the final interview.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">What he did
was a classic technique often used in psychic frauds.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Having
correctly guessed the name of one of the interviewers' dog, the name of his
favorite bar, and even the present he had prepared for his daughter's birthday,
the interviewers identified Jin as a psychic with psychological abilities. Of
course, the trick was to hire a detective to thoroughly investigate the
personal information of the interviewers.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, he
had an extra trick up his sleeve.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin was able
to guess that one of the interviewers had picked up a 100-el coin just before
coming to the venue.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A simple trick
of dropping the coin on the interviewer's way to work and having a comrade
check to see if he had picked it up. Still, no one doubted him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So far,
everything has gone smoothly, from the entrance exam to the &lt;screening
test&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However, the
plan that he designed before he enrolled in the school has only just begun. His
next target is to contact the six students in his grade who are exempted from
the entrance examination.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Gilrein
Bloodnote. Psychic ability : &lt;The Unheralded One&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina Stingray.
Psychic ability : &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Karen Ashby.
Psychic ability : &lt;Jolly Undertaker&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Alyce Pearson.
Psychic ability : &lt;Bloody Angel&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Bennett Rohr.
Psychic ability : &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Caspar
Crawford. Psychic ability : Unknown.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Except for one
person, the abilities of the students exempted from the entrance examination
are well-known to a certain extent. The fact that they have been able to reign
at the top of the ranks even after many countermeasures have been taken against
them means that they are of a different caliber than the average student. Of
course, there would be no one among them that Jin could beat in a head-to-head
battle.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In any case,
it is almost certain that the &lt;Shepherd Dog&gt; is among these six.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He is the one
who holds the key to reaching the final goal. Whether it is to intimidate or
blackmail them, or to dig into their pockets to extract information, Jin must
first uncover the identity of the &lt;Shepherd Dog&gt; that blends in amongst
the students.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">So far,
however, he has not been able to get any decent clues. That means he will have
to face them all until he hits the jackpot.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But then
again, Jin thought.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It's crazy for
a mere con artist to have to deal with such monsters. One might even call it
insane. The more difficult the game, the more exciting it is, but this is way
too much.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Are the
occasional shivers caused by excitement and pleasure, or by fear?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin grinned
devilishly as he watched the coins flicked by his thumbs and fluttering through
the air.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Well then, how shall we proceed?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He hasn't
decided who to start with.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The most
likely candidates would be Karen Ashby or Bennett Rohr. However, he still
cannot predict the movements of the other students, and there is still room to
find out more about their psychic abilities.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">At least one
month.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As long as
there are a lot of cards on the table, one should not move too much and
concentrate on gathering information. Then it will be time to fine-tune the
plan.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">After thinking
for a while, Jin noticed a figure coming toward him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her
beautifully braided platinum-colored hair and a classy brooch adorned with a
subtle red gemstone made everyone know at a glance that she was of good family
origin.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina Stingray.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She is one
among the group exempted from the entrance exam, whom he will have to face
sooner or later.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She is also
the student most likely to be a &lt;shepherd dog&gt; at this point.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was not a
good idea to run into her this early, but Jin had already missed his chance to
leave this place.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He decided to
hide behind the fountain for the time being, and there was no sign that the
other party had noticed him. Nina sat down on the bench where Jin had been
sitting earlier.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A ray of light
from her moonlit eyes caught Jin's attention.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="JA" class="calibre8">─</span></i><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">Is she crying, by any
chance? Why?</span></i></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She hugged her
knees while staring dazedly at the fountain.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her eyes,
which had shone so sarcastically when she was in the front row of the
auditorium and in the classroom, were now completely dull.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina pulled
out a glittering object out of somewhere.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was an
expressionless frog doll, forcibly dressed in a gaudy suit decorated with
sequins. Jin could not read much of the design intentions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina, as
expected, started talking to the doll.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~, I'm
exhausted ....... I wonder why those bunch of elites love to party so much.
Isn't it just a farce of social pleasantries with no substance? I was smiling
so much I thought my facial muscles would cramp up."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Huh? Is she talking to someone?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin sneakily
looked around, but as expected, Nina was the only one sitting on the bench.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"A~,
gosh, I'm getting so fed up with all this nonsense. I'd rather be in my room
reading a book than attending such a pointless gathering."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Perhaps
feeling bad eavesdropping on this, he involuntarily backed away, which was so
unusual of him to do so.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina reacted
to the slightest noise and turned her head toward him.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hyah~!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina's eyes
widened and she let out a small squeal. Her slender body was so bent over that
she almost fell off the bench.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Feeling the
need to explain himself, Jin emerged from the shadows of the fountain with the
most cautious movements possible.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
Well, umm, I didn't mean to startle you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"How, how
long have you been there!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
been here since a while ago. You showed up out of the blue, so I hid myself on
the spur of the moment."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"............Did
you see?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">A dangerous
girl appeared with tears in her eyes, talking to herself to an emotionless frog
doll. No matter how one looks at it, this is an unbecoming appearance for a
person with psychic abilities who is feared throughout the empire.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">It was an
incomprehensible situation, but at the very least, it was certain that there
was no way that a half-baked lie would work.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I saw it
...... but, don't worry. I won't tell anyone."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Do you
expect me to trust you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">That being said, did Nina ever talk like this in the
classroom?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her current tone of voice is more befitting of a young
lady from a prominent family.......</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">However,
that's not what one should be thinking about right now.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">No matter how
weird things might be, it was a fact that Nina was among those who were
exempted from the entrance exam. Clashing with her right now was not part of
Jin's plan.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What can
I say, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to someone about it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......
it's none of your business."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Well,
that's for sure."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Should I just leave her be and go back to the
dormitory?</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Suddenly, such
a thought came to his mind.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">To begin with,
he had not liked this girl from the first time he met her in front of the
classroom building.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">She was born
with everything she should have, and she has a promising future ahead of her,
but she walked with a downcast expression on her face, as if she was in a great
deal of distress.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Her appearance
seemed as if she was mocking the life that Jin had led up to this point in his
life.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin was about
to leave peacefully, but Nina's mutterings stopped him in his tracks.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Haa,
why this guy of all people."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......It's
nothing."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"If you
have something to say, say it clearly."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I should make up a good reason and quickly walk away
from this place.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><i class="calibre25"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">I understand why my heart is frayed. But now I must
remain calm.</span></span></i></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"An
ordinary person like you has nothing to do with this. What are you trying to do
by getting involved with my affairs? If you are trying to win money from me,
you are wasting your time and effort. So it would be wise for you to
stop."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Before Jin
knew it, Nina had returned to her usual overly polite tone.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">As it was, she
went on with a mechanical smile plastered on her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Enough
about this, may I ask for this poor man to quickly disappear? Come on,
shoo-shoo~."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">If it were the
usual Jin, he would have been able to brush it off nicely.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">He would
simply shrug his shoulders lightly, then turn on his heel and walk back to the
dormitory. It's a simple move that even a three-year-old could do.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">But Nina's
words touched a sensitive part of his inner being.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">The dusty
street, the stares of unknown adults, the freezing night to the core - memories
that should have been erased from his brain began to come back to him vividly.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Once this happens,
he can't hold back any longer.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm just
worried about you. You know, people often say that the Stingray family is full
of monsters who don't have a human heart. I can imagine how hard it must be for
you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What do
you know about us Stingrays?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
heard a lot of bad rumors about your brothers in the &lt;White Knights&gt;. Oh,
by the way, is it true that your family uses the skulls of the people you kill
as plates?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Instead
of prying into my family environment, wouldn't it be better for you to think about
your own life? Surely, you support your family with the monthly allowance that
is provided to students here, right?</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
exactly the kind of needless prying you are just talking about. Did I ever tell
you such a private matter?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I can
tell without asking. Just look at those cheap shoes you're wearing. It seems
that you are forced to live a very poor life even though you have psychic
abilities. Poor you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I'm not
interested in fashion. Do you have a problem with it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Hee.
That kind of excuse is popular among the commoners, huh? I'm learning a
lot."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"As I
expected, the Stingray family's young lady is mentally strong. Normally, it
would be too embarrassing to buy branded goods with the money earned from
conflicts and assassinations."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">There was no
consideration for the other party, no roundabout metaphorical expressions.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Both sides'
sharp words were relentlessly thrust at the places the other wanted to be
touched the least.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Ah,
geez! What does this have to do with my family?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Same
goes for you. You have no right to tell me anything about my family."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
because you lashed out at me ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You were
the one who started it though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haa? It
all started because you were stalking me, remember?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haa?
Don't you dare insult my taste about women."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Cut the
crap, and just admit it. I won't report you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"How
overconfident can you be? As I explained to you earlier. It just happened to be
here......."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Then,
explain to me what business you had in such a remote place."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"My
father designed this fountain here. So I thought I'd come and check it
out."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Do you
really think such a made-up story is going to work?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Tsk,
you're the one who followed me here in the first place, aren't you? You didn't
want to admit that you are the stalker, so you panicked and framed me."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't
suddenly distort the truth on me. There's no way I would do something like
that."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Look,
your breathing is getting faster. It's a sign that you're agitated. And you've
been glancing your eyes down a lot, which is a classic sign of someone who's
hiding something."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Haaa~~!?
That's nothing more than an accusation."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There
you go, [That's nothing more than an accusation]. This line is frequently used
when someone with a guilty conscience is pressed for the facts. There's a
recent research report by a professor at Livingstone University, would you like
to hear more about it?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I've
never heard of such a university though."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"It's
natural since it's a foreign university. It's a pretty well-known thesis in the
psychology community, so anyone with an ear for research usually knows about
it."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......Even
if such a thesis really exists, I'm still not a stalker."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Oh,
really? So the young lady of the Stingray family is denying a noble field of
science?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Wait a
minute! Why has the subject suddenly changed!?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Come on,
just apologize. You won't have to pay me any compensation if you apologize
now."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Gosh,
you're the one who should apologize! Do you think you'll be okay if I raise my
voice here?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"......This
bastard is finally resorting to her last resort."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Come on,
hurry up. And make sure to take out all the photos you took."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Damn it,
don't fuck with me, you heretic."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Don't
use such foul language on me. Besides, you're a psychic, as well, aren't
you?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You're
noisy ...... Besides, I'm not interested in you at all. I don't even want
anything to do with you ever again."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"What an
unusual thing for me to agree with you. I found you an eyesore, as well."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"That's
good to hear. If you see me in class, could you please not talk to me?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"No-no,
that would be too lenient for you."</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina went on with
the coldest smile on her face.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"There
are ways to expel either one of us from the school, you know?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre3"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre8">A &lt;duel&gt;

were tantamount to a declaration of war.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Of course, no
matter how he looked at it, Jin had no chance of winning. Nina, who was exempted
from the entrance exam, had 1000 points, whereas Jin had only 95 points,
including the points he earned from Tedd in the &lt;Screening Test&gt;.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">In this case,
it would be impossible to make even a proper wager.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"You got
a really short fuse, huh? This is why your Stingray family is poorly regarded,
you guys are so eager to get into a fight like this. ......"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"Are you
scared?"</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Nina smiled
the kind of smile she would give to an impertinent child and continued.</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">"I don't
mind if calling it off, you know? Even if my opponent is a creepy stalker, it

down now, Jin's reputation would plummet to the ground. </span></span></p><p class="msonormal6"><span lang="EN-US" class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">Jin no longer
