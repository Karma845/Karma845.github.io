<h3>Chapter 15</h3>

<p>Before heading to the outer wall, I decided to take a look at the fourth castle wall that was under construction.<br />
The height of the wall under construction was about 12 meters. I couldn&#8217;t imagine how long the total length of extension required to surround the royal capital Alphen is.<br />
Since this was done almost entirely by hand, I wondered how much money and labor had been put into it&#8230; As I was looking around, I noticed that there were people at the construction site who clearly didn&#8217;t look like manual workers.<br />
It&#8217;s not just one or two people. If you look closely, you can find them here and there.<br />
Seeing them holding something that looks like a catalyst, they must be mages. It seemed that they’re applying earth magic to help with the construction.</p>
<p>[Hoo&#8230;]</p>
<p>I tried observing the scene using magic eyes.<br />
It seems that the magic mud wall was used to fill in the gaps between the piled up stones and help fix them in place.<br />
The magic of the mud wall helped create a solid wall that looks like it&#8217;s hardened with cement, not just dirt. It doesn&#8217;t even break if someone just slashed it with a sword a little bit, huh.<br />
But I see, this was a technique that seemed to be quite useful. Let’s take note of this.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s big, isn&#8217;t it?]</p>
<p>[I wonder what this castle wall is supposed to protect the city from.]</p>
<p>Was there a war between humans, or was it against monsters?<br />
From what I&#8217;ve experienced so far in Eriard, the Karendil Kingdom seemed to have nothing to do with wars between humans, and I had an image that monsters were only found in forests and other places where human development has not reached.</p>
<p>[I think it&#8217;s probably for the next great flood! Will it be in time?]</p>
<p>[Great flooding?]</p>
<p>A great flood was said to be a phenomenon in which monsters overflowed from all areas where monsters live.<br />
It seemed to occur at intervals of ten to twenty years.</p>
<p>[It happened when I was a little kid. I didn&#8217;t really understand it at the time, but the maids were crying. I remember the number of soldiers guarding the Royal Palace had decreased. I thought they returned to their family or gone to the battlefield somewhere and never came back. It wasn&#8217;t until much later that I realized that.]</p>
<p>[Don’t tell me&#8230; When was the last time it happened?]</p>
<p>[Twelve years ago. It wouldn&#8217;t be strange if a great flood occurred at any time soon.]</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>However, it seems that God granted an oracle when a great flood occurred.<br />
While there seemed to be a lot of variation in how long after the oracle was granted the flood occurred, judging from past precedents, it seemed that there was at least one month&#8217;s grace period.</p>
<p>[Even though it&#8217;s called a great flood, the scale varies from place to place. Some get so few that it&#8217;s shocking, others are terrifyingly numerous. It seemed that in the previous great flood, a large amount of monsters rushed into this Royal Capital, Alphen, and caused a lot of damage.]</p>
<p>Was that the reason for the construction of the fourth wall?<br />
If there was an event like that, I had to be as strong as possible before that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>At the outer wall, it was just chaos.<br />
It looks like the shops we stopped at have become even more miscellaneous.<br />
If you went a little further into the back streets, you&#8217;d find people who seemed to be vagrants sitting helplessly, and people who seemed to be priests preaching at the crossroads.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re bards or adventurers, but there were some who sang while playing instruments. They looked more like adventurers after a second look.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s delicious, what kind of meat is it?]</p>
<p>[Hmm&#8230; is it a bird?]</p>
<p>The two of us twisted our heads while eating skewers of meat sold at the street stall.<br />
The texture was similar to filet. If it&#8217;s not a bird, then maybe it&#8217;s from a reptile or a frog. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve eaten it, but I&#8217;d seen it before on the internet.<br />
When I asked about it, it turned out to be the meat of a huge lizard called a forest lizard. Maybe it&#8217;s seasoned, but it&#8217;s salty and delicious.<br />
Marl didn&#8217;t seem particularly concerned when she heard that it was lizard meat. Well, monster meat was quite commonly used as food ingredients in this world.<br />
Even so, it&#8217;s the real pleasure of traveling to taste ingredients you&#8217;ve never eaten in a foreign land. Let&#8217;s eat various things without fear.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Here&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p>[Let&#8217;s go Taichi-san, we have no business here!]</p>
<p>While we were wandering around, we eventually stumbled into the brothel district. But, Marl pulled me hard and we passed by at a tremendous speed.<br />
Hahaha, I&#8217;m devoted to you, Marl, so don&#8217;t worry so much.</p>
<p>But, I&#8217;m sorry to say this&#8230;I was just really curious.<br />
It can&#8217;t be helped, I’m a healthy man after all.</p>
<p>Marl&#8217;s modest yet beautiful breasts are nice, but once in a while, I&#8217;d like to experience a pair of big plump breasts.<br />
When I was thinking about such things, Marl pinched me on the side. My bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[Our slaves are healthy and strong! If you&#8217;re looking for a skilled combat slave, check it out!]</p>
<p>[How&#8217;s it going? The girls we&#8217;re selling a looker, right? They&#8217;re all virgins!]</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>[The slaves handled by our firm are trained in reading, writing, calculation, and the rules of service. Yes, of course, we also have elves. Come on, over here&#8230;]</p>
<p>We arrived at the slave market, the most chaotic place outside the walls.<br />
Various slaves were bought and sold here, and various stalls were lined up around the slave market for customers who came to buy slaves.<br />
Someone sold clothing and sandals for newly bought slaves, and others sold food and drink. Among them, there was also a business of casting a purification spell that even accepted commission work.<br />
Perhaps because it&#8217;s a place that at worst can smell like pigsty, the magic of purification seemed to come in handy.</p>
<p>There were various types of slaves for sale, such as combat slaves to be taken along on adventures, service slaves to take care of personal needs, and labor slaves to engage in agricultural work.<br />
In the world where I used to live, slavery was widely used in the past. However, at least in my time, it was judged to be a barbaric, evil deed that ignores human rights.<br />
I was shocked by the fact that people like me were actually being bought and sold like commodities right in front of me.</p>
<p>I knew it in terms of knowledge.<br />
For example, in fantasy-themed works, the existence of slaves and the slave market that deals with them often appears, and even after coming to Eriard, I heard about the existence of slaves several times.<br />
In the town of Crossroads, I even saw people who I’d never thought were slaves.<br />
However, it was too shocking to see slaves actually being bought and sold.</p>
<p>[Taichi-san, are you okay?]</p>
<p>Marl looked at me worriedly.</p>
<p>[Yeah, I’m okay. I was just a little shocked. In the world I lived in, selling and buying slaves was forbidden, and it was judged to be a hateful evil.]</p>
<p>They were adventurers who were bankrupt due to debt, daughters of merchants who were put up for sale to pay up a large amount of debt due to failure in business, and children who were sold from farming villages to save money.<br />
There were also criminal slaves who committed crimes and fell into slavery.<br />
This kind was bound by slavery control magic and bought and sold as commodities.</p>
<p>[If you feel sick, let us go home. It is not good to overdo it.]</p>
<p>[No, it&#8217;s okay. If this is a matter of course in this world, we can&#8217;t avoid it.]</p>
<p>Yes, I decided to live in this world, so I have to accept no matter how shocking it may be.<br />
In the world you used to live in, even if something like that came out in a game, it would have been accepted as such. That&#8217;s how it was.<br />
I took Marl to see the slave market.<br />
Each of the slaves behaved differently.<br />
There were those who looked healthy, those who were frightened, those who had no energy as if they had given up on everything, and those who were sick and about to die.<br />
It didn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a man or a woman. However, there were still many young people.<br />
Although combat slaves and slaves who can read, write, and calculate were not limited to this, they were generally young.<br />
In terms of price, the lower the age, the cheaper they were, and conversely, the older the child, the cheaper they seemed.<br />
A 15-year-old service slave with no particular skills sold for 20 gold coins. A strong battle slave who was likely to become an immediate fighting force cost 50 gold coins.<br />
Physically handicapped or ill slaves were at a price that can only be said to be discarded. I guess the slave traders also think that if they sold it, it would be as good as they’d get.<br />
And criminal slaves were cheap. No matter how much you bound them with slavery control magic, there were very few people who would buy a criminal after all.</p>
<p>[Taichi-san, I&#8217;m watching you intently, but are you going to buy a slave?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;No, it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen it, so I&#8217;m just curious. I have no intention of buying――]</p>
<p>My eyes were glued to one criminal slave.<br />
Her jet-black hair, which was like darkness, was covered in dust and became frizzy, and her eyes, which had glistened like obsidian knives, were murky with despair. Her beauty was dulled with despair and fatigue.<br />
Holding her knees like a child, nothing reflected in her empty eyes, she was just there.<br />
Marl noticed this and followed my gaze, recognizing the slave I was staring at.</p>
<p>[That person&#8230;]</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>The disfigured former assassin Fram Forses was there.</p>
<p>[Are you interested in that woman? You have a good eye, master! She&#8217;s a slave that I just purchased recently! She looks a little unsightly now, but she&#8217;s quite a good catch. She&#8217;s a little unresponsive, but she also has combat skills.]</p>
<p>[How much?]</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but I immediately called out to the slave trader who was selling Fram.<br />
Marl snuggled up to me without saying anything and just watched over me.</p>
<p>[It&#8217;s 30 gold coins, isn&#8217;t it a bargain?]</p>
<p>She&#8217;s certainly exceptional as a battle slave. But, it&#8217;s too expensive for a criminal slave.</p>
<p>[Don&#8217;t try to cheat me, that woman is probably a criminal slave. As far as I can see, she has no will to live, and I doubt if she can fight. 10 gold coins.]</p>
<p>[Oi oi sir, it&#8217;s just out of the question. She&#8217;s an excellent slave, not only as a battle slave, but as a sex slave. How about 25 gold coins?]</p>
<p>[With that condition, no matter how much I fuck her, she won’t even let out a moan. Even if she looks good, she’s pretty much a doll. 15 gold coins.]</p>
<p>[Okay! Okay! 20 gold coins! I can&#8217;t lower the price any more!]</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen around the slave market, I think it&#8217;s still expensive.<br />
But that&#8217;s fine. It’s that girl&#8230;what? Why am I buying her?<br />
Am I feeling guilty? No, let&#8217;s not think too much about it. I want to buy, so I buy, that&#8217;s all.<br />
I gave the slave trader 20 gold coins outright.</p>
<p>[Okay, okay, then drip a drop of your blood here on this contract.]</p>
<p>I confirm the contents of the contract that the slave trader took out. It&#8217;s like a contract for slave ownership.<br />
In a nutshell, it seemed that by becoming Fram&#8217;s owner, I had to provide her with food, clothing and shelter.<br />
Slaves absolutely obey their master&#8217;s orders. The effect of slave magic prohibited any action that harmed the master , and if the prohibition was broken, in the worst case scenario the effect of slave magic may lead to the slave’s death.<br />
As a criminal slave, Fram was obligated to comply with my request for sexual intercourse. If this was also refused, it is considered to have violated the contract.<br />
There were other details written, but those were the general contents.</p>
<p>[Is this your first time buying a slave, boss?]</p>
<p>[Yeah.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[I thought so, because people who are used to buying don&#8217;t check the contract so hard. But, it&#8217;s a good thing. There are also vicious slave traders sometimes.]</p>
<p>[I’ll be careful.]</p>
<p>I cut my fingertip with a hunter knife and spilled blood on the contract.<br />
Blood seeped into the contract, giving it a faint glow. The deal seemed to have concluded.</p>
<p>[When you no longer need slaves, take them to this slave market or the government office. We&#8217;ll buy them for you.]</p>
<p>[Oh, I see.]</p>
<p>The slave trader walked over to Fram, took off the chain attached to her collar and brought her here.<br />
Fram stood up as prompted and walked staggeringly towards me with her head down while being led by the slave trader.</p>
<p>[This boss is your master now. Do your best.]</p>
<p>The slave trader said so as he pushed Fram toward me.<br />
For the first time Flamm raised his head and saw my face.<br />
Her eyes, which were clouded with despair, opened wide and dyed with fear.</p>
<p>[Heh, he&#8230;no, no&#8230;]</p>
<p>Fram recoiled back and tried to retreat. It seemed that she was barely cleaned up considering her still rough appearance.<br />
I approached Fram, forced her to stand, and cast purification magic on her.<br />
Her dull black hair had become unbelievably beautiful, and I could now see her face without the dust.</p>
<p>[Follow me.]</p>
<p>[No, no&#8230; Ugh!?]</p>
<p>The slave magic seemingly caused Fram to suffer when she refused my order.<br />
I pulled Fram closer and muttered something to convince her.</p>
<p>[I won&#8217;t do anything bad, so just follow me. You hear?]</p>
<p>Fram nodded with a pale face at my words. Her face with tears in her eyes looked somewhat childish.</p>
<p>[Taichi-san, let&#8217;s go to the shop over there and buy a coat and footwear.]</p>
<p>[Yeah, let’s wrap it up for today and return to the mansion.]</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>We bought a hooded cloak and simple sandals for Fram and left the slave market.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>[Taichi-san, why her&#8230;?]</p>
<p>Marl asked me around the time we entered the new city from the outer wall.<br />
Why? Even if you ask me, I couldn&#8217;t give you a clear answer.</p>
<p>[My sense of guilt got the best of me. Even though I was a little, well, quite crazy at that time, I did something terrible. After that, I neglected it without paying particular attention to it, and actually forgot about it until I saw her today. No, I was trying not to think about it.]</p>
<p>Saying that, I let out a sigh and glanced behind me.<br />
Fram&#8217;s gait was a little unsteady, but she was firmly following behind us.</p>
<p>[It might be just my attempt to atone for my sins, but I&#8217;m also a hypocrite. There are other things that I considered when I decided to buy her. I can use her as a fighting force, and I remember the crazy pleasure I had at that time.]</p>
<p>Thinking back on what I did after defeating the assassins makes my head hurt.<br />
I tried not to think about it as much as possible, so I put a lid on my memory. I wanted to forget about that moment of madness.<br />
So, here I tried to balance it out by buying Fram and protecting her as best as I can. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I&#8217;m likely to vomit.<br />
But on top of that, there was also the aspect of re-experiencing that one-sided pleasure-seeking reckless act, so I can&#8217;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m getting a little jealous.]</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe my ears at Marl&#8217;s sudden words. I didn’t get what she meant.</p>
<p>[Taichi-san, you&#8217;re only thinking about that woman right now, aren&#8217;t you? She&#8217;s the first woman to receive Taishi-san&#8217;s dark desires, is she not?]</p>
<p>[Well, yeah&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Taichi-san loves me and treats me kindly, but he&#8217;s never consciously directed that kind of beastly desire to me. That part of Taichi-san is monopolized by that person. When I think about it, it&#8217;s kind of frustrating. At the first time, you just lost your wits because of alcohol.]</p>
<p>I feel like I can&#8217;t understand what Marle is saying, but what about that?<br />
I looked behind me again, but Fram&#8217;s expression was hidden under her hood and I couldn&#8217;t see it.<br />
Fram could have heard my conversation with Marl, but there is no way I know what she thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p>[Welcome home! Master! Um, what about those people? ]</p>
<p>When I returned to the mansion, Maybel, who had just been cleaning the hall, greeted me with a bright smile.<br />
I&#8217;m at a loss as to how to answer Maybel&#8217;s question. I haven&#8217;t completely sorted it out yet.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>[I&#8217;m sorry, but please treat her as a guest for now. I&#8217;ll go to take a bath now, so please prepare a meal.]</p>
<p>[Yes!]</p>
<p>With a pitter-patter sound, Maybel replied. That small animal-like feeling somehow healed my broken heart.<br />
I urged Fram and guided her to the bath. Marl also came with us.<br />
But, I was in trouble when we got to the dressing room. I feel like it&#8217;s not a good idea to keep an eye on her, but I&#8217;m also worried about leaving her alone.<br />
As I was wondering what to do, Fram began to undress of her own accord.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not as beautiful as Marl.<br />
There were scars all over her body, and what appeared to be burns scars that may have been inflicted by magic.<br />
However, her supple body, well-defined proportions, and abundant breasts gave her a charm that more than made up for it.</p>
<p>Naked Fram slowly approached me with a blank expression and began to take off my clothes.<br />
When I stopped her hand, she showed a strange expression.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;m fine. Soak yourself in and get rid of your fatigue. Don&#8217;t even think about trying to take your own life.]</p>
<p>Fram nodded at my words and entered the bath with unsteady steps.<br />
Seeing that, Marl pushed me out of the dressing room.</p>
<p>[I&#8217;ll come in with you. Taichi-san, please come back later.]</p>
<p>Saying that, Marl slammed the dressing room door shut.<br />
It was a little worrying, but with the slave magic in place, nothing shouldn&#8217;t happen.<br />
I threw myself on the sofa in the living room and just waited for the time to pass.</p>
<p>After about an hour, Marl and Fram came out of the bath.<br />
Marl made Fram sit on a chair and carefully wiped her black hair.<br />
Fram was taller than Marl, but when I saw her wiping the hair of the former as she pleased, for some reason Marl looked like the older of the two, which was strange.<br />
I just stared blankly at those two without doing anything.<br />
I haven&#8217;t been able to clear my head for some time. I felt like drinking alcohol, even though the sun hadn&#8217;t set yet.</p>
<p>[Taichi-san?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Huh? Oh, what happened?]</p>
<p>It seems that she finished wiping Fram&#8217;s hair before I knew it. Marl was looking at me with a worried expression.</p>
<p>[I will leave the room for a bit, so please try to talk to Fram-san. I shall be nearby, so please call me if you need anything.]</p>
<p>When Marl said so, she made Fram sit next to me and took Maybel out of the living room and into the dining room.<br />
Even if you tell me to speak, what should I say?<br />
Should I apologize? I feel something different.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>[You have nothing to worry about.]</p>
<p>It was Fram who broke the silence.</p>
<p>[I, we aimed at your life and lost. Even if everyone was killed, there is nothing to complain about&#8230;!]</p>
<p>Having said that, she couldn&#8217;t help but start crying while looking down.<br />
I can&#8217;t even hold her shoulder. I didn&#8217;t think I had that right. As long as the other side is my slave, whatever I do is probably up to me, but I couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>[Speaking of which, if you killed me at that time too&#8230;why, only me&#8230;! U, uu&#8230;.., Waaaaaaaa.]</p>
<p>Fram wept.<br />
Her friends were killed right in front of her, and she was the only one who survived.<br />
To be abandoned by a country to which she gave her everything, even to the point of doing their dirty work.<br />
Criticized as useless by her father, who was her only family member and master, and was abandoned.</p>
<p>[Why! Why didn’t you kill me at that time! ! ? If you kill me at that time, if only you kill me! I wish I hadn&#8217;t felt this way! Guh, ahhhhh!]</p>
<p>Flam hit my chest despite being tormented by slavery magic.<br />
Again and again. Until her body fell on my chest like a thread had been cut.<br />
Judging from her heavy breathing, she was neither dead nor fainted. Perhaps she simply couldn&#8217;t stand the pain of the slave magic.<br />
I tried to say something, but nothing came out. The words were there, but it’s like they all stuck in my throat.<br />
I was able to imagine what kind of experience Fram had from every word she said.</p>
<p>Think about what went wrong.</p>
<p>The military feared my power and sent an assassin squad to try to kill me.<br />
I didn&#8217;t want to die, so I turned the assassin unit on and killed everyone but Fram.<br />
I raped Fram as demanded by my fear, desire, beastliness, excitement, and madness.</p>
<p>Then, I threw her away.</p>
<p>Yes, I threw her away. Without taking responsibility. I just ate and dashed.<br />
I threw away the evidence of my madness, and covered it so that it could not be seen.<br />
Like putting a lid on something that stinks.<br />
In the end, I guess I just took the winner&#8217;s right and didn&#8217;t fulfill my duty as one.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t kill them all. I treated her a little roughly, but at least I kept one person alive, didn&#8217;t I?<br />
I wanted to escape reality.<br />
Oh my God, I was the worst. I felt like laughing at myself despite the nausea.</p>
<p>At that time, I should have killed Fram.</p>
<p>[It was my fault. I took my rights as the winner and did not fulfill my obligations. I am cowardly trash. You can hate me.]</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>I said so and stroked Fram&#8217;s head. I continued stroking.<br />
For a while Fram sobbed with hot tears spilling onto my chest, but after a while she calmed down.<br />
She was sleeping with a peaceful face.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">=====</p>
<p><strong>~Great Flood~ </strong></p>
<p>A mass outbreak of monsters that occurred in an unstable cycle of 10 to 20 years.<br />
How many monsters, from where they came from, and where they rushed to. All of it remained unknown.<br />
A mysterious phenomenon that had been recorded and researched each time it occurred, but no pattern had yet been discovered.<br />
The cause of the outbreak had not been identified, and what was known was that an oracle that prophesied the outbreak would come before it happens.<br />
There were also unbelievers who claimed that the flood was brought about by God.<br />
There were also believers who could only be thought of as masochists who claimed that it was a trial brought on by God.</p>
<p>In the end, only God knew the truth.</p>
