<h2>Interlude 1: Online Gaming Couples Chat Log</h2>


<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Ah, you’re here! I was wondering if you’d show up today.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Sorry, sorry. I got caught up studying, ended up running late.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Ah, gotcha. Finals are approaching, right?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Yeah, and this time, I really can’t afford to slack off. If my grades drop any further, my allowance takes a serious hit.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Wait, weren’t you ranked second in the class last time?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>I mean Kotomi!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Kotomi’s allowance is on the line!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Ah, I see. Were you teaching Kotomi-san?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Yes!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>You’re such a good big brother.</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>By the way, is it okay to talk about school stuff?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> What do you mean?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>During our first offline meetup, you mentioned not wanting to talk about school to maintain the gaming atmosphere and not spoil it. Remember?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Ah, yeah, I remember! I said that, but can we lift the ban? Only if you’re okay with it, Mahorin!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I don’t mind. In fact, it’s just right.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Did you want to talk about school too? Maybe get some tutoring from me?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>No, I’ll manage on my own.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> So, what did you want to talk about?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Today, Naru-chan and I went out to play and stopped by the convenience store on the way back. And Naru-chan got this clear file from <em>“Passionate Warrior Princess.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Takase!? </p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Is she an otaku!?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>I wonder. Maybe she just had a “take whatever you can get” attitude.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>I see. But it’d be cool if she’s an otaku!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Right? It’d be fun if she is. Even though we can’t talk about anime at school, it would make it easier for Kotomi-san and Naru-chan to chat!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Are you worried about Kotomi?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin:</strong> Of course. We’re friends, after all.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha: </strong>Thanks! She’d be thrilled if she hears that!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>You’re welcome. That’s why I want to investigate whether Naru-chan is an otaku, and I’d like your help.</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Help? How?</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>It’d be quicker to explain over the phone. Can I call you?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Wait, wait!</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> I gotta go to the toilet!</p>



<p><strong>Mahorin: </strong>Alright, I’ll call in about ten minutes, okay?</p>



<p><strong>Jet Black Yasha:</strong> Got it!</p>
