<h2>Epilogue: In The Dazzling Morning Light</h2>


<p class="calibre4">The next morning, I woke up to the sound of a different smartphone than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I fumble for the smartphone ringing by my pillow and tap the screen without even looking, still groggy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of the smartphone stops.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yawn, it’s about time to get up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stretch out in bed, but before I can fully extend my arms and legs, I bump into something next to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ouch…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My hand makes contact, and a voice other than mine speaks up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turn my head and look to the side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the same bed, there’s another person. They turn over, and their face turns towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nishiki Yuunagi’s sleeping face is right in front of me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;!? No way, why?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I raise my voice and sit up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking around the room, I realize that this is his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The indirect lighting by the pillow has been on since last night, and we are lying side by side on a single bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m also still in the same clothes as yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I immediately grasped the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Last night, I intended to return to my room after making sure he was asleep next to the bed. But I fell asleep instead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, when I woke up in the middle of the night, I sleepily crawled back into bed as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And now, I’ve woken up again in his room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ve really done it now!!!! Part 2.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Who would have thought I’d repeat the same mistake!?</p>
<p class="calibre4">To make matters worse, I ended up spending the night in the same bed with him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I slept with a man…</p>

<p class="calibre4">Flashes of yesterday’s events flood my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His vulnerable expression made my heart flutter, my careless actions in the bathroom and the words we exchanged&mdash;resulted in an overnight stay in his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m so mortified, I almost scream out loud, but then…</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Nishiki? Is there someone else there?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">The alarm had stopped, but a woman’s voice could be heard through the speaker.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quickly grabbed the smartphone and saw that it was in a call state with Akira Kuhouin’s name on the screen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems I accidentally operated his phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Who’s there with you?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin-san’s voice sounded suspicious and doubtful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If my identity is revealed here, it’s social death. Oh no, what should I do!?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Meanwhile, Nishiki-kun wakes up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Sensei, what’s&mdash;mmpf!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quickly covered his mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hellooo, I’m Yuunagi’s mother. I’m here to take care of his cold.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I desperately change my voice and explain my situation without being asked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Nishiki’s mother? I’m sorry. I’m his classmate, Kuhouin. Your voice sounds quite young. I was surprised.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I get that a lot.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sweating coldly, I continue to pretend to be his mother.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Excuse me, but have we met before? Your voice sounds familiar…』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe you’re mistaken. So, what can I do for you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nishiki-kun removes my hand and realizes who I’m talking to.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『I called because I was worried about his health.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s already feeling better, his fever’s down, and he’s got an appetite. Don’t worry, and thank you for calling him.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Beside me, Nishiki-kun tries to suppress his laughter, looking much better compared to yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Then that’s good, please give him my regards.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">After the call with Kuhouin-san ended, I feel a wave of relief wash over me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t make me laugh right after waking up! You scared me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nishiki-kun had recovered enough to laugh as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I thought my heart was going to stop.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My heart is still racing, and I lean on the bed for support.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you unconsciously crawled into bed again. What are you doing right after saying something like that last night? Really, it would’ve been bad if you caught my cold.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He was worried and seemed to understand why I was in bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, I have no excuse.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was too embarrassed to face him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was sleeping so soundly that I didn’t notice at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s good. Looks like your fever is completely gone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to you for staying by my side.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not true.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s true that Tenjō-san’s care helped me recover.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He’s in a great mood, having recovered from his cold.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Still, I missed a great opportunity.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What opportunity?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s a saying, ‘A man who doesn’t eat a meal laid out before him is a disgrace.’ It’s a pity we spent the night together but I missed out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You promised you’d restrain yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, I’ve proven that it’s safe to sleep beside me, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">His smug expression made me angry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It doesn’t count because you were sick!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then should we sleep together again when I’m healthy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to back away in a hurry and nearly fall off the edge of the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Safe! Can you forgive me for this hug as a sleepy accident?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He quickly places his hand on my back and pulls me towards him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, I end up being fully embraced in his chest.</p>

<p class="calibre4">A moment of surprise, then a sense of security overwhelms me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I never knew it could feel so good to be this close to someone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You don’t seem to mind it that much.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He peeked at my face while smiling.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just your imagination!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How about staying like this for a while longer?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I found myself thinking it might not be so bad.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You hesitated just now, didn’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel like I’m being toyed with by someone younger…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m serious about this, not just playing around.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He says casually.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t deny his words anymore.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Who would have thought that a shared cold could lead to this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In a room filled with morning sunlight, the two of us laugh together on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I always thought it was okay not to force love, even if I felt lonely sometimes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I still don’t know if eternal love lies ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But the mornings we welcomed while laughing together like this felt incredibly happy.</p>
