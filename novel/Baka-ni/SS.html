<h1>Short Story 1 &#8211; Gone Fishing</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey Ullr, let’s go fishing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, fishing equipment in hand, went off to the river, his pet Ullr in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had been eating a lot of monster meat recently, so he decided to get some fish for a change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a while since we last took it easy like this&#8230;do you think we’ll catch anything?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito attached the lure, then swung the pole towards the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of that world’s fish were the same as those on Earth, so there was a chance to catch fish Reito was familiar with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven’t caught any fish I know yet, but&#8230;oh, a bite!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first hit came fairly quickly: Reito activated a physical boost support spell, then pulled up the fish.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes! I caught a&#8230;what’s that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SHAAAH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “catch” was a creature with shark-like face and human-like body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Reito pulled it up on land and removed the hook from its mouth, the creature cried as if protesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shashah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, er&#8230;I’m sorry…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strange creature, probably best described as a fishman, was apparently satisfied by Reito’s apology: it nodded and jumped back into the river, as if nothing had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr looked at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;let’s change places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided to forget the bizarre encounter and try fishing somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their new spot was near a large river in the vicinity of Lunot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water was fairly shallow, so there shouldn’t be creatures like the sharkman swimming around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, here goes&#8230;gotcha!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes after throwing in the pole, something started pulling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started reeling in the lure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The catch was pulling much harder than before, however: the pole almost flew out of Reito’s hands a couple times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-this is big…! Ullr, help me out!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr put his front paws on Reito’s shoulders, to help him stabilize. After a fierce battle, Reito managed to pull the fish ashore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nghah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito — and Ullr with him — fell backwards, dropping the fishing pole on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overjoyed, Reito quickly stood back up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did it!! So what fish&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hook was caught in the mouth of a two meter-sized octopus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An octopus&#8230;in a river…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was shocked by finding an octopus in a river, while Ullr curiously approached the catch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sniff sniff&#8230;ghah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh, Ullr!? Don’t irritate it…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr bit on one of the octopus’ tentacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hurriedly tried to stop him, to no avail: the octopus sprayed a defensive blast of black ink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPLASH!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“YELP!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr were doused in ink: the octopus escaped back into the river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two looked on helplessly, in complete silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;enough fishing for today&#8230;let’s take a bath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr “mumbled” an earnest request: don’t take me fishing ever again&#8230;</span></p>
