<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 3: A Relationship Like Waves</h1>

<p class="calibre4">“Today, too, the alarm stopped after the first ring.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s been a week since Reiyu Tenjō started having meals at my house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, her alarm would ring several times, but now it stops after just the first one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Incredibly, she also sends me a message even before I can get out of bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Reiyu: Good morning. Toast for breakfast today. Looks like we’re almost out of jam. Sad.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: Good morning, toast it is then.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can make as much jam as you want if we have the ingredients.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Reiyu: Really? Then, I’ll ask you again.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now she even expresses her own wishes, and our life rhythm based on the Neighbor Agreement has completely settled in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I make breakfast, eat with Tenjō-san, send her off, and then go to school myself with a bit of a time gap.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In the classroom, we basically pretend not to know each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I try my best not to talk to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But since she’s right there, it’s easy for her to talk to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei often starts conversations with me as a casual interjection.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, everyone! Some of you look sleepy, but did you all have breakfast? You can’t think straight if you don’t eat properly. This morning, I had toast with homemade strawberry jam, and it was absolutely delicious. Oh, Nishiki-kun, what did you have for breakfast?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even though she knew it, I watched her enjoy the same menu right beside me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I had toast with strawberry jam.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, what a coincidence!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Why does she deliberately say things that could reveal our secret?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, Reiyu-chan Sensei! You’ve been looking happy recently, did you get a boyfriend?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The leading girl of the class’s bright and cheerful girls group, Ririka Mayuzumi, sparkled with curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō is always perceived as bright and energetic, but now that I think about it, she does seem to be in higher spirits than before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s nothing like that. Now, let’s take attendance.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She deflected the casual question with a smile and focused on her work.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today, too, there were no late arrivals or absences.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even Akira Kuhouin, a habitual latecomer, had been arriving on time for morning homeroom since she was warned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, as days passed, her arrival to the classroom became later, and today, she was just on the brink of being late.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin was chosen to solve a problem written on the blackboard during the fourth-period math class.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She walked to the front of the classroom&mdash;&mdash;with a listless gait right in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She glanced at the problem, took the chalk, and smoothly wrote down the solution.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The equations and the answers were the same as the ones I had solved in my notebook, and her handwriting was neat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why are you looking at me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While dusting off the chalk dust from her fingers, she noticed my gaze.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just that Kuhouin is standing in front of me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m conscious of your gaze.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m just earnestly participating in class.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t look this way.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her eyebrows were raised, giving the eyes a sharp, pointed look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuhouin, you’re the one with a bad look in your eyes. Is it because of lack of sleep?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Lack of sleep often makes people irritable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m just annoyed because I was spoken to by a guy who’s always fawning over the homeroom teacher.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her unexpected retort caught me off guard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not always.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t deny it though.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re too smitten.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Kuhouin, you’re really paying a lot of attention to me…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? I’m not particularly watching you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you’re saying I’m always stretching my nose [fawning over someone], it means you’re always watching me, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I pointed that out, Kuhouin muttered under her breath, ‘Annoying guy.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">The math teacher gently told us, “If you’re done, please return to your seat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin glanced at me and then went back to her seat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the way, the answer Kuhouin wrote was correct.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Contrary to her delinquent-like behavior, Akira Kuhouin seems to be different from what Tenjō-sensei initially thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Curious, I approached Kuhouin’s desk during lunch break.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey Kuhouin, can I talk to you for a second?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sat down in front of her desk as she was about to stand up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“About earlier, I thought I should apologize. My bad.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s nothing. It’s just that Nishiki’s gaze is too lewd.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She turned her body away, indicating she wasn’t interested in talking with me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s an exaggeration. If anything, I’m rather supportive of you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I listened to her one-sided opinion with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Support?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuhouin, you’ve been making it on time in the mornings recently, right? Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It must be nice to offer support with just words.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her sarcastic comeback suggested that maintaining an early waking routine was challenging for her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, you’d be okay with me meddling beyond just verbal support?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Being teased is annoying.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked at me with a mix of irritation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m genuinely concerned about you as a classmate.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I sense ulterior motives.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As if a guy who’s smitten with the teacher doesn’t have ulterior motives. It’s like standard equipment for a teenage boy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A lust wearing a uniform.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not trying to hit on you, though.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I said with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s more possibility with a classmate rather than a homeroom teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have no idea how to make someone as prickly as you show a softer side.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin seems to be wearing armor around her heart, and I can’t find a way to get through.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s no reason for Nishiki to care about me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re so cynical. I just want Kuhouin to advance to the next grade.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why? You having an ulterior motive would be more believable.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san’s words from the other day come back to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『As a homeroom teacher, I’d appreciate it if Yuunagi-kun could help Kuhouin-san as a classmate if she’s in trouble.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">To fulfill that wish, I offer my help.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s hard to believe that someone who thinks it’s okay to repeat a year or drop out is serious about studying. If you’re genuinely struggling with waking up early, I’ll help you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If she wants to go to school but can’t, I don’t want to just ignore it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Whether my feelings got through to her or not, Kuhouin finally faced me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Help, like how?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had offered to take care of meals for Reiyu Tenjō, who was too busy with housework.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For Akira Kuhouin, who struggles to wake up, what could I do?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well… how about I give you a wake-up call?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No thanks.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was instantly rejected.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuhouin, you wouldn’t be late if someone woke you up every morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I said I don’t need it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Could it be that you actually live really far away, and that’s why you’re holding back?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She reluctantly answered with the name of the station where she lived.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s closer than my place…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was slightly taken aback. ‘Really, you’re late even though you live that close? Seriously, that’s way too lax.’, I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Apparently, my thoughts were written all over my face, as Kuhouin muttered reluctantly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I have low blood pressure, so mornings are extremely difficult for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So you tried your best to wake up, but it’s always just barely in time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that a problem?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Rather, I’m surprised you managed to participate in the morning practices when you were in the track and field club.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I wake up really early, my parents are still home before going to work, so they wake me up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, all the more reason for me to meddle. Your parents will cry if you repeat a year.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If my morning call could solve this, it would be a small price to pay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m already up at that time, preparing Sensei’s breakfast, so it wouldn’t be a hassle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s a problem for sure.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin made a very reluctant face, then muttered as if giving up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took that as a ‘yes’.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Let’s exchange contact information for now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I find it annoying to be contacted persistently.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll give you a wake-up call until you get up, so it will definitely be persistent calling.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s the worst.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t like my calls, make sure you wake up on the first try.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Just so you know, I’m incredibly grumpy in the mornings, so I might say something harsh, but don’t take it personally.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s definitely not the attitude of someone being helped.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“As always, you have such a superior attitude.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you’re going to refuse, now’s the time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At this point, I couldn’t help but laugh at her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now that she has agreed, I’ll take on the role of morning call duty with determination.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s hard watching you be late and get into trouble with Sensei, so I’ll take the job.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I honestly struggle to wake up with just an alarm, so maybe this is a real help.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good. It’s better to accept help honestly than to be stubborn. That’s what I did before.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira Kuhouin reluctantly exchanged contact information with me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">The next morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The alarm from next door stopped after one ring, and I received the usual morning message from Tenjō-san.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Reiyu: Good morning. I’ll go at the same time as yesterday.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: Good morning. Understood.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m grateful that Tenjō-san keeps in touch regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I also get up, finish getting ready, and start preparing the meal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Along the way, the alarm I had set on my smartphone the night before went off.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, now it’s time for the morning call.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had asked Kuhouin in advance for the time she needed to leave to be on time, I calculated backward from that and made the phone call.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The phone connected without much wait.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, Kuhouin, it’s Nishiki. Time to get up or you’ll be late.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…You really called.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">The voice that came from the other end of the phone was spiritless and sounded incredibly sleepy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The domineering atmosphere she showed in the classroom was completely gone, and her energy seemed at rock bottom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Looks like your weakness in the mornings wasn’t a lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…shut up.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She sounded like even speaking was a struggle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Being annoying is part of a morning call’s job.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Go get rid of my sleepiness quickly.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed barely able to think, just blurting out whatever came to mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Taking a shower might help you wake up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『I wish I could be carried from the bed to the bathroom…』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What kind of noble lifestyle is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『……..』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuhouin?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『zzZ』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t go back to sleep! Wake up! You’ll be late again!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…maybe humans aren’t meant to wake up early.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her statement was grand, but her voice was feeble. It was almost a miracle that a conversation was happening at all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tried speaking a bit louder, but it didn’t seem to have any effect.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, your sleepy voice is pretty cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I kept talking to prevent her from falling back asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『──don’t talk nonsense to me.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her response was languid, but there was a sign that she was turning over in bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m complimenting you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Do you think any girl would be happy just because you call her cute?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her response’s volume suddenly increased. Perhaps the word ‘cute’ triggered something.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m just saying a cute girl who’s making a cute voice is cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…Nishiki, you’re weird.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I record this call and let other boys listen, it would clearly prove that Kuhouin is cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Criminal.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her words began to carry more emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seems like the ‘cute’ approach is surprisingly effective.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just want to make Kuhouin’s cuteness known.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Mind your own business.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re complaining about a morning call you agreed to.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I say, holding back a laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『You’re meddling too much.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to that, I get to hear your cute sleepy voice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Pervert.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sure, sure, if you don’t like talking to a pervert, wake up earlier. Or are you pretending to be sleepy on purpose?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『I’ll kill you.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was a completely unconvincing threat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mumbling like that. Try it if you think you can.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『I’ll scream and burst your eardrums.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Announcing it first? That’s so kind. As expected, a cute girl is different.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…It’s seriously creepy when you keep saying it.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">It seemed like she was really put off.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re pretty harsh right after waking up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『It’s because of your creepy way of waking someone up.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just chose a way of speaking that seemed effective for Kuhouin.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『As if you’re my lover.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, does Kuhouin want to be sweetly awakened by your lover?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『──Ugh!? That’s just a hypothetical! Nishiki, you’re so annoying!』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Finally, she replied in a clear voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt like I caught a glimpse of her girlish side, so I couldn’t help but feel amused.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s no need to be embarrassed. It’s a lover’s privilege to be sweet with each other.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Shut up. Fine, I’m fully awake now.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira Kuhouin hung up the phone, sounding annoyed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I prepared breakfast on time, and my neighbor arrived just at the right moment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, good morning! So, what’s the menu for today?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She sat at the table with a big smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I tried something different today, Ogura butter toast.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, perfect. The sweet and salty taste is addictive.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This morning, Sensei too seemed to be enjoying her breakfast with a happy face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After finishing the meal and seeing off a cheerful Tenjō-san, I cleaned up and left my apartment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Checking the time on my smartphone and timing my train ride, I sent Kuhouin a message.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: Have you left home?】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Akira: Yes, I have. That’s enough already!】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: Just making sure.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Akira: You’re too suspicious of me.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a while, I sent another message.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: Are you on the train?】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Akira: Huh, what the heck!? Are you a stalker? Why do you know exactly when I’m boarding!?】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: It’s just a coincidence. Which car are you in?】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Akira: I don’t know. Probably somewhere in the middle.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">I arrived at the station nearest to the school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, I would walk to school from there, but this time I waited on the platform bench for the next train.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the next train arrived and the doors opened, Akira Kuhouin stepped off.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, glad you made it on time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki!? Why are you here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just making sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait, are you tracking my movements? It’s weird and really creepy to get messages at such precise times so frequently.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin looked genuinely alarmed, her sleepiness completely gone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I asked yesterday about how long it takes you from home to the station. As long as that’s correct, I can roughly estimate the times you pass through each point until you get to school.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why go to that extent?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I planned a schedule that allows Kuhouin to sleep as much as possible without being late.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, are you the type who can’t relax unless things go according to schedule? You know, controlling others like that can make you disliked.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked at me as if I were a bit of a creep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not that strict. Besides, it wouldn’t have worked if Kuhouin didn’t report correctly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just can’t stand not being on point with time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was a statement befitting someone who used to be in the track team.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I quickly followed her as she started walking ahead. We exited the station’s ticket gate and headed towards the school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why are you following me? Are you seriously stalking me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin, walking in front, complained.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s the way to school, so don’t be absurd. I don’t want to be late either.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel uncomfortable, feels like I’m being followed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll go ahead aand pass you .”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quickened my pace to close the distance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t like that either.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin, seemingly in a competitive spirit, also increased her walking speed, and we ended up walking side by side.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“As a former track team member, you hate being overtaken, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“──It’s not that. It just looks like we’re going to school together.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re just walking side by side.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It bothers me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re worrying too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel like we’re being stared at by everyone around.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since it was time for school, many Kiyō High School students were walking on the same path.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s right, they seemed to be looking in our direction.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that’s probably because Kuhouin is cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If a beautiful girl who is not usually seen on their way to school is walking there, it’s natural for people to take a glance or be conscious of her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin raised her voice in surprise next to me, causing me to be startled too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I told you the same thing on the phone this morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I thought I misheard you because I was half asleep.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin turned her face away with a ‘huff.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akira Kuhouin is a girl who stands out, it’s just a fact.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s creepy how you say such corny lines so casually.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed to have gotten goosebumps, rubbing her arms.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s surprising that Kuhouin isn’t used to such comments.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was absorbed in club activities, so love was my secondary concern. Makeup doesn’t make you run faster.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin said it matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That straightforwardness of yours, I think it’s good.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just being clumsy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s proof that you’re concentrating and working hard on one thing. That kind of thing is cool.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“────Nishiki, you just started talking to me so casually. You didn’t approach me with an ulterior motive, nor were you intimidated…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin’s voice softened a bit.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see, you are actually aware that people are intimidated by you…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but give a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re treated like a hot potato, you can’t help but notice a few things.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“With that strong personality and looks, and without being friendly, it’s easy to give off an unapproachable impression.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I made an objective comment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be precise, Akira Kuhouin in Class 2-C is seen as a beautiful girl who is admired by those around her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They’re intimidated, but she’s not disliked at all. She just always looks sleepy during breaks, so everyone is considerate and doesn’t bother her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Talking to such a troublesome girl…Nishiki, you’re an unusual guy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin finally showed a smile appropriate for her age.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that’s great. If Kuhouin approached others with that smile, the walls you feel would be easily broken down.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her eyes widened at my advice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you have sisters, Nishiki?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I do have a stepsister.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ahh, that’s why you’re good with girls. You womanizer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It didn’t sound like she was complimenting me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, I feel like I should be more popular.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My period of popularity, please come to me!</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, you seem like you don’t have many friends.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s something I don’t want to hear from you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong with that? Who decided that people with many friends are better?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira Kuhouin said this with a hint of a ‘hmmph’ in her voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a group where many are keen on reading the room, her ability to not be swayed by others is her strength.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, we happened to pass by the nearest convenience store to the school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what about breakfast? If you make a dash for it, there’s still time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that also according to schedule?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a bonus time because Kuhouin reported honestly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fine. Wait for me, Nishiki.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, I was going to go ahead to school first.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just stay there!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin pointed at me to wait and hurried into the convenience store.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How much does she hate the idea of me going ahead?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">True to her word, Kuhouin quickly finished her shopping and returned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Here, this is for you. Thanks for this morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And then Kuhouin handed me a chocolate bar, separate from her own breakfast.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, really, you shouldn’t have.”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00005.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to owe you anything. Just take it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She put it in my hand and started walking, sucking on a Chupa Chups.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Insisting on returning it would only spoil her mood.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“And by the way, calling me ‘Kuhouin’ is too long. Just ‘Akira’ is fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I even find my own last name too pompous. I prefer ‘Akira.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It makes me nervous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Calling a girl by her first name should come naturally to you. It’s pathetic otherwise.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin laughed at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But this is strictly as friends, alright?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt compelled to clarify.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“As a man, sometimes you need to be assertive. It makes it easier for the girl to make excuses too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What if I push too hard and end up being disliked?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s probably why you don’t have a girlfriend, huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her words hit me hard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girl walking beside me looked at me provocatively.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll keep this snack for later, Akira.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I put it in the pocket of my uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While talking like this, we reached the school before we knew it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">When the two of us arrived at the entrance, the class’s lively gal, Ririka Mayuzumi, called out to us in a loud voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Whaaat~ Nikki and Akiaki together? That’s rare!? Might be an unexpected pairing!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san approached us with curiosity while her trademark long twin tails bouncing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nikki, as in me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. ‘Nishiki’ just sounds like ‘Nikki.'”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I really didn’t get it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ririka. You still haven’t gotten over your habit of randomly giving people weird nicknames.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira visibly distorted her face in annoyance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aww, come on, it’s fun to have nicknames!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Annoying.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Akiaki, you’re as salty as ever.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s more like a pepper response than a salt one, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I added my own comment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like, spicily sharp.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, shut up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Glared intensely, Akira, now in her indoor shoes, quickly walked ahead.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Definitely more like pepper.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nikki, seriously, that’s so true!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san giggled.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Mayuzumi-san, were you close with Akira?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Last year, Akira, Mayuzumi-san, and I were in the same class too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I only knew them as classmates and wasn’t really aware of their detailed relationship.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I dunno? It’s more like Ririka just one-sidedly bugs Akiaki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The resilience of a lively person is incredible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If someone showed such an obviously unwelcoming attitude, normally people would give up trying to talk to them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a different sense than Akira, Mayuzumi-san is also a ‘go-my-own-way’ kind of person.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, Nikki, why are you with Akiaki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san’s face was full of interest as if she had caught a scent of gossip.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We just happened to meet at the station and walked here together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In a sense, I wasn’t lying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And if I freely mentioned her that I was giving Akira morning calls, Akira would definitely be annoyed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm~Take this!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san quickly snatched the chocolate bar from my chest pocket.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, that’s mine!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really Nikki’s?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is Akiaki’s favorite chocolate!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked at me with a knowing sly smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Knowing Akira’s preferences, I think she and Mayuzumi-san are quite close.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks. By the way, Ririka missed breakfast this morning. She really wants something sweet.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wonder if this was her way of asking for a bribe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Akira found out about this and complained to me, that would be troublesome.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Go ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yay! Thanks, Nikki!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sorry, Akira. It got taken.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After the fourth-period Japanese history class, Ririka Mayuzumi approached Tenjō-sensei.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Reiyu-chan Sensei, I have a little love advice to ask~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, Mayuzumi-san!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei was taken aback by the sudden request.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tried to leave to buy lunch before the love consultation in front of me started.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute! Nikki, you join in too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, me too? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want a male representative’s opinion too. That’s okay, right, Reiyu-chan Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If Mayuzumi-san doesn’t mind, I’m okay with it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I inadvertently made eye contact with Sensei.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine. It’s about Ririka’s friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Though it often starts as a ‘friend’s problem,’ it usually turns out to be about the person themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But in Mayuzumi-san’s case, I believe it’s exactly as she says.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, there’s this usually unfriendly girl, right? But suddenly she started going to school with a boy. That’s love, isn’t it? It must be love! It’s definitely love!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What a clumsy way to ask for an advice!</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s overly simplistic like elementary school kids declaring two classmates a couple just because they walk together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei also gave a wry smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mayuzumi-san, that might be a bit too much of a conclusion.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, but it has to be. Ririka’s woman’s intuition is super sharp!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you actually confirm with your friend if she likes someone?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not yet. That girl is actually quite shy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If your friend really likes someone, it might be better for outsiders not to interfere too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But if it’s serious, I want it to help out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not always the case that liking someone means wanting to date them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it harder to be in unrequited love forever? If things are made clear, then you can move on to the next love!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san’s opinion, in its simplicity, is hard to argue against.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Each person has their own way of thinking about love. You shouldn’t forcefully impose your views, Mayuzumi-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s definitely more fun to become lovers with someone you like!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hmm, they’re at a stalemate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Neither of them is wrong in what they’re saying.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you think, Nishiki-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you really asking me now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nikki, between Reiyu-chan Sensei and Ririka, who do you think is right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Both of their gazes were fixed on me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll vote for Mayuzumi-san. I think it’s better to have the person you like reciprocate your feelings.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yay, Nikki, you’re the best!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san patted my shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, you traitor.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei sent a reproachful look my way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not in cahoots with Sensei!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This isn’t a place to just respect the opinion of your superiors.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Since when did Class 2-C become a place where you can’t speak freely?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s an exaggeration.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No-no, Tenjō-sensei’s influence is significant.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really? Am I unknowingly leading everyone? I have to maintain the students’ autonomy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The second-year teacher began to worry seriously at my remark.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe I stirred things up too much.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Nikki and Reiyu-chan Sensei seem to get along well. You’re in sync.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san observed, changing the topic slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san said this, looking back and forth between us with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s simply because our seats are close, so we just have more chances to talk.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quickly denied any implications.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really? Most guys seem tense when they talk to Reiyu-chan Sensei, but Nikki, you’re just normal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei is, after all, just our homeroom teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? Reiyu-chan Sensei also seems relaxed when she’s with Nikki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san seemed unconvinced.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To steer the conversation back, I voiced my own opinion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, I think mutual love is the best too, but like Tenjō-sensei said, it’s not always true that being together guarantees happiness.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei, who had been taken aback by Mayuzumi-san’s remark, was now paying attention to my words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s too weak～ You won’t know unless you try dating, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s a very good point. Mayuzumi-san has nothing but straightforward opinions that are hard to refute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if you’re lucky enough to start dating, it might end up hurting you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you stay timid, even a love that could bloom will never bear fruit.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was sharply countered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Someone, please stop this love-slaying gal!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her truth is so suffocating.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ouch, that’s some harsh truth,” even Tenjō-sensei said so with a grim face.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mayuzumi-san. There are cases in the world where confessing only leads to more pain.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If it were easy to be aggressive in love, nobody would have any trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not about not being able to muster courage sometimes. It’s about calmly assessing the situation and choosing to restrain oneself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nikki, did something happen to you in the past? You should heal old love wounds with a new love!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Leave me alone!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san, clearly enjoying our exchange, narrowed her eyes like a crescent moon.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, stop! Continuing this heated debate on love won’t change anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei intervened with a referee’s stop.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s important are the feelings of those involved. No matter how much their friends get excited, it’s only a nuisance if it’s just the outsiders. For now, just watch over them quietly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh-okay, if Reiyu-chan Sensei says so…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san wilted at the words of the respected Tenjō-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps feeling sorry to let her go just like that, Tenjō-sensei offered more words of advice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You see, I have a friend from high school. She’s experienced in love and gives me advice and support, but she never rushes me or forces things. That’s why we’re still best friends as adults. Everyone has their own pace and circumstances in life. You need to understand and respect that. When your friend asks for help, then you can support them without hesitation.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay. Ririka will take a step back and watch for a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san left the teacher’s desk cheerfully.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll head back to the staff room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll go buy lunch at the school store.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I left the classroom at the same time as Sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Almost having been caught by Mayuzumi-san, we both looked exhausted.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is it okay to talk like this, considering the Neighbor Agreement?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She whispered, just loud enough for me to hear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just casual conversation while walking, so it should be safe, I guess?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I responded, hoping it was the right answer.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right. This is just casual chat.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As we walked side by side in the corridor, the conversation turned back to what had just happened.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You did well in convincing Mayuzumi-san, keeping her from meddling too much with her friend.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought that if our verbal battle with Mayuzumi-san had heated up any further, I definitely would have slipped up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s because I’m a bit more of an adult than the students, able to see things from a slightly broader perspective.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m no match for Tenjō-sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It seems like it would take quite a bit more experience to catch up to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder if I’ll understand Tenjō-sensei’s feelings better as I gain more life experience.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I wonder who the friend Mayuzumi-san was talking about is. Someone from our class?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Who knows? I have no idea.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should try to have a broader perspective.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, what a sarcastic comment. My eyes only see Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…You mean in terms of seating in the classroom, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Questioned, I recalled what I had just said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of, of course! I’m talking about a physical aspect!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ahaha, of course. I got a bit startled for a moment there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We laughed together but parted awkwardly midway.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">During dinner on Thursday, Tenjō-san reported with a beaming smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Recently, I’m happy that Kuhouin-san has stopped being late.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The morning call strategy was successful, and Akira Kuhouin’s tardiness dramatically improved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since I started making morning calls, Akira’s responses gradually lost their sleepy tone day by day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I hope it continues like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s all about habit. Once it’s established, it’s hard to break the rhythm of her life again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re proof of that, Tenjō-san. You’ve started waking up with just one alarm recently.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s really motivating to have a feast waiting in the morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t think I’m making anything special.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, no, I’m grateful every morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you for always finishing your meals so neatly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This had become a daily routine on weekdays, sharing the day’s events over dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today’s menu was rice and miso soup, pork ginger stir-fry with shredded cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, and cold tofu with plenty of condiments as a side dish.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san eagerly reached for the chopsticks, happy by what seemed like an energizing meal that boys usually liked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt that cooking was worth the effort every time I saw her enjoying the meal so happily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While dining with the innocent Tenjō-san, I noticed a grain of rice stuck near her mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you’ve got some rice stuck on your mouth.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Where?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Bottom left.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She reached for her mouth but couldn’t quite get it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Where? I can’t get it, help. Here.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She naturally brought her face closer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder if women with younger brothers naturally see younger guys as non-romantic options.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not wanting to show fear or hesitation, I extended my finger as instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I carefully removed the rice with my fingers, delicately pinching like tweezers and trying not to touch Tenjō-san too much.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There, it’s clean now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">But now, what should I do with this grain of rice?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…It’s actually kind of embarrassing. Being treated like a child by someone younger feels weird.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You were the one who asked. Why do you do this if you’re embarrassed?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I pulled out a tissue from the box and wrapped the rice grain in it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I thought it’d be okay since you patted my head before, but&mdash;&mdash;I ended up feeling nervous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Could you not say something like that while blushing!? Now I’m feeling embarrassed too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was just teasing you a little.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Either thoughtlessness or just being too relaxed, I can’t quite figure out Tenjō-san.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks to the Neighbor Agreement, we’ve maintained a reasonably close relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s honestly a relief that we’ve become able to interact without worrying about age or gender inside the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, in certain moments, both she and I inadvertently become conscious of each other as members of the opposite sex.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s why I get curious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What exactly am I, Yuunagi Nishiki, to Reiyu Tenjō?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“You keep showing me these kinds of openings…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s only inside the house! And I’m in a good mood today!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it about Kuhouin? You know, I’m the one waking her up every morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I blurted out those words before I realized.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, Tenjō-san put down her chopsticks.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked at me with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t comprehend her reaction to my words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, she had been in a good mood until just a moment ago, and now she seemed angry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not understanding the reason, I inadvertently fell silent.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, explain. Are you related to the fact that Kuhouin-san is no longer late?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was the one caught off guard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I just wanted praise, knowing that her joy was due to my own efforts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From my own vanity and a faint irritation within me, I had revealed the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She waited earnestly for my explanation with a serious look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to bear the awkward silence, I began to explain the situation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve been giving her a morning call every day. That’s why Kuhouin has been making it to homeroom in the morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“When? You’re also busy preparing meals in the morning, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just a quick call before Tenjō-san arrives. Sensei, you were also happy that your worry decreased, weren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stood my ground, believing I hadn’t done anything wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, no one was at a loss.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you really need to go that far, Nishiki-kun?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She questioned as if my actions were a bother.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just helped Kuhouin because Sensei asked me to.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Feeling as if my actions were being criticized, I defended myself a bit heatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san let out a small gasp.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;I see, that’s right. It was because I asked you to help.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Remembering her own words, she visibly slumped in disappointment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry I put you on the spot again. I’m really taking advantage of you, don’t I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san hugged her knees and curled up like a ball, emitting a gloomy aura.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing her more upset than I anticipated, I was confused.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I thought Tenjō-san would be happy too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was happy. I thought finally my words had reached a student, but maybe I was mistaken…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san, still hugging her knees, rolled over and lay on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed like she was sulking because I had taken credit for her initiative.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But still, Yuunagi-kun, you seem quite close to Kuhouin-san, making phone calls and all. Ah, you were in the same class last year.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The homeroom teacher, talking in an exaggerated tone, lay on the floor of the student’s room, curled up like a pill bug.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know about that too?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m the homeroom teacher, after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I only exchanged contact information with Kuhouin for this matter. Nothing more, nothing less.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly corrected myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You are kind to girls in trouble, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Only her large eyes were looking at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you deny that, it would shake the very foundation of the relationship between me and Tenjō-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san slowly moved back to her original position.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t think it’s a good idea for our conversation here to affect our outside behavior.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you talked about the strawberry jam in the classroom too, so it’s mutual, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hoped she would let it slide, but Tenjō-san wasn’t willing to let go.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it’s my fault because I was the one who let my guard down first.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was concerned about her attitude of taking all the blame herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I need to cool my head a bit. Sorry, but I’ll go back to my room tonight. Apologies for leaving the dinner.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Without looking back, she quickly left the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the first time she had left a meal unfinished.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…..”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t bring myself to finish dinner either and just lay down on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After staring blankly at the ceiling for a while, I came to a conclusion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did I unknowingly gotten in the way of her..?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ugh, my concern had backfired.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was left with nothing but frustrating and unresolved feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san probably wanted to solve it by herself.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Did I act too pretentious? If I had hurt her pride as a teacher, it made sense why her attitude changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how well-intentioned I was, if Tenjō-san didn’t want it, it was meaningless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was indeed an unwarranted meddling.</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a sigh, I regretted my actions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe it would have been better if I hadn’t done anything at all.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I hope she doesn’t start talking about terminating the Neighbor Agreement…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had grown quite accustomed to our semi-cohabitation life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A secret relationship outside of school on weekdays.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As per the initial rule we set, we spent weekends separately.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought we had clearly delineated our personal and private lives.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But living together and seeing each other day and night, perhaps both of us had unconsciously become accustomed to various things and loosening and blurring the lines.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The room felt colder with Tenjō-san’s absence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My small room suddenly seemed too spacious, and only quiet and boring time flowed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was reminded of my solitude for the first time in a while.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a bit lonely now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Such a feeling was a first for me since leaving home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The days with Reiyu Tenjō, less than a month in total, seemed to have completely changed me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō had too much influence on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Feeling lonely in someone’s absence was, in a way, a proof of yearning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">The next morning, Tenjō-san woke up at her usual time and sent me a message.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Reiyu: Good morning. There’s a staff meeting this morning, so I won’t need breakfast.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is this her avoiding me? Or maybe…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Either way, the timing was bad, and it made me worry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While still thinking about last night’s incident, I called Akira for her morning wake-up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira answered immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I ended the call after hearing her cute, sleepy grumbles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, I would prepare breakfast, but I didn’t feel like cooking just for myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I toasted some bread, spread the last of the strawberry jam on it, and ate standing in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The freedom of living alone means no one to scold me for my manners.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sitting on my bed and sipping coffee aimlessly, I realized I had missed my usual time to leave for school and hurriedly grabbed my uniform jacket before heading out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I winced at the heat of the sunlight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s almost like summer, even though it’s only the end of April.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The sun shone mercilessly, oblivious to the calendar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t put my arms through the sleeves of my jacket, instead carrying it under my arm as I walked to the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took the train and arrived at the nearest station to Kiyō High School.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki. You’re late today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even though I arrived one train later than usual, Akira was waiting at the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lately, I have been going to school with Akira without planning it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her competitive hostility had completely vanished.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, you don’t seem energetic today. Are you okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it because of me? Does waking up early for the calls bother you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira looked at me probingly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Unusually considerate, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I guess I do feel a bit guilty for having you call me every morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, maybe. I guess I don’t need to call Akira anymore.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Considering the incident with Sensei yesterday, this might be a good time to stop the morning calls.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh, no way. Nishiki, you’re my lifeline.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her modest attitude from before vanished.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Akira, you need to develop the habit of waking up on your own.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But you helped me to become like this, so you have to take responsibility until the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re not going to make me wake you up until you graduate, are you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It wouldn’t be out of character for Akira to say such a thing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is it okay for me to repeat a year?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That kind of threat, really?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Abandoning a classmate, Nishiki, you heartless person.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A little kindness has turned out to be quite costly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then ask someone else for help. Like Mayuzumi-san, for example.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ririka is a bit too high-energy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mayuzumi-san is a good person. She might agree easily.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, Akira moved in front of me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, do you like girls who are assertive like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are we talking about my preferences?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just answer me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What should I say?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well… I guess I get curious at people who are earnestly working hard.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Naturally, Reiyu Tenjō comes to mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. Girls who are fully committed to something often feel like they don’t have the capacity or time for romance and might find a boyfriend more of a hindrance. You’d need quite a charm to stand a chance, Nishiki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira was quite blunt in her conclusion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, what’s your type of guy, Akira? You could probably get a boyfriend if you tried.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m tired of trying to fit in. I find monkeys who ogle at women chest and drool disgusting. Also, I hate it when guys act all high and mighty. In short, romance is just troublesome.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can agree with that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s why someone as laid-back as Nishiki is just right.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just right for what?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Dependence.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re pretty blunt about being dependent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Or a parasite.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Both means pretty much the same.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even though I give you snacks every morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked at me with a ‘Are you dissatisfied?’ expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, I feel a bit guilty for taking something every time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Today, I received another chocolate bar from her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Or would you prefer a Chupa Chups instead of chocolate?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was always sucking on a lollipop for her sugar fix in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Akira held up the Chupa Chups she was licking to my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s clearly half-eaten.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Indirect kiss. You’re welcome.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not welcome. What were you going to do if I had actually taken it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh. I’d be surprised, but, well, if it’s Nishiki, it’s just about okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks, I guess.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, you’re actually happy about it. That’s hilarious.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe I really should stop the morning calls.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, I like you, I rely on you, you’re a great guy, you’re the best.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t just throw compliments out of nowhere. It sounds insincere.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At least try to act convincingly. It’s too much like reading from a script.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what do I need to do for you to keep calling? Want something sexy?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira casually lifted her chest with both hands.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing in public?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly cautioned her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Self-promotion. I’m a bit confident about my chest. It suddenly grew after I quit club activities.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Pick the right person for that kind of thing. You’re too careless.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am picking properly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira looked at me with a cool smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Akira?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Since I started helping her, I could tell she wasn’t a bad girl.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, you’re so naggy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t want me to nag, learn to wake up on your own. That would end everything.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I gave up on trying to reason with her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s impossible!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira, for some reason, beamed a wide smile and made an ‘X’ with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was a bit envious of Akira Kuhouin, who could so openly show her weaknesses.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō seemed the same as always as she began the morning homeroom upon arriving at the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It appeared to be a hot day, and her forearms were exposed as she took off her jacket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She spread smiles and took attendance with a lively voice, her face fixed towards the back of the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From the moment she entered the classroom to the end of the roll call, she didn’t let her gaze fall on me, who was right in front of her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Aha, it seems she’s completely planning to ignore me today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If that’s her intention, I have my own plans.</p>

<p class="calibre4">” (staring intensely&mdash;&mdash;）”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stared at Reiyu Tenjō persistently, almost like a form of harassment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A super intense stare from close range.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Let’s see, Reiyu Tenjō, how long can you keep your cool face?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Show me if you can endure this pressure.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Today is as hot as summer again. According to the weather forecast, it seems the Golden Week will be similarly warm, so it might be just right to go to the beach and play in the waves.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As Tenjō-sensei asked, responses came from all around the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our homeroom teacher continued her casual conversation, infuriatingly unaffected by my gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The word ‘waves’ she mentioned, however, perfectly encapsulated our relationship.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The distance between Reiyu Tenjō and me is like waves, drawing near and then receding.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I think we’ve gotten very close, suddenly she feels impossibly distant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What was calm suddenly became intense. Constantly changing and never still.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, I find the waves sparkling in the sunlight irresistibly beautiful, and I can’t help but keep watching them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey-hey, Reiyu-chan Sensei, aren’t you a bit low on energy today?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ririka Mayuzumi pointed out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? I’m as energetic as always.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It kind of looks like you had a fight with your boyfriend and are feeling down?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m certainly not her boyfriend or anything, but why is Mayuzumi-san subtly sharp?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just your imagination. I’m not dating anyone right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her declaration of being single set the classroom abuzz.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Tenjō-sensei left the lively classroom, she glanced at me one last time with a meaningful look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed like she had something to say about my intense staring earlier, but this time, I pretended not to notice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">The incident happened that night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since it was Friday night, it would normally be the day to have dinner in my room, as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, since Tenjō-sensei hadn’t sent any messages, I couldn’t decide whether to prepare dinner or not.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could have just asked her, but somehow, her attitude from the afternoon was still lingering in my mind, and I couldn’t bring myself to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Intending to rest on my bed when I got home, I unexpectedly fell asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What woke me was a piercing scream, like silk being torn.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s that!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hastily sat up, trying to locate the source of the scream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stood up and turned on the light in my room. The small screams continued incessantly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s coming from Sensei’s room, isn’t it? Is she okay…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was obviously not something trivial.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even now, I could hear the sounds of thrashing and commotion from the other side of the thin wall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Screams of “Eeeek!”, “Aaah!”, and “No!” didn’t stop.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Should I call the police? No, it’s not yet confirmed as an incident…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I hesitated, the intense sounds from the next room continued.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll just check what’s happening.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As an excuse to understand the situation of my neighbor, I pressed my ear against the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s definitely Tenjō-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought, recognizing her voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why are you coming here on your own! Stop it, just stop!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei was clearly rejecting a ‘third party.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">“──Damn, what am I hesitating for!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">So far, Tenjō-san has come to my room, but never the other way around.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a matter of basic courtesy, a line not to be crossed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had no intention of breaking it on my own accord.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unless Reiyu Tenjō specifically asked for something, I should never intrude.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mistakenly thought that such an understanding attitude was mature.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But now, I felt like a child sulking over my own failures.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As long as I harbored a sweet yearning for the adult woman Sensei, I was merely looking up to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Remaining passive and getting swayed by her reactions would keep me forever seen as a younger, unreliable person.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Our age difference would never close.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But if I genuinely wanted to support her, I needed to show I could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her as a person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To prove I could be steadfast even if she entrusted me with everything.</p>

<p class="calibre4">To learn from my mistakes and take initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I dashed out of my room without even putting on sandals.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san! Are you okay? Please open the door!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I furiously pressed the intercom and knocked on the door of room 103, her adjacent room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, the door swung open with force.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stumbled backward as if pushed away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Help me!”</p>


<p class="calibre4">I caught Tenjō-san, who had burst out crying in her camisole.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was surprised that a grown woman could easily fit into my arms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Feeling her close to me for the first time felt incredibly right.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was different from the common thrill or emotion of touching the opposite sex.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a special feeling that made me certain there could be no substitute for her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Realizing this, I could no longer lie to myself.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00002.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">I desperately didn’t want to be apart from the person in my arms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wanted to protect her, the one with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why is this happening to me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san looked up at me, her face streaked with tears.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, what happened?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had completely forgotten about last night; I just wanted to help her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san seemed unable to walk properly as if her legs had given out, so I quickly took her to my room for refuge.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you for coming. I thought I was going to die&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was so exhausted that she could barely speak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as she entered my room, she collapsed at the entrance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t think you’re bothering me by coming for dinner today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I said it before Tenjō-san could apologize.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“────I actually wasn’t planning to come tonight.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This morning too, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It really was a staff meeting this morning!… and after behaving like that, I couldn’t bring myself to go have breakfast.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was troubled too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Were you upset because I secretly helped Kuhouin?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, as a teacher, I’m obviously happy about it… It’s more like I was jealous of you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She muttered, sounding frustrated.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Jealous of me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because you effortlessly solved a problem that had been troubling me as a teacher. It’s like I’m useless even though I’m a teacher.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In short, Tenjō-san is in a bad mood because she feels defeated that my help has improved Akira Kuhouin’s tardiness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m relieved, I thought Tenjō-san hated me. So it was jealousy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Realizing the truth, I too sat down at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the narrow entrance, we sat side by side, almost shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Still, Kuhouin-san trusts you quite a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m just a convenient alarm clock.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“About her, don’t you think Kuhouin-san is cute?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That question was cruel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There’s nothing sadder than when a woman you are interested in does not consider you as a member of the opposite sex.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What will you do if I admit that I do? “</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…If you like her, then I’ll support you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her beautiful face was close by. A single tear she had shed earlier was still clinging to her long lashes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but gently brush it away with my finger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san turned towards me, and I couldn’t help but complain.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re going to be jealous, I’d rather you be jealous about me interacting with women other than Tenjō-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Well, at least I know I could never easily come to dislike you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you mean…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I mean like a younger brother. It would be strange for me, as a homeroom teacher, to be jealous if a student got along well with other female students. We’re just neighbors, after all. Ah, let’s add a new rule to the Neighbor Agreement: if either of us gets a romantic partner, the agreement ends immediately.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san rattled this off in one breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was reminded of a stark reality. Yuunagi Nishiki was, after all, just her neighbor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could help with daily life, but I couldn’t truly be a support for her in a deeper sense.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At least not as things stand now.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Should we have some tea in the room?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stood up first.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then we sat in our usual spots and calmed down with some cold barley tea.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what happened?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…That thing, it appeared…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked horrified to even say it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That thing! You know, that black thing!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was as expressive with her gestures as ever, but this time I didn’t understand her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So you weren’t talking about an ex-boyfriend, a stalker, or a suspicious person in your room? I thought it was a matter for the police.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t need the police, and I’ve never had a boyfriend!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She confessed, her face turning bright red and sounding slightly angry. She tends to let things slip in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was getting irritated at my slow understanding.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Seriously! You’re usually so perceptive. You know, that thing with long antennae, shiny black, and moves too fast, don’t make me say it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah. It was a cockroach&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I hate even hearing that name&mdash;&mdash;!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san’s scream cut off my words as I began to say the first two syllables.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She covered her ears with both hands and shook her head violently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She must really detest them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Never utter that name again! Got it!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her eyes were so intense it felt like she might actually kill me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Understood. I’m just glad you’re not in trouble or anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt let down and deflated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, essentially, a cockroach(gokiburi)──or rather, a ‘G’ had appeared in her room, so Tenjō-san had panicked to that extent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They must have become more active with the warmer weather.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“To me, it’s a major incident! An emergency under the same roof!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve taken proper measures against them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Traitor!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s an unfair accusation.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, let’s defeat the G! This is a matter of life and death. All-out war with no holds barred!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san naturally tried to involve me in her mission.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll lend you some insecticide spray, feel free to use it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This way, I wouldn’t need to enter Tenjō-san’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I brought it from the cupboard and placed it in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Good luck with your G-hunt!</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t do it alone!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She keeps whining. I gave her a weapon, but she wouldn’t even touch it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just aim at the target and spray. It’s easy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t look at the enemy!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Overcome it with instinct or your mind’s eye.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to become a master of dealing with them, and I can’t! Yuunagi-kun, you’re being too cold!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m really hesitant to enter a woman’s room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please, I’ll allow it! Help me! Please help me get rid of it! Neighbor Agreement, Clause 2! Help me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She pleaded with a serious expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her moist eyes looking up at me made my heart race.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Having you as my neighbor must have been for this very moment!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s interpreting things a bit too conveniently.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, I’ve been seriously bad with bugs since I was a child.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t be so cold as to abandon her now, and I can’t leave a woman in trouble alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I head to the adjacent room 103.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Be careful, you never know where it might come from!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t stick so close; I haven’t even opened the room’s door yet. It’s hard to move.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san clung to my back as if using me as a shield. She was pressing her body against mine quite closely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because of this, my steps became as cautious as if I were playing a zombie game.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s hard to get rid of them with her clinging to me like this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I-I’ll cover your blind spot, so don’t worry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice was trembling, and she didn’t seem like she’d be much help.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, Tenjō-san was unconsciously pressing her chest against me. That was more distracting than the G.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knew visually she was quite endowed, but now I was vividly feeling it against my back. Combined with my imagination, my mind was in a festival state.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I never knew the real thing could be so soft.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the one hand, I want to savor this unexpected happiness for even a second longer, but I can’t just stay still.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I swallow my tears and turn back to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, I will definitely get rid of the G. So please wait in my room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s embarrassing if someone of the opposite sex is alone in my room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought I was not being treated like a man?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not true at all!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right, a man like a younger brother…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Being like a younger brother and being a real younger brother are different things.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When that’s clearly stated, I end up being conscious of her again, despite trying to be just a neighbor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pretend to be calm, continuously telling myself it’s just pest extermination.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright. Then let’s go together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I say, reaching for the doorknob.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“W-wait a minute!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-I’m not mentally prepared.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’ll be fine, just leave it to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…fortunately, you’re reliable.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“──Excuse me for intruding.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Finally, I step into Reiyu Tenjō’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m surprised by how different the room smells.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Can the same layout feel so different just because the person living there is different?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I take off my shoes at the entrance and proceed down the hallway.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The hallway is somewhat dim because one of the bulbs is out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I cautiously proceed, holding out the insecticide spray like a pistol.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A black shadow quivers above the washbasin. I quickly aim the nozzle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that’s my swimsuit. I hung it up after wearing it today, and that thing appeared, so I left it hanging.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san explains with an embarrassed voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was silly of me to be alarmed by the swimsuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I step into the brightly lit room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Your room is neat, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You said before that you weren’t very good at tidying up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei’s room is really tidy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had thought it would be cluttered, but it’s not.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only signs of life are the pajamas carelessly left on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There are girlish plushies and a body pillow by the pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The floor is covered with a fluffy rug, and there’s a round table with cushions around it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Along the wall, there’s a TV, a small desk set, and a bookshelf filled with history books befitting a history teacher.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t stare too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This is my first time entering a woman’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though she’s my teacher, she’s also an older woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a purely romantic event, this might lead to a deeper relationship between a man and a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a man, it’s something you might hope for.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, standing in the face of someone who was genuinely frightened, this G extermination task has no hint of romance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How about it? Is it here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t see it at first glance.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please make sure you find it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, please don’t cling to me so tightly. It’s distracting.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Should I check under the table and in the gaps between furniture? Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I began searching every nook and cranny of the room for the G.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It felt a bit like being a detective.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">It was my first time thoroughly searching someone else’s room like this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I meticulously checked everywhere within sight, but there was no sign of the G.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It doesn’t seem to be here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was definitely here!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, it might still be hiding somewhere we haven’t checked yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It might have escaped outside the room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If Tenjō-san is satisfied with that, I can leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I decided to leave the insecticide spray with her, just in case.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t go!” she pleaded desperately, grabbing my sleeve.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The only places we haven’t checked in this room are around the bed and inside the closet.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hesitated to search those places as a man.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can’t you handle those areas yourself?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Uh, no, can I ask you to do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright, no complaints later.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As Tenjō-san watched, I proceeded with the task.</p>
<p class="calibre4">First, the bed. It was nerve-wracking to step into a woman’s sleeping area.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I cleared my mind of distractions, especially trying not to focus on any scents.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I moved pillows, duvets, stuffed animals, and body pillows aside, checking thoroughly in the gaps between the bed and the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no sign of the G there either.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, it’s the closet next.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This was an even higher psychological hurdle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is it okay to open it? There’s nothing inside that you wouldn’t want me to see, right?”, I double-checked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine. I won’t be able to sleep tonight if we can’t get rid of it today!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed resigned to the necessity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I prepared myself and opened the closet.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The drawers inside were left open, revealing a row of colorful underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They seemed to be mostly of a rather sexy and stimulating design.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, the size of the bras seemed quite large, making me wonder about the cup size out of pure curiosity.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, not the underwear!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A flustered Tenjō-sensei cut in front of me, closing the drawer with her hips while blushing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Feeling awkward, I dropped my gaze to the floor&mdash;&mdash;where I saw a black shadow crawling.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There it is!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way! Ahh!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As the G scurried across the floor, Tenjō-sensei screamed and clung to me again.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait, it’s suffocating.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do something&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t get rid of it yet!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Eventually, after a commotion of spraying insecticide all around the room, the G was exterminated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We ventilated the room, and I wrapped its corpse in multiple layers of tissue before disposing of it in my room’s trash can.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She said she couldn’t stand to have it in her room, even if it was dead.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I returned to Tenjō-sensei’s room to report that the task was completed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s all done.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, you really saved me…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei’s expression finally relaxed, but she still stood as if she didn’t belong in her own room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re worried, you should thoroughly take precautions again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wait! Can you check the other places too?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She held me back. I had spoken too soon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tension returned to Tenjō-sensei’s face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since it’s come to this, let’s do it thoroughly. First, I’d like to look for a possible way in. Can I check under the sink and such?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Find them! And if there are any others, make sure to eradicate them completely! I’ll only accept total extermination!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright-alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I went on to inspect the water areas.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Crouching down, I looked under the sink, illuminating it with my phone’s light, but everything seemed normal.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei was certainly capable of housework.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There were a variety of cooking tools and seasonings, but they didn’t seem to have been used recently.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Keeping the water areas clean can prevent them, so not cooking much has actually helped in this case.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I also checked around the sink and stove, but there didn’t seem to be any issues.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no indication that they were attracted by leftovers or dirt. Everything was well-cleaned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Any signs?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not so far.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then where did it come from!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure. This room being on the ground floor makes it easier for them to get in.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I wanted a room on a higher floor too, but this was the only one available that met my criteria. I was short on time, plus it had a separate bath and toilet, and the rent was a bit cheaper.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Complaining doesn’t help, but it’s common to have to compromise due to practical reasons.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t sleep in my room like this tonight, can’t you do something about it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked so distressed that she was on the verge of tears again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite her age and dignity, she was genuinely troubled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And unfortunately, I’m not heartless enough to just leave her be.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Maybe we can keep the water areas clean again and place new preventive items in likely entry spots.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then let’s do it! Right now! Securing my room is the top priority!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was unusually assertive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I checked the time on my phone. If we hurry, we can still make it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The drugstore is still open. I’ll go and buy new items right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Usually, these preventive items are for one-time use, so there’s no stock.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll come with you. It hasn’t appeared in your room, has it, Yuunagi-kun? I’ll buy the same items. And we’ll settle this today, no matter what!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her eyes were resolute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Uh, you’re coming with me? I’m fine on my own.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is a problem with my room. At least let me carry the bags.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not that heavy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m too scared to wait in this room alone. Just let me come with you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And so, I ended up going out for night shopping with my next-door neighbor because of the black intruder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Walking through the quiet residential area on a Friday night with my homeroom teacher felt strange.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The area was quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one else was around, it’s just the sound of our footsteps.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It feels weird, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was the first to voice this thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m walking outside with her, dressed in a hoodie over her loungewear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe that’s why I feel a little closer to her now.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Yuunagi-kun, don’t you like Kuhouin-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asked this with full confidence but completely off the mark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are we back to that topic? You’re persistent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But Kuhouin-san is cute, isn’t she? There are quite a few boys in the class who steal glances at her during class.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She approaches with an attitude that says, ‘Come on, try consulting with this Onee-san.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Has the cockroach(Goki) incident messed up your head?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t even abbreviate it! Don’t ever mention that name!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She smacked my arm.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, Tenjō-san, your love-life savvy seems pretty low.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How rude. I’ve never had a boyfriend, but I’ve been confessed to plenty of times.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Given that there’s no intention to brag too much, it’s probably true that Tenjō-san is not interested in love.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nevertheless, I am curious about her views on love.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, give me advice on how to date someone I like.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san, with a knowing look, elaborates on her method for successful romance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Love is a short battle! They say women stop seeing a man as a romantic interest if too much time passes after meeting. So, the key is to meet and talk a lot in a short period to turn on the other person’s love switch.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s a ‘love switch’?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I immediately ask.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, it’s about making the other person feel excited, I guess?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How exactly do you make someone excited?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I rapidly fire another question.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you rushing too much!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m just asking for advice, Onee-san. Now, please answer me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I kept pressing for an answer with a laugh, not giving her time to think.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, you can’t answer without thinking?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, you’re being a bit mean.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? Besides, your earlier answer was just something you heard from someone else, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How did you know!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei was surprised by my guess.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Because it doesn’t sound like you’re speaking from experience.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My love-expert friend is the one who told me that advice, so it’s not wrong. Frequent interactions are super important!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t practice it yourself?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re poking at a sore spot, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei looked up at the night sky, trying to divert the conversation from herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Have you noticed something?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s been almost a month since we started having dinner at my place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">During the day at school, at night in my room, I talk to Reiyu Tenjō more than any friend or family member.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…The woman I interact with the most is Tenjō-sensei, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō is undeniably beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Many are drawn to her, but they understand that their relationship can’t develop beyond a certain point.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She and I belong to different worlds from the start.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We just happen to be in close proximity during this particular period of our lives.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I should be satisfied with the fortunate chance of being near her and having conversations with such a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A charming person can make those around them happy just by being there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;drive them mad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe I’m just one of those people too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I put it into words, the emotions I had been suppressing in my heart began to stir.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My heartbeat quickened, pulsing intensely. My mind felt feverishly hot, trying to block rational thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not just driven by physiological desire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Removing rational limitations like the age difference, status, and common sense, my honest feelings for Reiyu Tenjō, as just a man and a woman, were clear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi Nishiki sees his teacher as a realistic romantic interest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her every expression shown through our days together&mdash;&mdash;laughing, crying, being happy, anxious, angry, pleased, surprised, and laughing again&mdash;&mdash;all of them are dear to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My love switch had been turned on long ago.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I am hopelessly in love with Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei swallowed her breath and froze.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed like she couldn’t catch up with the shocking realization that the common sense she had always taken for granted had suddenly been overturned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Should I say it again?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turned back to her, who still hadn’t moved, and asked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No! It’s okay! I heard you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She hurried to catch up with a stiff expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed she was shaken.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah～～uh, no-no, someone older like me is definitely out of the question.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei fluttered her hands as she vehemently denied it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder why she gets flustered like this despite not being interested in younger guys.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wish she would play it off more jokingly if she’s trying to feign ignorance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She should dismiss it with the composure she shows at school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her half-hearted reaction makes me want to expect something from her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Look, no matter how much we eat together, it’s like being almost family, right? I’m in the position of a reliable Onee-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s difficult to think of Tenjō-san as an Onee-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry for being unreliable…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t sulk. I like you just the way you are, Tenjō-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop teasing an adult!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m just being honest.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That makes it worse! I can’t take it seriously when you say it so casually while we’re walking down this night street!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh? If the situation was right, it would be okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s good to know. I’ll make use of it someday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not about that!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Am I bothering you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right now, it’s a problem whether I get too close or stay too distant from you! That’s the only thing that’s clear!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I knew it, my relationship with Tenjō-san was like the ebbing waves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Always in contact, yet the boundary is unclear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We can’t draw a definitive line to make things black and white.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if this kind of answer is a bit unfair,”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She mutters as if mocking herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not at all. Thanks to that, I can stay close to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If Reiyu Tenjō was as perfect and flawless as she appeared, I probably would never have gotten involved in her private life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s quite ironic.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;That kind of thing can lead to misunderstandings with girls.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Never mind! “</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before we knew it, we had arrived at the drugstore, and Tenjō-san sprinted ahead.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay! Now that we’re here, let’s end this topic! Understand?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san swiftly turned around and pointed at me firmly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The lights of the store behind her illuminated her figure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though it was night, she seemed dazzlingly bright, and I squinted my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Upon entering the drugstore, we threw all the necessary cockroach control supplies into the basket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we were about to head to the checkout, I stopped in front of another shelf.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you still have something else to buy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The light bulb in your hallway was out, so we might as well buy a new one.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re very observant. Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san nudged me with her elbow as if to say, ‘good job.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, but do you know the size of the light bulb?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Our apartment layouts are the same. The fixtures are identical.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Remembering which one fits is quite impressive, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve changed it before.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I added the light bulb I picked out to the basket.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I always think about buying one, but I always forget. Thanks for noticing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If the hallway was brighter, I wouldn’t have mistook the swimsuit for something else.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That area, especially near the bathroom, had been dark, so it was firmly etched in my memory.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really? Or did you actually just get excited by the swimsuit?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She teased, peeking into my face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just go and pay the bill, please.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aha, you’re trying to dodge the question.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…well, as a guy, swimsuits are a special case.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. If you join the swim club, you’ll see them all the time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san said this and headed to the register.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Certainly, Tenjō-san has a great figure, so she must look good in a swimsuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The highly functional, tight, thin fabric that wraps around her enchanting body undoubtedly emphasizes her toned figure and feminine curves.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just imagining it is intense enough, so I wonder if I could stay calm upon actually seeing it.</p>
