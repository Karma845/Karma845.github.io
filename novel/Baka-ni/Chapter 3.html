<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Airis’ instructions, Reito and Ullr arrived at a village — or more precisely, what remained of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It showed the same signs of mayhem as the village they visited after leaving the Abyssal Forest: the villagers’ corpses were strewn everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only difference was the presence of survivors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey&#8230;are you an adventurer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!! They finally sent help?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody!! Someone came to save us!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, no, I&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Reito entered the village, he was surrounded by a group of wounded villagers. They were all injured in some way, but they could apparently move without too much trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito asked about what happened in detail and received the following explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of armed Goblins broke through the barrier and started rampaging throughout the village. They took all food supplies and weapons. The villagers who barely managed to survive hid in the food storage under the elder’s house. Some escaped the village, but they were likely dead.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-40483264' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-40483264' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the villagers spoke to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you an adventurer? Did the Adventurers’ Guild accept our request, then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry, I just happened to pass by. But I have food and water with me, I’m willing to share it if you want&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito imagined that this was the reason why Airis told him to bring plenty of food and water: the villagers reacted with joy and surprise to his proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-is that really true? You’re a savior&#8230;those bastards threw corpses in our well, so we can’t drink that water anymore&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;please form a line, I’ll start giving it out now. I can use recovery magic on any wounded too&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh!? Are you a Healing Magician!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, Support Magician.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whaat? Support&#8230;that hopeless job!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, watch your mouth!! We might as well owe our lives to this boy!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the villagers frowned when they heard of Reito’s job, but one of the elders rebuked them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito paid no mind to their words: he started distributing food and water and healing the wounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recovery Boost”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh&#8230;my legs are healing…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“F-father…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh&#8230;thank you so much, you saved me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her father’s twisted leg return to normal, a girl embraced Reito while shedding warm tears. The father too thanked Reito repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, the villagers did not know if they could trust a “hopeless” job holder like him, but after witnessing the effects of his healing magic, they overcame their prejudices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After distributing the food and healing the majority of the wounded, Reito proposed to help them move to a safe location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survivors were exactly 12 people: Reito would escort them to the nearest village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is there a carriage large enough to fit everyone in the village?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I’m sorry, there are only ox-drawn carriages left&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito nodded to the apologetic villager, then turned towards Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s more than enough. My buddy here will pull the carriage, so please tell the women, children and elderly to get on. I’m sorry, but the men who can walk will have to follow on foot. We’ll take a break and rest if you need it, so please don’t be afraid to say if you’re tired.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-thank you so much!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t bring too much luggage, but if there is anything you absolutely cannot leave behind, I’ll keep it for you. Please make preparations as soon as you can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers obediently complied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they were making their preparations, Reito used his Alchemist skills on the carriage, to change it into a form Ullr would have an easier time pulling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the villagers were ready, the group left for the nearest village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way there, Reito learned that the village’s name was Aphein and received a gift from the villagers as thanks for saving them. Reito refused to accept money, however, and received metal tools and items left in excess in the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also received a Barrier Stone and Decay Stone, tools with the power of keeping monsters away. They were both rare magic stones which could be sold at a very high price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, sir adventurer, over there, that’s the village of Aferre!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village of Aferre was surrounded by walls and guards were standing at the gates. As soon as they saw Reito’s convoy, they approached quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C-could you be coming from Aphein!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank the heavens, someone survived!! Come in, quick!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-87035411' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-87035411' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go inform the elder!! Bring food and water too!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aferre villagers eagerly welcomed Reito and the villagers from Aphein: they were immediately led to the village elder’s residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder provided all villagers with a warm meal, then listened to their story. He then came closer to Reito and acted as if whispering to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;it was those armed Goblins’ doing, was it not…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito replied to the elder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The village was already ransacked when I arrived. I brought the survivors here for the time being, but&#8230;what will you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are welcome to stay in our village. Unfortunately, however, more and more survivors are gathering here&#8230;all of them from villagers attacked by Goblins. To tell the truth, we cannot rest easy&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are so many people coming…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than Aphein, many other villages in the area had been attacked, apparently. Most of the villages had already been destroyed, with their survivors seeking shelter in Aferre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aferre was protected by walls and magic stones to keep monsters at bay, so it was relatively safe, compared to other villages in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing shelter for the increasing number of survivors, however, had created a new issue: lack of food supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Aferre village had petitioned the royal army to exterminate the armed Goblins, but the army was still investigating the Goblins’ whereabouts, so they had not moved yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also sent a request to the Adventurers’ Guild, but as they could not offer much as a reward, no one had accepted it yet, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have also asked any passing adventurers to help us, but they all refused when they learned that we couldn’t offer a proper reward&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village’s offered reward was indeed far too low for the scope of the request: 30 silver coins, approximately 300,000 Yen. (TL note: circa 2750 USD)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the deadly risks involved, it was an unreasonable amount.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accepting the request would mean staying in the village for a long period, protecting the villagers from the armed Goblins and defeating them. The enemy’s numbers were unknown and could attack at any time. If the Goblins did not come during the adventurer’s stay in the village, the reward would become half too. Lodging was provided for free, but because of the village’s lack of food supplies, meals would come at a price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no wonder that most adventurers refused to accept such conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty silver coins were an attractive reward for novice adventurers, but for veterans it was nothing to marvel at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could not blame the adventurers for ignoring the village’s request. He too thought the reward did not compensate for the risks — yet, he could not find it in himself to leave the villagers to their fates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it possible to cancel the request you have sent to the guilds? If you can have the money back, I’d like to undertake the request&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-do you really mean it!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wish for the conditions to be changed, though. I will accept only if the request is to strengthen the village’s defenses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village elder was baffled by Reito’s proposal, but eventually accepted it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be frank&#8230;the village’s defenses are pretty poor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-my humblest apologies&#8230;we never expected monster attacks, so&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After examining the village’s surroundings, Reito felt rather downhearted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brick walls protecting the village had been erected dozens of years ago: the passage of time caused them to crumble in many spots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some cracks were large enough for an adult human to pass through. The largest gaps had been covered with wooden planks, but any monster could have broken through easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito also found out that the bricks themselves were rather frail and the walls were just two metres high in certain spots: using the gaps between the bricks, even children could climb over them. Goblins, which possessed physical abilities higher than humans, could break through in no time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito asked a question to the elder while checking the walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you ever considered digging a moat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A moat&#8230;sir?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A moat, outside of the walls. I think it would be enough to protect the village, even with walls like these&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the guards interrupted Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aaaah, I can’t listen to this anymore!! Boy, you make it sound like it’s so easy, but do you have an idea how much time and effort it takes to build something like that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have thought about digging a moat before, but&#8230;to dig one surrounding the whole village would require manpower we honestly do not possess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guards spoke the truth, but Reito had an idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed his palm at the ground in front of the walls and casted a basic grade magic spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earth Block.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what the!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The ground is&#8230;rising…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earth Block” was a basic grade magic spell that manipulated earth through the use of gravity. Reito used it to create a small mountain, which he pushed uniformly against the walls to reinforce them, while creating a ditch along the walls at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;what do you think?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A-amazing&#8230;so you were a talented magician!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-sir magician!!! Please forgive our rudeness earlier!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t help but smile at the guards’ swift change of attitude.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-78898141' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-78898141' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry about it, really&#8230;more importantly, could you tell anyone with time on their hands to gather here? I’d like to ask them to help dig the moats a bit deeper.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes sir!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guards immediately gathered any available adults and had them start digging the moats around the village walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could have done the job himself with magic, but it would have taken a toll on his magic power reserves. Because of that, he had the villagers take care of the finishing touches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few hours later, the over four meters deep moat around the village was completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the basic grade spell Earth Block, the village’s defensive walls were fortified, their multiple cracks and damage sealed and repaired. The Barrier Stone and Decay stone, which were only set on the walls before, were now embedded in a way they couldn’t be destroyed easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village’s external defenses thus improved, but Reito was still concerned. No matter how strong the defenses were, if the village’s military forces were lacking it wouldn’t mean anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito approached a group of villagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How many soldiers are there in the village?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have about 20 guards. If we count everyone with battle experience, it’s 20-30 more. The enemies are not normal Goblins, but powerful, organized forces that destroyed many villages already, aren’t they? I doubt people like us could&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t give up before we fight, please!! What weapons do you have?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The guards have theirs, that’s about it. Ten swords and five lances, plus five bows. We have some wooden weapons for training too, if that helps.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should also have farming tools like sickles and hoes, right? Kitchen knives can work too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With all due respect, sir&#8230;do you suggest we fight with them? I doubt farming tools and kitchen knives will be much useful against monsters&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll take care of that, don’t worry. Gather everyone capable of fighting and all tools you have, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes sir!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guards did not look convinced, but they listened to Reito’s request nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They promptly gathered all villagers with battle experience and the tools Reito asked about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito planned to use the wooden training weapons and tools to make new weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He used Metal Transmutation and Shape Change to turn sickles and hoes into short swords and lances, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then tied the kitchen knives on the tip of the wooden lances, using forks and knives &#8211; turned into nails &#8211; to hammer the knives on the lances, creating impromptu knife lances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After preparing the weapons, Reito instructed the guards and villagers how to use them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the survivors who fled to Aferre had lost their family or home to the armed Goblins. They naturally resented them deeply, so there was no shortage of villagers eager to fight.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days had passed since Reito first arrived in Aferre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The walls surrounding the village had been strengthened further, the moats expanded, the village warriors became stronger: they trained every day to fight the Goblins, under the guards’ guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito too assisted the villagers and patrolled the surroundings every day. His objective was not only the village’s safety, however: his true first priority was to find the traitor hiding among the villagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the middle of the night: the village was completely silent, its inhabitants sleeping in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and the soldiers were standing guard on the outer walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Survivors from villages attacked by Goblins continued to trickle into Aferre, but strangely enough the armed Goblins seemed to ignore only that village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldiers chatted as they stood guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;not one Goblin in sight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s true&#8230;but we can’t let our guard down. They will come to this village eventually&#8230;all other villages in this area have been ravaged, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly, it’s a mystery to me&#8230;it’s like they don’t want to come here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to you, sir Reito, our defenses are much stronger than before. Even those dangerous Goblins can’t win against us!!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-27224760' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-27224760' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do hope you’re right&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito observed the surroundings while talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There wasn’t the slightest hint of unusual activity. Even if he activated the Assassin skills Night Vision and Observing Eye, he could not find anyone suspicious. Not even Detect Presence could pick up anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!? Sir Reito, that Ullr snuck out of the stables again!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the soldiers spotted the approaching Ullr and called Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, I’m sorry&#8230;I’ll put him back in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha!! I wonder if he’s complaining about having to sleep in the horse stables, even if he’s a dog?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahaha&#8230;hey buddy, let’s go back&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hopped on Ullr and told the soldiers he was going to leave for a little while.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The direction he headed to, however, was not the stables where Ullr slept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon enough, Reito reached the village elder’s residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;okay. Ullr, you wait here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s fine&#8230;bark if anyone suspicious comes here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito whispered his instructions to Ullr as he stood in front of the residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then used Shape Change to turn a knife into a key and unlocked the entrance</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Soundless Walk and Stealth skills, in order to move silently and unnoticed, and quickly entered the residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder had no family and lived alone in the residence. He had been living like this ever since his wife and children had been killed by monsters, several years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why Reito snuck inside the residence was to speak with the elder without anyone else knowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He quickly reached the elder’s bedroom and put his ear on the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder was definitely inside: he seemed to be still awake, as Reito could hear him murmuring softly. He then opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon my intrusion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…w-what!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please, don’t make a fuss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eek…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder, sitting on his bed, was shocked and surprised by Reito’s sudden entrance. He saw Reito draw the knife at his waist and retreated against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito didn’t let the elder out of his sight as he looked around the room, searching for something. He found a letter on the desk next to the bed and his gaze became sharper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you really are the traitor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what!? N-no, don’t!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reached for the letter. The elder tried to stop him, but Reito dodged and tripped the elder, making him fall on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito scanned the letter’s contents and sighed.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-82035267' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-82035267' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This letter&#8230;is from the pro empire faction, isn’t it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought something was wrong here. If you really were desperate, your request to the guilds wouldn’t have conditions as strict as those. I asked around and, as it turns out, you were the one to set those conditions. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Aferre was not a wealthy village, the request’s conditions were simply unrealistic. Reito found it suspicious and contacted Airis to know more about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he learned was a shocking revelation: the elder was actually connected to the pro empire faction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to find out the truth, Reito continued working on the village’s defenses on the surface, while keeping track of the elder’s movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder, however, always had other people with him, so it was not easy to approach him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is where Ullr came into play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stables where Ullr slept were located next to the elder’s residence. Reito had obtained permission to use the residence’s stables for Ullr to sleep in, but the real reason was for Ullr to keep watch on the elder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started interrogating the elder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is there a letter from the pro empire faction on your desk? Are you a member?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-no!! Don’t group me with the likes of them!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why would you be connected with ‘the likes of them’, then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had already learned the truth from Airis, so he already knew more or less what was going on. Nevertheless, he wanted to know about the relationship between the elder and the pro empire faction from the man’s own mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder let out a deep sigh, then started talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-they threatened me&#8230;one month ago, one of them came here&#8230;he snuck into my residence, just said “in the near future, the villages around here will be attacked by Goblins” and left. From the next day, survivors actually started coming to this village&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did that man tell you about such a thing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what I want to know!! Afterwards, that man promised the Goblins wouldn’t attack this village, as long as I reported about the survivors who came here&#8230;and until now, the promise has been kept.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have been communicating via letter, then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what else could I do!? If I didn’t follow his orders, everyone would be killed!! Do you have an idea how many hundreds of people live in this village!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that’s why you sent a request no adventurer would accept?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-that’s right&#8230;everyone would find it suspicious if I didn’t send a request, but if adventurers really came, those people might do something&#8230;I have no idea why they’re doing something like this, anyway. I feel guilty for what I have done&#8230;but there is no other way for us to survive!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder answered Reito’s questions, a grave look on his face.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had done everything he could, even tried contacting the royal knights or the guilds, but the servants he sent with the letters never came back. The village’s horses, one of their few means of transportation, were poisoned and killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, the elder thought he was under constant surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-sir adventurer&#8230;I know I have done something unforgivable&#8230;but could you please not say anything of this to the others? Or we will all be&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That would not solve anything. Besides, how long will your food supplies last?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the stream of survivors, Aferre’s population had grown considerably, causing the village’s food supplies to decrease at a very high pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aferre’s original population of less than 100 was now over 300, after all. The stream of survivors flowing in the village increased every day too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good-hearted elder could not refuse entry to the survivors, which only increased his anguish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village’s food supplies were going to last for a few more days at most, but only a select few villagers were aware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder, terrified of the pro empire’s faction surveillance, spent sleepless nights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Reito arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have to worry, sir. There are no pro empire faction members in this village any more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-how can you be sure of that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because they plan to come to this village tomorrow — to massacre all of us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gave the elder a letter, different from the one he found on his desk. The elder took it, not without suspicion, and quickly scanned it. His face then went wide-eyed in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I can’t&#8230;what is the meaning of this!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Among the survivors who took shelter here, there were members of the pro empire faction. This report was among their possessions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter stated the village’s food supplies were running out and that there was a hidden escape route in the southern wall, prepared so that the villagers could escape when the Goblins attacked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report suggested using the secret path for the Goblins to penetrate the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I caught a suspicious person and found this report. He was probably the member tasked with watching over you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-does this mean that&#8230;they never had any intention to keep their promise!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe so. According to the report, the Goblins will invade the village tomorrow night.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-damn it!! Those bastards&#8230;are going to kill us all!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They planned it from the start, I’m sure. This village’s location provides an ideal destination for the survivors from other villages: they left it for last to kill as many people as possible in one sweep.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-68257326' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-68257326' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damned louts…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elder, realizing he had been deceived, hung his head down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then retrieved the *fake* report from his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, that was all Airis’ plan. What happened next too mirrored Reito and Airis’ predictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito convinced the elder to confess his secret to the villagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people were lost and confused, at first.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the elder did for the pro empire faction was only reporting about the refugees who came to Aferre. He also never turned any of them away. Lastly, he was under watch by the faction. The fact that he tried to contact the royal army for help was true as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the basis of such circumstances, his punishment was deferred to a later time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a graver issue at hand: the following night, the armed Goblins were going to invade the village through the secret escape route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some suggested sealing the secret route, but Reito instead proposed to take advantage of it to ambush the Goblin army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was actually leading the pro empire faction’s movements too: he knew perfectly how they planned to attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had swapped the elder’s letters to the faction, in order to feed them wrong information: a false report stating that the royal army was going to come to the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon receiving the report, the pro empire faction thus decided to attack the village earlier than planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invading forces were composed of thirty Goblins and two Monster Tamers leading them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faction was already aware of what happened to Basil in the Ymir mines, so they ordered the Monster Tamers to move in pairs, for added safety. Aferre was the last in the list of villages this pair of Tamers was ordered to attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was time for the Monster Tamer pair to move out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, several hundred people resided in the village of Aferre. The majority were villagers without battle experience and the soldiers guarding the village were only about twenty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per usual, the Monster Tamers planned to stay in a secure location and have the Goblins perform the actual mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, however, they were not only facing villagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The involvement of the passing adventurer Reito became the factor that sealed their fate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;hey, what’s going on here? There weren’t any moats last week, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You idiot, did you even read the reports? Some weird adventurer got the villagers to dig one. But he’s just a useless Support Magician, there’s nothing to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haha! Right, right, now I remember&#8230;those poor fools must have gone mental to rely on a shitty job like that&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was late night when the two Monster Tamers arrived at a hill overlooking Aferre, about one kilometer from the village. The Goblin troops were standing by too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the Goblins had physiques similar to adult humans: there also were three Goblin Knights among the troops. The Goblins were standing in a circle around the two Tamers, as to protect them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, what do you plan to do? The walls are easy enough to climb over, but the moats seem deeper than expected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No problem, we just need to use the escape route written in the report. No way twenty soldiers can guard a village as big as that. If we can get close without them spotting us and get in through that hidden route, we’ve as good as won.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leave that to me, then. You watch out so those huge things don’t go out of control.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. But be careful&#8230;don’t let your guard down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Loud and clear&#8230;let’s get moving!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man raised his voice and the Goblins around him reacted: twenty of them followed him towards the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the hill remained ten Goblins, three Goblin Knights, and the old Monster Tamer they encircled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man whispered to himself while reading a letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway&#8230;I never heard anything of the village improving their defenses to this point. That elder better not be thinking of tricking us&#8230;no, that can’t be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man doubted the elder for a moment, but quickly changed his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was the one who decided to kill people closely related to the elder when the latter sought assistance outside the village, to serve as a warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man actually possessed a very special Job other than Monster Tamer,</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If anything happens, I can just flee by myself&#8230;only another Assassin can hope to find me if I’m hiding, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man had absolute trust in his other Job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was born, he already possessed unique Assassin skills, the job most proficient in stealth activities: thanks to these abilities, he had escaped deadly situations several times already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man, however, had yet to learn…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;that in the village there was a boy, raised by an Assassin for ten years, who had abilities on par with genuine holders of that Job…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Monster Tamer, named Shuu, approached the fortified village with Goblins in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he predicted, the village seemed heavily guarded on the surface, but lacked manpower. There was not even one soldier standing guard on the walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He carefully observed the moats for any traps, then proceeded cautiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here it is&#8230;man, those idiots better not hope they did a good job hiding it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghee&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret entrance was hidden by a wooden plank, as stated in the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu grinned, then ordered the Goblins to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch, it’s too small to carry any large weapons inside&#8230;whatever, have the small ones go in first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghee!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Shuu’s orders, the Goblins armed with battle axes or spears put down their weapons and entered the one meter wide hole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goblins could fight on par with average Humans even if unarmed.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-13558335' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-13558335' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu was confident that they could easily overrun the village even without their weapons, so he only sent the smaller Goblins in first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rest of you start climbing the walls&#8230;hm? What’s this? Earth?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu failed to realize it at first, because of the darkness, but a closer look at the walls revealed that the surface was covered in hardened soil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surface was thus too slippery to climb on, so Shuu gave up on that plan and decided to leave it all to the Goblins who fit through the hole. He faced the secret opening again, when something unexpected happened in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? What the&#8230;whoa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeeeh…..!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black smoke emerged from the hole. Shuu peered inside, to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with the screams of Goblins, the pungent smell of burning flesh attacked his senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu quickly realized that the villagers had likely poured oil or something similar in the hole and set it on fire. The small Goblins who entered the hole were thus burned alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn, it was a trap!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Too late!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu turned towards the voice’s direction — on top of the village walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he realized it, twenty villagers were standing on the wall, all armed with bows made by Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers shot all their arrows at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waaaahhh!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gyeeh!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their target was not the Goblin troops, but Shuu, their controller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins shielded their master with their bodies. Taking advantage of the confusion, however, another group of villagers climbed down into the moat with a ladder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kill them all!! Don’t leave even one alive!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll pay for attacking our village!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t let them escape!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what the hell!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu was too shocked and bewildered by the unexpected developments to move: the villagers who climbed down in the moat, spears in hand, charged the Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Die, you bastards!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwheh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal iron spears could not pierce the Goblins’ armor: the villagers’ weapons, however, had been reinforced by Reito with Metal Transmutation, thus rendering them capable of penetrating the Goblins’ helmets and armor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the Goblins fall one after the other, Shuu panicked and tried to flee, but it was too late: he was already surrounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then yelled to the Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-shit!! Get me out of here!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheee…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You aren’t going anywhere!! We’re not scared of you!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Target this man!! The monsters won’t move if we get him!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monsters bound via Covenant Magic obeyed their master’s every order: if the latter was in danger, however, their absolute priority was to defend them.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-47004811' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-47004811' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers on the walls set arrows in their bows and let them fly towards the Tamer: the Goblins thus surrounded their master, in order to protect him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so the Goblins themselves became defenseless, so the villagers armed with spears could attack them without fear of retaliation. Other villagers also threw stones at the invaders from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get out of our village!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to protect our home!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Die, you bastards!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-damned peasants…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeeehhhh!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins protecting Shuu eventually fell to the repeated attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The villagers’ attack power was far lower than any adventurer or royal soldier: with enough numbers and preparations, however, they could prove a match for the monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuu did not have any particular fighting abilities other than his Monster Tamer skills, so he could only curl into a ball before the villagers’ offensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eeeekkk!! P-please, spare me!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWAAAHHH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant Shuu’s pitiful shout echoed in the surroundings, the last Goblin shielding him collapsed, falling on its master’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at Shuu, squirming under the Goblin’s weight, the villagers cheered loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had successfully defended their village, without a single casualty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, on the hill overlooking Aferre…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Monster Tamer, Gaida, was growing increasingly frustrated: no matter how long he waited, no message came from Shuu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan was to join Shuu in invading the village, after the latter sent the signal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaida eventually decided to move: he jumped on one of the Goblin Knights and headed towards the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the…!? What’s going on!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeeh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shit!! Run faster!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds of fighting could be heard from the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Gaida realized he couldn’t hear any villagers screaming, he hurried closer to Aferre, in order to assess the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he could arrive, however, a shadow appeared before him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AWOOOOO!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYEEEH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wolf suddenly appeared in his way, howling loudly. Before Gaida realized it, the wolf — though its size was closer to a horse — had jumped one of the Goblin Knights, pushing it to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a moment of panic, Gaida realized they had been ambushed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, he heard a boy’s voice from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey there!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaida looked up and found a boy, standing on an Ice Block platform — Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito jumped down, broadsword in hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaida, perceiving the approaching danger, jumped down from the Goblin Knight he used as a vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s broadsword swung down on the monster.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWEEEHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blade of Reito’s broadsword smashed through the Goblin Knight’s helmet, and the monster’s massive body fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaida was surprised for an instant, but quickly gave orders to the other Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You lot, get him!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeeeehhhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the Goblins attacked at the same time, but Reito activated Muscle Boost and stood his ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flame Lance!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyaaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito shot the flaming lance to the approaching Goblins: the others too stopped in their tracks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a single moment of hesitation proved fatal: Reito did not miss the chance to swing his broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gweeeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeeeeeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s horizontal sweep sent two Goblins flying. His momentum did not stop there, however: with the second rotation he struck another Goblin, destroying its armor and cleaving its body in two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One more!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyaaaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHEEEHHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito targeted one of the Goblin Knights with a rising slash: fresh blood gushed from the monster’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Goblin Knight, equipped with armor for Giants, could not endure Reito’s blade: the giant monster slumped to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks of fear and terror were painted on the Goblins’ faces: Reito, however, continued to mow them down.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-36869940' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-36869940' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaaahhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYEEEHHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spinning like a top, Reito cut down Goblin after Goblin.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the last rotation, Reito stopped for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only remaining Goblin was the Goblin Knight pinned on the ground by Ullr. That battle was about to reach its conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAHHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GYEAHHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s fangs tore the monster’s neck as the Goblin Knight screamed. Blood spurted from the wound, mercilessly ripped wider by Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Wolf stepped away from the Goblin Knight, spat out the monster’s flesh he had bitten and returned to Reito’s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito glanced at his partner’s blood-stained face, then looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Monster Tamer Gaida was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought of relying on Ullr’s sense of smell to track him down, but the latter was also looking around puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then realized his opponent had to have used a Stealth skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So he was an Assassin…? Guess we’ll have to give up&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed and rubbed Ullr’s back, then turned towards the village&#8230;but the next instant, he quickly turned back again and swung his broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;as if!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWAH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s broadsword struck Gaida, standing behind him with a dagger in hand, and sent him flying spectacularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s broadsword was dull, so its sharpness was inferior to a regular sword. If he held back, he could use it as a bludgeoning weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Gaida’s ribs were cracked because of the blow, but it had not been a lethal blow. He landed on the ground, a look of shock on his face, and managed to whisper a question despite his fading consciousness.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-how did you&#8230;know where I was…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had a hunch&#8230;I guess?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-ridiculous…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his life in the Abyssal Forest, Reito had gained the ability to perceive incoming danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ai&#8230;cecream, please.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Have you finished the&#8230;ah, you tricked me!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Wahaha!! You replied normally even if I didn’t say Airis!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You cheeky brat…!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Anyway, yes, it’s over. With him, we’ve taken out three of the Monster Tamers.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito communicated with Airis while carrying the unconscious man on his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Monster Tamers of the pro empire faction had thus been defeated. There were now only two controllers of the armed Goblins left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had asked the Aferre villagers not to kill the Tamer, so he managed to capture them alive this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Two more, then&#8230;we should return to the guild first. Because of this accomplishment, you will probably be promoted, Reito.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s good, but&#8230;do you think these two know where the rest of the pro empire faction is?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I doubt it. Ultimately they are just pawns, so they are not given any truly valuable information. But one of the two remaining Tamers, the man called Gain, is different. He is one of the faction’s executives, after all.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The man Basil talked about&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had taken out three of the five Monster Tamers already, but Gain was clearly going to be not so simple an opponent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『By the way, what’s going to happen to Aferre now?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The person who prevented them from contacting other towns or cities is gone. The village will be safe now, help will come very soon.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aferre’s troubles were all solved, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was nothing else for Reito to do there, so he decided to return to the Adventure City Lunot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What should I do once I’m back in the city?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You should simply bring those two to the guild and explain what happened. Bal will take care of the rest, so this case is basically over.』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-20733168' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-20733168' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Heh? It’s over? What about the other two Tamers?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Things went well until now, but the pro empire faction will become very suspicious because of the disappearance of their three Monster Tamers. You stood out too much in Aferre, Reito: the faction is surely going to find out about you. You should leave the rest to the guild and go back to leading a normal life.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, I feel there’s something off about all this&#8230;but yeah, it’s not something I can solve all on my own&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You have defeated three of the controllers of the armed Goblins, so you have done more than enough, really. Besides, your initial objective was to acquire experience in fighting against humans. Let us leave the rest to other people.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, you’re right&#8230;got it!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not fully convinced, but decided to take Airis’ advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people of Aferre showered Reito with thanks and gifts. He refused to accept money this time too, however, and took a horse carriage instead: it could be pulled by Ullr and used to camp outside without worrying about the weather. It would also be useful to carry large quantities of luggage and, if equipped with a Barrier stone, could prevent monsters from getting too close.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was looking at his new carriage, very pleased, when the villagers came to thank him again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you so much, sir Reito&#8230;we will never forget this, as long as we live…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t think too much of it, I just did my duty as an adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are too humble, good sir. Our village is safe now only thanks to you!! If anything happens, please visit again. I don’t know if we can do anything to help, but you will always be welcome here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahaha, thank you. Be well, everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sir Reito!! Thank you so much!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The carriage thus departed, pulled by Ullr. Shuu and Gaida were loaded on the back, their bodies tightly bound with ropes, grim looks on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it all&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, Ullr, and the two captured Tamers thus headed towards Adventure City Lunot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s involvement in the case would end when he handed them over to the guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As suggested by Airis, Reito had decided to leave everything else for other people to deal with and return to a normal life.</span></p>
