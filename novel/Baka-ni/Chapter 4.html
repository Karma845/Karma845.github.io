<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4: Rain</h1>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san!?” “Yuunagi-kun!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was Sunday afternoon, a day after the G incident.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We happened to meet inside a supermarket near the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Living in the same area, it’s natural that we’d use the same shops.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, it wasn’t impossible that we might run into each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, meeting in a place that’s neither home nor school feels odd.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looks cute in her casual clothes today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not the formal suit she wears at school nor the relaxed home wear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her spring-like, light-colored, thin dress paired with a denim jacket and her long hair casually tied at the bottom in two places made her look younger than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It seems we’ve chosen similar outfits. Like a matching pair.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was also wearing a denim jacket over my shirt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If it bothers you, I can take it off if you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m fine with it. It’s surprisingly cold inside the supermarket.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We started walking, as standing around would be in the way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is everything okay at your place since then?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. I burned the smoke thing yesterday, so my home’s defenses have significantly improved.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you ever have any trouble, feel free to ask me for help.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Next time, I’ll run to you before I scream. Are you shopping, Yuunagi-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Were you going somewhere, Tenjō-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, just like you, I’m out for groceries.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your nice outfit made me think you were out for fun. It suits you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you. But it’s just my usual attire.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe it looks good because of who’s wearing it and what she’s wearing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Flattering me won’t get you anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Being in a supermarket, of course Tenjō-san’s shopping basket was filled with groceries.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I could have cooked for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got a bit of free time thanks to you. Thought I might cook for myself on my day off.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can eat whatever you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just so you know, I have absolutely no complaints about your cooking! Just to be clear!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san hurriedly corrects my casual remark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is there anything you’d like to eat later? I can buy the ingredients.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, what should I choose? I actually look forward to seeing what you’ll come up with each time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That much?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a great motivation for work.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I must put in more effort.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Yuunagi-kun, is there anything you’d like to eat? I could share with you tonight if you want.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We smile together, recalling how we met.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You don’t have to push yourself too hard. You should rest properly on your day off.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a way of returning the favor.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel bad about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, let’s go with the classic meat and potato stew!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I hesitate, Tenjō-san decides on her own.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, we haven’t made meat and potato stew yet, have we? Maybe I should try it too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey-hey, what’s the point if you’re the one who makes it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She lightly slapped me on the back.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wouldn’t you be excited if the Onee-san next door brought over her classic meat and potato stew?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d be super excited.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll do it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san quickly went back to get the necessary ingredients, and I followed her around the store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After that, we finished our shopping and left the supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since we live in the same apartment, we naturally took the same way home.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Walking through the shopping street near the station, I was attracted by the word ‘croquettes’ on the front of a butcher’s store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was snack time, and I was a bit hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking at Tenjō-san, she seemed interested in the croquettes too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The butcher’s wife noticed us standing together and called out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You there, the couple, try these freshly fried croquettes, they’re delicious. How about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">” ” Couple!? ” “</p>

<p class="calibre4">At that sales pitch, Tenjō-san and I looked at each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do we look like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe she misunderstood because we’re dressed similarly and carrying big bags of groceries from the supermarket.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a mismatched combination, but that’s some aggressive salesmanship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, in customer service, how much you get noticed by the customers is important.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since we’re here, why not try the freshly fried ones?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I agree.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then Tenjō-san bought croquettes for both of us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, your hands are full, so it might be hard to eat while walking.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can go ahead and eat it first, Tenjō-san. It’s freshly fried.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should taste it too. Here.”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00012.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san offers me the croquette at my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you saying I should eat it like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it’s best eaten while it’s still crispy and fluffy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s embarrassing, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No one’s watching. Come on, eat it before it gets cold.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t resist the temptation of the freshly fried treat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s bad manners to eat food like this, but I decide to bite into it boldly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Occasionally, Tenjō-san feeds me as we walk back to the apartment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How does it taste?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I say, careful not to burn my mouth as I eat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, it really is good. I’ve never had it before because the shop is usually closed when I return.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Store-fried foods are mostly delicious. Trying to fry at home still seems like a high hurdle for me though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, even you have things you’re not good at, Yuunagi-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve only been living alone for just under a year.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would be a big deal if you could deep-fry food well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, are you expecting me to be good at it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll leave that interpretation up to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would be impressive to improve by summer vacation. Plus, frying in summer…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…? Why is there a deadline until summer vacation?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, about the moving…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Feeling apologetic, I recall what we had agreed upon during our ‘Neighbor Agreement’.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah… Yes, that’s right. We did make that promise.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it’s a problem, please don’t force yourself. After all, I should be the one who…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s an adult’s responsibility to take on such troublesome matters.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san puts on her teacher’s face and looks up at the sky.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…hey, looks like it’s going to rain.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Despite the morning’s sunshine, I realized the sky had become overcast.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you check the weather forecast? It’s going to rain today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What!? My laundry is still hanging out!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just then, a drop of rain falls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the rain intensifies and quickly darkens the asphalt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, Tenjō-san! I have a folding umbrella with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s close by, so I’ll be fine!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then let’s run!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We hurried along, gripping our shopping bags tightly in the increasingly heavy rain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was only a few minutes to the apartment, but the rain grew fiercer by the second.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t running pointless at this point?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I call out while getting drenched.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just hung up all that laundry I had accumulated! I don’t want to have to wash it again!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Seems like Tenjō-san is determined not to give up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t slip!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The asphalt is completely wet and glistening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our apartment comes into view.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun! Sorry, can you help me? There’s quite a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We open the door to room 103 and rush in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without worrying about wetting the hallway, we dash through the room and open the windows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Working together, we hurriedly take down the laundry hanging on the drying poles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once everything is stored inside, a pile of laundry forms on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, we take off our wet jackets.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wow…everything’s soaked. Looks like I’ll have to rewash them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is there anything I can help with for laundry?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I offer help to a dejected Tenjō-san.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In what world would there be a female teacher who lets a male student hang her underwear!? Is this some kind of play?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I mean, except the underwear of course. It would be awkward for me too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I calmly retort.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, do you actually have no immunity to men?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? I’m not. I don’t have a problem with you approaching me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I reflexively step back as Tenjō-san suddenly comes close and gets worked up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not seeing where I was stepping, I kicked a trash can unintentionally. Then I lost my balance and fell to the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to brace myself, I hit my back and felt a dull impact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A voiceless groan escaped me, and in the discomfort of pain, all I could do was grimace and close my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, Yuunagi-kun!? Are you okay? That was a loud noise.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice got closer, so she must have come to my side.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It hurts so much it feels like I’m dying…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, that’s not good. Should we go to the hospital?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just let me rest for a while, it should be fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is there anything you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can I have a cushion?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It hurts, and I don’t feel like moving for a while. I think I need to lie on the floor for a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be nice if I could borrow a cushion nearby as a makeshift pillow.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright. Here, raise your head. Okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I do as I’m told, lifting my neck and relaxing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This cushion feels weird. It doesn’t feel like fabric, it’s soft and warm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I open my eyes, Tenjō-san’s face is right above me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her tied hair has come undone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How is it? Do you feel sick or anything after hitting your head?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you seriously giving me a lap pillow?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, if it’s uncomfortable, I’ll stop.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Trying not to show her embarrassment, she avoids looking at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s the most comfortable I’ve ever been.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then that’s good.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Because of the rain, everything in the dim room with only the faint light from outside and the sound of rain seems different.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her pale lips and hair seem more lustrous than usual, and her wet, clinging clothes reveal the lines of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The curves of her chest and hips contrast with her slender arms, legs and shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Above all, I’m surprised by the softness of the body that was touching me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Don’t look up, my innerwear might be showing through.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We remain still, feeling each other’s body heat as time passes.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">“The rain is intense, and it’s getting stronger.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re lucky we got back before it turned into a downpour.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your room is next door, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I’m bothering you, I’ll leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll leave the timing to you. At this point, both our rooms feel like one and the same.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Perhaps influenced by the lap pillow, she utters those words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A fierce light rips through the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman’s face is illuminated by the flash of lightning, appearing monochromatic to my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then comes the thunder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The intense sound, as if shattering the world, makes droplets from her wet hair fall on my cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s cold.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I should get a towel before you catch a cold. I was careless. I’ll bring one right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before she can stand up, I impulsively move and grab her wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stiffens and doesn’t move.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s as if time stands still unless I take another action.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the discomfort of my rain-soaked shirt clinging to me, my body feels unusually hot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m acutely aware of the suppressed flames of desire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My heart races as if it’s about to burst.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intense sound of the rain fills the room, drowning out all other noises.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of my movements is surely inaudible in this room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It almost feels like a permission granted by the heavens.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san, with her back turned, takes a deep breath through her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pull the arm of the person I used to only look up to and gently seat her back on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I let go of her hand, but she doesn’t run away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you cold from being wet?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was warm because of your body heat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That sounds somewhat lewd.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think one is free to interpret it as they like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it because I did something unnecessary?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“For me, it was the best pillow of my life. I wanted to keep sleeping like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then my legs would go numb.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why did you give me a lap pillow then?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I ask, curious.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“On the contrary, what do you want from me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her question was more straightforward than ever before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I want to get closer to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that love? Or lust?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Both. I’m not so clever or simple enough to act on just one.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Love and lust are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Neither is more noble or dirty than the other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think humans live in a mix of unconditional love and unavoidable physiological desires.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed to me that this encapsulates the complexity of human nature.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sure you and I are just being swept away by the mood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am not.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was certain about that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, are you interested in me just because I’m a convenient woman who’s close by?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it were for such a cheap reason, I would have already taken you to my bed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She shivered at my words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah… I’m sorry. I mean, I cherish you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;I’m not as great a woman as you expect.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She whispered, her face downcast.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sensed an unpleasant turn in the conversation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">The woman in front of me suddenly spoke bluntly, as if she had become a different person.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It would be so easy to just go with the flow and accept you as a man. To be honest and not think about the consequences can be satisfying…but would that really make you and me happier?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While she seemed to understand, she laid out her logic, and it felt like her heart, which had seemed so close just moments ago, was drifting away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was wrong to lead you on. The time we spent together was truly enjoyable, and your cooking made me happy. But it’s not good for us to have a deeper relationship.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to become a bitter memory for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before I could interject, she rapidly expressed her feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s doomed to fail…is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The students will graduate. Once this student-teacher relationship ends, this closeness will inevitably change.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to change it for the better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Thank you for being brave. It made me realize my own irresponsibility.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As she stands up, a fierce flash of lightning illuminates the room in white.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her shadow looms in black as she turns her back to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The pain has subsided, right? Then, you should go back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She points to the door without looking at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t act like you’re the only one to blame and resolve this on your own. This is a problem for both of us.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stand up as well.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just be obedient and follow along.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You said it yourself, Tenjō-san. ‘I don’t want to become a bitter memory for you.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So what?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She tilts her head wearily, looking annoyed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s ridiculous. Who decided our relationship has to end badly?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The future is unknown to anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed to me that she was avoiding moving forward because she didn’t want the current relationship to end.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;This relationship has been wrong from the start!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She gets agitated but still doesn’t look at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What I want to know isn’t some ‘plausible’ adult excuse. I want to know your true feelings.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō could have taken advantage of me with a mature attitude or coldly pushed me away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, she’s indecisive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Encouraging me to leave, yet unable to clearly reject me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she still won’t face me, I try to take her hand one more time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Stop it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Pushing away her hand forcefully, she accidentally hits my cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I’m sorry…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She apologizes immediately and finally looks up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She doesn’t seem angry or disgusted, but rather, she looks concerned about me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you’re really bad at acting.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I move slightly closer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She pulls back as if to escape, seemingly forgetting that the bed is behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Caught off guard, she falls back onto the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…No way.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She’s taken aback by how easily she ended up on the bed due to my slight movement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To prevent her from escaping, I too, climb onto the bed, covering her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The single bed creaks under the weight of both of us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This is not my intention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But just like when we met over shared food, she tried to avoid crucial conversations by running away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I back down now, I’m not sure I’ll have the courage to initiate this conversation again.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re going to keep evading me, I don’t know what I would do…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to keep my tone as joking and frivolous as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hoped that if I turned this into our usual meaningless banter, it would be easier for her to talk.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t get on my bed without permission.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She regains her assertiveness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You were sleeping on my bed too, weren’t you, Tenjō-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-that was an accident!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then this is also an accident.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I boldly retort, she glares at me with a sulky expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, she soon complains in a faint voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve never been pushed down by a man before…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was pretty easy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, is that some kind of special technique that you have?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her attempt to bluff with all her might was cute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I had such techniques, I would have used them to kiss Tenjō-san first.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She hastily covers her lips with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but laugh. No man could remain unmoved by such an innocent reaction from a beautiful older woman like her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I only wanted to kiss you, I would have done it quietly while you were asleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so?.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Tenjō-san, you’re too defenseless.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know how you can stand it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I couldn’t, and that’s why I got slapped earlier.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I admit my own folly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That was an accident… Did it hurt?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even now, she can’t hide her sweetness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She reaches out to my cheek with concern. Her cold hand feels pleasant on my heated cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you like pain? Are you a masochist or something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Being intensely led by an older Onee-san isn’t too bad.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t casually express your own desires! …it puts pressure on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, what does that mean!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t look so blatantly happy, you idiot!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With the hand gently touching my cheek, she tries to push my face away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Because it makes me start to have expectations.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Under me, she stiffens, her gaze darting back and forth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wait for her next words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I even once accept my own desires and feelings, I think I won’t be able to hold back anymore. I’d want more and more things and wouldn’t be able to stop. But I can’t imagine this relationship working out any better than it is now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why do you assume it won’t work?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Because I don’t believe in eternal love.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I am slightly lost for words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s hard to believe such a beautiful person would express such self-doubt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You must have been put off, right, hearing a woman over twenty saying this? Right? You’re put off, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s so girly and cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Ah, shut up! Don’t just accept it! Do you have a Pacific ocean-wide heart?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you saying, you who are like the sun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s what I’m talking about! The real me isn’t as beautiful or admirable as you think I am! And being older and a Sensei, even if it’s okay now, there will definitely come a day when you’re disillusioned with me! I’m afraid and hate that ending! That’s why I can’t move forward!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked as if she was about to cry, like a child throwing a tantrum.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please…just go home for today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This time, I had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Yuunagi Nishiki wasn’t a student but in a different position, would you have accepted me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I were older than Reiyu Tenjō, could this relationship have progressed further?</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I had been a man she could rely on without fear or hesitation, would she not have any struggle?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, the problem is surely not just that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">If the feelings growing between us are love, then merely taking a step forward as we are now is not enough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unless I can erase her distrust in ‘love’ that she herself harbors, we’re likely to end up with a sad conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She knows this too, which is why she’s hesitant to rush into what lies ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She prefers the ambiguous yet comfortable present over a future where she might get hurt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Right now, even if I make the person I like to cry, I can’t stop her tears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was frustrated with myself for that.</p>
