<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving in Lunot, Reito stopped the carriage in front of the Adventurers’ Guild, to entrust Shuu and Gaida to the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a small commotion in the guild, as an F rank adventurer had returned with a carriage and two pro empire faction members in tow, but the receptionist took care of the necessary procedures quickly and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was told to wait in the guest room, as Bal would meet him.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guildmaster entered the room and addressed him with a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly&#8230;you’re always bringing me trouble, aren’t you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha&#8230;I’m sorry?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, this time you pulled off quite the feat, though. Catching pro empire faction members is really impressive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal gave a small bag to Reito. Shuu and Gaida were wanted criminals, so their capture would be rewarded.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-56996472' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-56996472' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took the bag and Bal continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those two are bottom tier lackeys in the faction, but they were definitely behind the recent armed Goblins’ attacks. The royal army will owe us one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is my rank going to increase?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t waste time, do you&#8230;here, your new card.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal took out a guild card and gave it to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, Reito’s name and the words “Rank E” were engraved. Thanks to his feat, Reito was promoted to rank E without having to take the exam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh&#8230;thank you very much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a special exception, though. Normally, beginners can’t be promoted in the first two months after their registration. You’ll have to take the exam next time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Understood. By the way, about the Ymir coal mines&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You found some Goblin corpses and a dead Demon there, by chance, right? We’ve sent a search team. Why in the world would you go to a place like that, though? Did you hope to find Mithril?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha, yes, something like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had reported to the guild about the Ymir coal mine too, just in case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bal, the search would take time, so the pro empire faction might have erased any evidence from there already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had collected the gear used by the Goblins, so he submitted it to the guild. He remembered Basil’s features, so he drew a portrait and showed it to Bal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to have seen that face before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Basil&#8230;a Monster Tamer, but they called him Basil the Beast Trainer. If you ask me, he’s more of a beast himself than the monsters he used&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was he a wanted criminal?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yup, and he had a hefty bounty on his head too, 10 gold coins. I heard he was caught some years ago and shipped over to the Prison City, though&#8230;I’ll have to check about that later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ten gold coins&#8230;maybe I messed up this time&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? Did you say something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not report the whole truth about the events in the Ymir coal mine: he simply said he happened to find Basil’s corpse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis had insisted on that point, urging Reito to keep the truth to himself. It was dangerous to get too involved, so Reito acted as if he had nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going to happen now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who can say&#8230;the kingdom is going to handle the rest. Those two will probably get the death sentence, but they earned it. If they have valuable information, they might just end up in prison, though&#8230;it’s unthinkable that they planned the Goblin attacks just by themselves, so the royal army will likely increase their patrols.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;by the way, there is something I’d like to ask&#8230;do you know of a man called Gain?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Reito uttered the words, Bal’s expression twisted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;what did you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her change was so stark Reito was shocked. Bal grabbed his arm and started questioning him.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-65897614' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-65897614' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where have you heard that name? Do you know something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I&#8230;I just heard that from one of the Tamers&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so&#8230;which means, he was involved in these events too&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal reached for the cup on her desk and clenched it so hard it almost cracked. She then downed the contents in one gulp, seeming to calm her nerves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she resumed speaking, her tone was tinged in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t something E rank adventurers should get involved in. Leave the rest to us and go back to your regular adventuring business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal said nothing else and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, mystified by her change in attitude, contacted Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, I should have warned you in advance, never to mention Gain’s name to Bal&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Why is that?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They are acquainted with each other, actually. Their relationship was not good by any means, however: it is marked by a series of murders.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Murders…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Twenty years ago, Gain killed Bal’s parents. They met again after she became an adventurer: at that time, Gain lost one eye at her hands, but killed her adventurer companions at the time.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had thus inadvertently touched on Bar’s thirst for revenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I shouldn’t have said that, right…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I believe that’s an understatement. Bal is going to die at this rate.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was shocked by the unexpected prediction.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis explained that Reito’s words caused a dramatic change in Bal’s fate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Bal will leave the Adventurers’ Guild to act on her own. She will eventually discover Gain’s whereabouts and attempt to kill him, but she will fall into a trap and be killed instead.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That can’t be&#8230;all because of me!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well&#8230;if you didn’t ask about Gain, she would not have done something so reckless, that is true. Gain will not survive unscathed, however: he will die too, due to the wounds inflicted by Bal.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Can it be stopped?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It would be quite difficult. If you do not do anything, they will definitely die, but if you get involved without the proper preparations another serious problem will arise.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Which is?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I do not have the ability to see your future. As I said before, I can see everything related to the creatures born in this world. Since your soul came from another world, however, I cannot see anything related to you. Moreover, it is also difficult to see the future of those involved with you.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized that Airis was not in favor of rescuing Bal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『If you do not get involved any further, Bal and Gain will both die. If you do, however, I will not be able to predict the outcome. It might be possible to save Bal, but it might also mean that Gain will survive too. There is also the possibility that both will die, but you will too, Reito.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『In other words, you won’t be able to give me advice as you have until now.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I can tell you the whereabouts of Bal and Gain, as well as their abilities. But I cannot see their future when you’re involved. Thus personally, I am not in favor of getting involved with this&#8230;what will you do?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Save her.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Of course&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Sorry.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis sighed, as she knew what Reito was going to say from the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito apologized for causing her trouble with his decision, then they started talking about his plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『If I get involved any further, Bal’s future will change&#8230;which means, now that I’m not involved yet, can you see what’s going to happen to her?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is correct. Before you take any meaningful actions, I can see her future. She will find Gain’s hideout five days from now and go on the attack by herself. She will defeat Gain’s subordinates, but will be struck by a poisoned arrow before fighting Gain, partially paralyzing her body. She will exert the last of her strength to deliver a fatal blow to Gain, but she will eventually die from the poison.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So the direct cause of her death is poison?』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-71096061' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-71096061' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc0JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8aW5zIGNsYXNzPSJhZHNieWdvb2dsZSIKICAgICBzdHlsZT0iZGlzcGxheTpibG9jazsgdGV4dC1hbGlnbjpjZW50ZXI7IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtbGF5b3V0PSJpbi1hcnRpY2xlIgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtZm9ybWF0PSJmbHVpZCIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWNsaWVudD0iY2EtcHViLTY2MDk0NDIzMzgwODAxMTYiCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1zbG90PSI1NTg2ODE4NjUwIj48L2lucz4KPHNjcmlwdD4KICAgICAoYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgPSB3aW5kb3cuYWRzYnlnb29nbGUgfHwgW10pLnB1c2goe30pOwo8L3NjcmlwdD4=' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Exactly. Gain himself is an accomplished swordsman too, though. His skills are equal to an A rank adventurer.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see, if I fought him directly, I’d be at a disadvantage.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing about the enemy’s skills with the sword reminded Reito of his weakness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His current skills were far inferior to Bal’s, but naturally he could not compete with Gain either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis’ predictions, if Reito were to fight against Gain now, his chances of victory would be zero. If he didn’t do something within five days, however, Bal would be killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to save her life, it was necessary either to convince her not to track Gain, or to make sure they did not meet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her resolve was already firm, however. Reito knew that to convince her not to go, or lead her to another objective would be next to impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『How far is Gain’s hideout from here?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『If Ullr pulls the carriage, it will take about half a day. In other words, you have about four days of leeway before the fateful day.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『To improve my sword skills enough to match an accomplished swordsman in four days&#8230;is impossible, isn’t it?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It is. No matter how you train, there is no way to match Gain in four days. You should then use a different strategy.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A different strategy&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Fortunately enough, Gain possesses only the Swordsman and Martial Artist jobs. In other words, he cannot use magic. You therefore have the advantage in this case: if you can create a situation in which magic is an advantage over other forms of fighting&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You mean fight with magic?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Not exactly. I mean to use magic as a means of battle. Simply speaking, to blend magic and sword in your fighting style.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the current Reito, matching Gain with his sword was simply unthinkable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he could use abilities that Gain couldn’t, however, he might have a chance. Reito found a glimmer of hope in the possibilities suggested by Airis.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito left the Adventurers’ Guild and got on his carriage. He could not leave the carriage at the inn, so he decided to leave the city for the time being. His destination was the first human settlement he visited after leaving the Abyssal Forest &#8211; the village of Faas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village had been attacked by armed Goblins, but most of the buildings were still intact: there were lodgings available too. No one would be inconvenienced even if Reito left his horse carriage here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then&#8230;let’s start practicing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can take a nap, buddy. I don’t have anything for you to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did some light stretching, then opened his status window to check the magic he had learned until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could use the Support Magician job’s “Support Magic” and “Basic Grade Magic”, which anyone could use. He could not use the powerful “Blast Magic”, commonly available to Magician job holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also impossible to learn Blast Magic by using SP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could use his SP to raise the proficiency level of Basic Grade Magic to the maximum. He could also learn new Basic Grade Magic spells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think it’s worth it to use SP to learn new Basic Grade spells, though&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided to review the magic spells he knew and tried combining them in the so-called Compound Magic Spells.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-99044632' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-99044632' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In battle Reito often used Iceclad Sword and Ice Blade Bullet, both variations of Ice Block, but in terms of offensive magic, the fire element was more powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ice Block could be used to cut down the opponent, but fire magic could cause more dramatic effects, such as explosions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then&#8230;let’s start with Fire Blade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito focused on his palm, activating Magic Power Boost followed by Fire Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Magic Power Boost, the offensive power of the spell increased: the flame rising from his palm was larger than normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large, crescent-shaped blade formed on Reito’s palm, then crashed against the house in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deserted house was engulfed in flames after the impact and turned to cinders in seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s Flame Bullet could not be controlled precisely, so it caused indiscriminate destruction to the whole target area, but Flame Blade could be used to hit a single target with high firepower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pretty good&#8230;and easier to use than Flame Bullet too&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thoroughly checking his new Craft Skill, Reito tried another combination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next test involved Ice Block and Earth Block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s try using Iceclad Sword with Gravity Blade&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created an Ice Block longsword on his right palm, then made it surge with crimson magic power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravity Blade was used to wield weighty swords like Reito’s Cleansing Blade more easily: by using it on the light Iceclad Sword, he hoped to be able to increase the speed of his attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s Iceclad Sword, however, could not withstand the gravity shift and shattered to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!? Crap&#8230;no good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iceclad Sword was not hard enough to endure the gravity created by Reito’s palm. He realized that only a sword with high resistance to magic could endure Gravity Blade’s effects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought about what to try next and came up with the idea of boosting the magic spell itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Normal Magicians use Magic Stones to make their magic stronger, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magicians usually used the Magic Stones embedded on their wands to boost the effects of magic spells. Reito wondered if he could do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called Airis to know more about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『H-hey&#8230;please, I’m changing right now.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ah, sorry&#8230;no, wait.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Of course I do. It gets really hot in summer, I can’t stand it if I don’t take showers regularly.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So the seasons change in your world too&#8230;anyway, did you watch my training?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, yes&#8230;using Magic Stones to reinforce your magic, was it? In that case, I would recommend using the magic tool called Magic Ring. You can wear it on your arm to boost your magic, without having to use a staff or wand.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Magic Ring, huh&#8230;where can I buy one?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, there’s just the right place to get one, without having to go back to the city. I happen to know where you can find a Magic Ring no one is using currently.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay&#8230;I have a bad feeling about this&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was deeply concerned by Airis’ words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew that a magic-boosting accessory was going to be useful, however, so he decided to take her suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito left the carriage in the Faas village and rode away on Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their destination was a place filled with memories, in their nostalgic Abyssal Forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So&#8230;what did we come here for?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It can’t be helped, you know. You couldn’t have retrieved it when you lived in the forest, so I didn’t say anything at the time.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Ring was apparently somewhere in the forest. Reito proceeded with confidence: he remembered the lay of the land well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a sigh, Reito talked to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why did the Magic Ring have to be with one of the dead people in our cave, of all places&#8230;I have the feeling that I’m always taking stuff from corpses recently&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr replied to Reito’s complaints with a sharp bark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;they took care of you before, so of course you’d want a memento&#8230;”</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr had been raised by a female Elf before meeting Reito: he had become able to understand human languages during that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s parents were killed when he was very young: he survived by himself for a while, but was then picked up by an Elf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito also used the cave she lived in as his dwelling: she was already dead when he arrived, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, she had been killed by a vicious creature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The body was nowhere to be found, but the Magic Ring was apparently still there: in the lair of the creature that killed the female Elf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Who killed her?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A Minotauros. This type of monster does not dwell in forests normally&#8230;but this one started living in the forest, due to certain reasons, and now acts as the forest’s boss. By the way, this Minotauros is also responsible for the death of Ullr’s parents.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That female Elf challenged the Minotauros by herself, to avenge their death, but was not strong enough.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito advanced through the forest, while rubbing Ullr’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotauros they were looking for turned out to have quite the connection with Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were now heading towards the southern side of the forest: an area Airis warned them to stay away from, when they still lived in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr carefully proceeded in that unknown area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, they arrived before a river flowing through the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re here&#8230;stay alert, Ullr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, their destination was just beyond the small river. Reito and Ullr used Leap to cross it, then proceeded upstream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was carefully observing the surroundings as they went and felt something was off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Weird&#8230;there aren’t any monsters around here&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abyssal Forest was a veritable den of monsters.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-77359716' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-77359716' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bear-type monsters, like the Blood Bears, often went to the rivers for fishing. For some reason, however, Reito and Ullr had not encountered a single monster yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to proceed while preserving their energies was a good thing, naturally, but the unusual lack of monsters was a cause of concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito clenched the hilt of the broadsword on his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why isn’t there even one…? Did your nose pick up anything?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr shook his head. Not even his nose could pick up any smell of monsters: the surroundings had to be really deserted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito eventually decided to take the question to Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airish!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Again with the lisp? In a serious scene like this? How does it happen, when you’re not even actually talking…? Could it be that you have awakened the “Clumsy Ditz” personality trait…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh shut up&#8230;what’s going on here, anyway?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Isn’t it nice, there aren’t any monsters in that area&#8230;it’s the boss’ territory, after all.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The boss’ territory&#8230;I see.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monsters, as well as normal animals, closely guarded their territory: they would attack any intruders without mercy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr had already stepped in the Minotauros’ territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What monsters are there usually in this area?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『There aren’t any Goblins or Kobolds, but Orcs, Blood Bears and the rare Ogre. But even they stay away from this territory, so&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They’re all afraid of the boss&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could not perceive any monster presence because they all stayed out of the Minotauros’ territory, fearing it. The forest boss was powerful enough to intimidate even Ogres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a pinch of apprehension for the coming battle against the Minotauros, Reito prayed he wouldn’t end up dead before the fight with Gain.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So this is the place&#8230;it’s huge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrowl&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Easy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr arrived in front of a massive waterfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They carefully studied the surroundings: according to Airis, the Minotauros’ lair was located here. There was a cave behind the waterfall, similar to the place Reito and Ullr used as their dwelling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cave was not a natural one, however: the Minotauros had dug the cave into the cliff and used it as a lair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotauros was far more powerful than the Blood Bear: the one that moved to this area actually exterminated a pack of Blood Bears by itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the five-step danger scale for monsters, it was ranked four: normally, a party of rank A adventurers would be needed to take one down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why Reito went to face such a dangerous opponent was to retrieve the memento of Ullr’s previous caretaker and because he trusted Airis’ advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to lure the Minotauros out of the cave where it was supposedly hiding, Reito made his resolve and lightly slapped Ullr’s back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WOOOOFFF!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s howl echoed in the surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito watched from above, standing on top of the waterfall. The moment he drew his broadsword, a gigantic figure jumped out of the waterfall, spraying water everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a creature with a human-like body and the head of a black bull — the Minotauros. It looked at Reito and Ullr, snorting menacingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bfooooh…!!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-52078444' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-52078444' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotauros was about two meters tall, roughly the same size as an Orc, but the intimidating aura it emanated was completely different. Its body was bulging with muscles, like an Ogre; it was covered in black fur, but its limbs looked completely human: the only bull-like feature was its head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, the Minotauros was not a monster, but a member of the Demon species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its intellect was superior to normal Goblins: it stripped weapons and armor from its beaten opponents and wore them itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotauros facing Reito and Ullr actually had a silver armband hanging from one of its horns. It was armed with an axe made for Giants and had a Mithril chain wrapped around its arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled Airis’ words of warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Be very careful. This Minotauros was previously used as a “war slave”, a slave forced to fight for its masters. The chain on its arm was used to restrain it, but now it uses it as a weapon. The axe is a special magic tool, so do not think you can destroy it physically.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, facing the clearly fearsome opponent, gripped his broadsword tighter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrooowl…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bfoooooh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotauros looked down at Reito, ready to swing his broadsword, and the growling Ullr. After a closer look at the latter, however, it stopped moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito found it unusual and observed the creature’s movements: the Minotauros slowly reached for its head — for the silver bracelet on its horn. It took it off and flung it on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bfooh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof…!?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minotaurus’ inexplicable behavior left Reito and Ullr puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like that, the bull Demon turned around and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stood speechless for a few moments, but Ullr turned towards the Magic Ring and sniffed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr took the Magic Ring in his mouth, then looked at the Minotauros’ back. In his eyes brimmed both anger and sadness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, still confused by the Minotauros’ actions,wrapped his arms around Ullr and held him tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While looking at the Minotauros walk away, Reito called Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Phew&#8230;you were lucky, you two. That Minotauros remembered Ullr, apparently.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What exactly happened?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The Minotauros let you go, as you can see. It still remembers the Elf it fought against four years ago.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis explained that Minotauros were extremely belligerent, but also had a sort of warrior’s pride: they took the gear and items from the opponents they defeated as a gesture of respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Minotauros’ high intellect, it still remembered Mille, the female Elf it fought against four years prior. She was defeated, but the Minotauros took the Magic Ring from her as a sign of respect for her strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minotauros do not lay their hands on the weak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They only fight against opponents they deem strong enough. In fact, when it fought and killed Ullr’s parents it did not do anything to the weak newborn Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time too, the Minotauros did not fight because it did not see them as worthy opponents. If they were strong enough to pose a threat, the Minotauros would have attacked without a second thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Reito successfully retrieved the memento of Ullr’s caretaker, but felt defeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr watched the Minotauros go, resenting their own weakness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito called the frustrated Ullr and left, before the Minotauros changed its mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr turned around and looked back several times, but ultimately could only follow Reito. He clenched the Magic Ring in his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their primary objective cleared, Reito and Ullr returned to their old cave dwelling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why they did not immediately leave the forest was to check the Magic Ring’s powers: the forest was a suitable place for training. In order to see how the Magic Ring could be used in battle, Reito decided to spend the night in the cave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yaawn&#8230;it’s been a while since I last woke up here&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa! So that’s the sound you make when you yawn…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito got up from the makeshift bed, with Ullr as a pillow. Usually, Ullr got up first and woke him up, but this time they woke up at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Ring retrieved from the Minotauros was on Reito’s left arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at the accessory and counted eight slots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Ring was a tool used to reinforce the user’s magic: its true powers manifested only when Magic Stones were set in the slots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, Reito put the Barrier Stone he found in the abandoned village in the slot. He had a Decay Stone too, but using it would have caused Ullr discomfort, so he didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『How do you use the Barrier Stone&#8230;? Airis?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You need to place a finger on the writing engraved on the stone and chant a spell. In that Barrier Stone’s case, the chant is “Shield”.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shield”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito uttered the chant, as per Airis’ instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A green barrier formed from the Magic Ring, creating a 50 cm wide round shield. Reito tried touching it and his finger was repelled by the rubber-like shield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, pretty cool…! But it works only if I put a finger on the stone…? It’ll be hard to use it in battle&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*lap lap lap*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, no licking!! This isn’t candy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr started licking the green shield, so Reito hurriedly stopped him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Magic Tool was a bit tricky to use, but it could repel physical attacks, so if Reito figured out how to use it effectively, it could be very useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then recalled his initial objective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three more days&#8230;if I don’t get stronger quickly, Bal will die&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know, I’m not whining.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito only knew Bal for a couple weeks, but she had been of great help to him. He couldn’t just let her die like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also the reason why she was doomed to meet her death, so Reito felt guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to master that sword skill, first of all.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated a Support Magic spell and the stone on his new Magic Ring glowed, as a white light surged from his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito confirmed the new effect and swung his broadsword, not without some hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Strike Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he poured the strength of all of his muscles in the slash, the broadsword created a powerful wind pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both offensive power and speed were much higher than before. The swing was also much wider than before, however, creating a larger opening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;Strike Blade is strong, but it’ll take a while before I get used to it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A fast opponent like Ullr could easily dodge it too. The same weakness as Spin Strike&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito rubbed Ullr’s head, deep in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin Strike was a Battle Art that involved slashing the enemy while spinning, as the name said. If the rotation was stopped before hitting the enemy there would be no point in using it; every rotation raised speed and power, but blocking or avoiding attacks became impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Strike Blade is fast from the start, since I just concentrate on a single slash, but it’s weaker than Spin Strike&#8230;wait&#8230;from the start…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An idea suddenly flashed in Reito’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The toll on his body would be great, but by equipping the Magic Ring and using Muscle Boost he might be able to endure it. Reito tried it out immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr, stay back&#8230;I might hit you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just a little test.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr moved to a safe place and Reito readied his broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strike Blade, fast from the beginning, and Spin Strike, faster and stronger with every rotation. Together, these two skills should create a very powerful Battle Art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated Muscle Boost first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here goes&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito performed several horizontal sweeps for practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he felt ready, he performed Strike Blade and Spin Strike at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito swung the broadsword with great momentum, but in the same instant a jolt of pain ran through his body. He couldn’t help but let go of the hilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito fell down on the ground, as the broadsword clattered in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He nodded to the worried Ullr and stood back up, looking at his hurting arms with a frown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ow ow ow&#8230;it didn’t work, huh&#8230;using two Battle Arts at the same time isn’t easy, after all. It doesn’t seem impossible, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m fine, don’t worry. I have to do this much, or I’m never going to win&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s next opponent surpassed him greatly in sword skills, and he knew it well. A fighting style incorporating magic was necessary to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried using Muscle Boost and then activating Gravity Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to reduce the burden as much as I can&#8230;okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He picked up his broadsword and let the crimson magic power fill the blade completely. Thanks to the gravity manipulation, he could swing the broadsword very lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shaah!!!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-78206888' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-78206888' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito swung again, activating the two Battle Arts simultaneously, but once again the pain was too much: the broadsword dropped from his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh&#8230;failed again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m fine, I’ve started figuring it out. I’m not going to stop until I figure it out&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito healed his aching muscles with Recovery Boost, then thought for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He realized that one of the reasons why he let go of the broadsword was his lacking grip strength. He then decided to improve his physical abilities through this training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thus started swinging, again and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here goes&#8230;nothing!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not simply swing the broadsword: he stepped forward with decisive momentum and poured all of his muscles in the swing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, he became able to swing the broadsword faster than ever. His balance also remained stable after the swing, his form cleaner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;Combination Battle Art “Spin Strike Blade” acquired&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I learned something. Hm? Combination?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “new skill acquired” window appeared before Reito’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill category was a new one for him, however: “Combination” Battle Art. It was not a Craft Skill, but a unique category of skills born from the combination of multiple Battle Arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tested the new skill immediately: he could swing his broadsword much faster than before, as the sound of sliced air echoed in the cave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill drained more energy than other Battle Arts: after activating it Reito fell to his knees, panting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was far from mastering it, but it would definitely turn out to be very powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, might as well try it with other Battle Arts too. Let’s see, Helmet Smasher and Strike Blade&#8230;but first, a bit of rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*lap lap lap*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, I’m dirty now — hahaha!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr came closer and started licking Reito’s face, so the boy realized his partner was worried about him. He rubbed Ullr’s head until he calmed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tried combining all the four Battle Arts he knew, learning new skills one after the other.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Reito was training in the Abyssal Forest, the search team formed by the Adventurers’ Guild and the royal army investigated the Ymir coal mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team was formed by two A rank adventurers hand-picked by Bal and ten royal army soldiers assigned to the Adventure City Lunot: their task was to recover the bodies of the armed Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they arrived at the excavation site, however, there were no Goblins to be found. All they could find were traces of fighting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pro empire faction had likely already erased their tracks: the search team then decided to investigate the mines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon entering the mine, the whole search team died at the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of death was the same for all of them: lethal wounds from a bladed weapon. The scene was described with a single word, “carnage”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bodies of the search team members presented countless wounds, their heads cut off and lined up on the ground, surrounded by pools of blood. The message was clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search team had died at the hands of a single one-eyed swordsman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked down at his katana which was drenched in blood while he sat on one of the corpses of a search team member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His gaze moved from the eerily glowing blade to the corpses he had just cut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The swordsman’s thoughts were absorbed in contemplating the mutilated bodies, a look of ecstasy on his face.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He licked the blood dripping from the blade, as if reluctant to waste it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prominent canines poked out of his mouth as he smiled. His eyes were of an unusual red color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boyish-looking man was clearly excited at the sight of the dead bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was the man Bal swore revenge on, her fated enemy for the last twenty years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not a human being, but a Vampire — a Demon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vampires had the ability to turn other species into Vampires: Gain too used to be a normal human, but was turned into a Vampire dozens of years before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The greatest trait of Vampires was their ability to stop aging, as long as they drank blood. In fact, Gain’s appearance had not changed since he was 15 years old. Incidentally, Vampires favored Human blood the most: being undead creatures, they could not produce blood by themselves, so they made others’ blood into their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain looked at the dead female body under him and shed sincere tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You humans are not our prey&#8230;we should live side by side, in harmony. How unfortunate, that you had to refuse to become my slave&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gain encountered the search team, he asked them to surrender. He was refused, however, so he had no choice but to kill them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How sad…! Humans and us, we should be able to understand each other, and yet…! Don’t you agree?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;scum.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain turned around and asked the question to the other officer of the pro empire faction he had come to the Ymir mine with. His gaze, however, only found a large boulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person Gain had turned to was hiding behind the boulder: the other officer was an Assassin job holder who rarely showed themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain continued his self-absorbed monologue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You cannot comprehend my words yet? Humans are not cattle for us Vampires, we should be able to coexist&#8230;thus I had a duty to respect their will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no interest in your way of thinking&#8230;I will go make my report now. What will you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, yes&#8230;it appears my presence was noticed by someone in a city close to here, so I am going to welcome them into my family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your slaves, you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;what did you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The officer’s mocking words caused Gain to frown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sheathed his blood-red sword, then stepped towards the boulder and drew it again, emanating an incredible amount of killing intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; ‘</span><b>Unsheathed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A red slash cleaved the boulder in two. The katana had sliced the boulder like a knife through butter, but the presence behind it was already gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;you already ran?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boulder fell apart and Gain frowned at the empty space behind it. He sheathed his sword once again, then touched the scar on his left eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vampire’s scar was caused by a former S rank adventurer, the current guildmaster of the Black Tigers guild, Bal. Gain grinned as his fingers traced the old wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Vampire, he could use the blood he sucked to boost his strength or heal his wounds. He chose to leave the scar on his left eye, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He desired to meet Bal, the woman who hated him and was now desperately searching for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scar stood as a symbol of his desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain had killed her parents and, two years before, the person she loved the most too had fallen at his hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come, come soon, my beloved&#8230;there is nothing more delectable than the blood of those who seek revenge&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain longed for the meeting with his “favorite food”, which he crafted for almost twenty years.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr, back in Faas village, were resting in the horse carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could finally sleep in a warm blanket after days of camping, so he felt completely rejuvenated: when he woke up, it was already past noon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fwaah&#8230;sleepy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, yeah, I’ll start cooking&#8230;we’re having boar meat tonight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr jumped at Reito as soon as he got out of the blanket. Reito patted his head, then took out ingredients and cooking utensils from his Storage subspace and started cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Fireball, he could start a fire even without wood. He used the seasonings he recently bought at the market, put meat and vegetables in the pot, and started cooking the stew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm..delish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiiine….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, Ullr. You know you have to wait for it to cool a bit before you can eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr looked at Reito with pleading eyes, but he couldn’t eat food when it was still hot, so Reito instructed him to wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Reito finished his meal and checked the state of his tools. He then searched the nearby houses for any useful items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a while since the Goblin attack&#8230;there isn’t much to left here anymore.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the day when Reito first visited the village, now there were clear signs that outsiders, probably thieves, had gone through any valuables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were little to no daily necessities: only shattered plates or broken chairs remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to his Alchemist skills, Reito could repair and put to use many of the items, so he collected a fair volume of tools from the empty houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his first visit, he was interrupted by the arrival of Nao and her knights, so he couldn’t search the village thoroughly, but this time he found useful tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, this is the last one&#8230;now I can only hope that the plan goes well&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong, Ullr? Hm…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito left the house and Ullr ran up to him. He whined sadly, rubbing his face against Reito’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked in the direction Ullr came from and found a large man, wolfing down the contents of Reito’s stew pot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nghah…! So good!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!? Who are you!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately drew his broadsword, but the man seemed not to notice: he lifted the pot and poured the remaining stew in his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was much larger than Reito: there was no doubt that he was a Giant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Giant emptied the pot and set it down, satisfied. His face smeared in stew, he rubbed his belly pleasantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was really good&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito instinctively thanked the large man, who reacted with utter surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;!! Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s bark was a loud and clear “that’s our line!!”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man looked at Reito and Ullr, then at the empty pot, then at them again. He nodded to himself, then prostrated on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very sorry!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf….?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-89366041' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-89366041' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr were taken aback by the Giant’s behavior. His face pressed against the ground, the man continued to apologize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr looked at each other and decided to listen to his story first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Giant’s name was Gonzo. He too was an adventurer: he had taken the extermination request of certain crustacean-type monsters near the village of Faas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzo successfully disposed of the monsters, but he suffered a grave wound in the battle and lost all of his food and water supplies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He somehow managed to go back to Faas on foot, but he almost collapsed from hunger. At that exact time, the smell of stew tickled his nostrils&#8230;before he realized it, he was already stuffing his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzo said he would pay for the food, so Reito activated his Storage magic and gave him a great quantity of dried meat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m really sorry&#8230;to both of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzo apologized to Ullr too for eating their food without permission, but Ullr barked at him not to worry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the food from Reito, Gonzo took out a leather satchel filled with bronze coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry, this is all I have at the moment. If I go back to the guild, I can receive the reward for the request, but&#8230;right, want to go together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I have other things to do&#8230;besides we will move with our carriage, don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it&#8230;I’m a D rank adventurer in the Fang Dragon guild, by the way. If I can help you in any way, come visit anytime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fang Dragon&#8230;okay, I’ll remember that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito shook hands with Gonzo and they talked a bit more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, you have made a Giant friend?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yeah&#8230;despite his looks, he’s younger than me, actually.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『For real?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had opened communication with Airis. She was supposed to know everything about this world, so he found it strange that she seemed not to know Gonzo’s age. He boarded the horse carriage and headed for the Ymir coal mine: thanks to Ullr’s speed, they would arrive before sunset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ymir coal mine was the current location of the pro-empire faction officer Gain. According to Airis, he chose to wait there for Bal to find him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『He apparently knows of Bal’s movements too. This is the best chance: his subordinates won’t arrive at the mine until tomorrow morning. Until then, he will be alone.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;can I really win against him, though?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You can always give up on the whole plan.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Not a chance.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I knew you’d say that&#8230;anyway, you have memorized the method I told you about, yes?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Of course.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis had already given Reito information about Gain: he knew about Gain’s sword skills and his relationship with Bal in detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain had acquired the Unsheathe Battle Art, something few swordsmen ever attained. He had brutally slaughtered hundreds of people with that skill alone. He also had the habit of slicing his victims to shreds as much as possible before killing them, relishing in the pain he inflicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『And he’s a Vampire to boot&#8230;should I get some garlic or a cross for protection?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The vampires in your world seem to be weak against such things, but unfortunately the Vampires here are unaffected.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『W-wait a second&#8230;do vampires really exist in my former world?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Indeed they do. They don’t attack people, as you seem to be worried about, though. They operate hospitals and obtain blood from humans under the guise of blood donations.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Whoa&#8230;so that doctor who took a sample of my blood in elementary, even if I cried and complained, was a vampire too&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I wonder&#8230;that world is not under my jurisdiction, so I don’t know such detailed information&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with Airis and reviewed the strategy for the battle against Gain. He was also going to use the skill he practiced so much in the Abyssal Forest in a battle for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;we have to do this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito steeled his resolve. At the same time, Ullr stopped running: they had finally arrived at the Ymir coal mine. They were going to proceed on foot from that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito equipped the Magic Ring and Cleansing Blade, then started climbing the mountain path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;it’s really dark.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not their first visit to the Ymir mine, but they felt a different kind of nervousness this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr perceived the eerie atmosphere and seemed unusually intimidated, as he followed behind Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr&#8230;you can stay here, buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked back angrily and whacked Reito’s back with his front paws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smiling wryly at his partner’s reaction, Reito gripped his broadsword tighter. He activated the Assassin skills Soundless Walk, Stealth, Detect Presence and Seal Presence before proceeding further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;crap, I want to go home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they arrived on the mountain’s summit, Reito and Ullr felt the killing intent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smell of blood already filled the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the mountaintop excavation site, corpses were strewn everywhere, all sliced to ribbons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only their heads were perfectly preserved, all in a line. Among the human heads, there were Goblin-like heads as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near the entrance to the mine, a body — probably Basil’s — was hung on a cross. It was the only corpse whose head had not been cut off, but there were slash wounds all over the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put a hand over his mouth and looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard about it already, but&#8230;it’s too horrible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrrr&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant Reito tried to contact Airis, in order to know the exact whereabouts of the person responsible for the carnage — someone whispered behind his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;..!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito turned around immediately after he heard the whisper, but there was no one to be seen. The voice was then heard from atop a nearby boulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who would you two be…? Surely you are not just passing by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;hello.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked in the direction of the voice and found a young boy with delicate, handsome features and physique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked like a pretty boy, but the aura he emanated was more oppressing than an Ogre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation was evidently dangerous: the battle could start at any moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you’re Gain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh&#8230;if you know who I am, there really is no chance you are just a passing adventurer&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrowl&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A White Wolf&#8230;how filthy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain had an expectant look on his face when he spoke to Reito, but it became a frown when he turned towards Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain was positively interested towards humans, but with other living beings it was the complete opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached for his sword, but —&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not so fast! Flame Bullet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized Gain was going to attack Ullr, so he shot a globe of fire like a cannonball. Gain, however, dodged it with little effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s Flame Bullet was a combination of Fireball, Wind Pressure and Magic Power Boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fireball blew past Gain and crashed against the boulder behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact was so strong Gain went wide-eyed for a moment, then started clapping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Impressive…! I have never seen this spell before! You’re something, boy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why thank you! Flame Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito judged that he couldn’t target Gain precisely with Flame Bullet, so he activated Flame Blade, which had a wider target range, and shot the flaming crescent blade at Gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain, however, activated Leap, lightly hopping from boulder to boulder, moving all around Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m right here~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn you&#8230;don’t look down on me!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain continued jumping around, toying with Reito and Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if they tried changing to a more favorable location, Gain jumped ahead of them, so they couldn’t move at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could use Leap too, but Gain was much faster: he moved almost instantly, appearing behind Reito in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are a Magician, yes? You should know that you cannot compete with me, then. You’re not fast enough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr deliberately voiced their irritation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They continued chasing after Gain, eventually stopping as they were standing back to back. It was their first battle against an opponent that surpassed them in speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shit&#8230;how about this, then!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;what are you trying to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito pressed his palm at the ground and the boulder Gain used as a foothold started changing abnormally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ripple-like vibration expanded with Reito at the center. The boulder crumbled and Gain quickly jumped down on the ground: just as he did, Reito released his palm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earth Block&#8230;basic grade magic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basic grade…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used Earth Block to manipulate the terrain and cause a small-scale quake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, all the boulders around them crumbled and fell, removing any stable footholds for Gain to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now we’re on the same field&#8230;right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haha, I wonder&#8230;I cannot use the boulders as foothold anymore, but that goes for you too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain looked at the cracked ground at his feet and furrowed his brow. He did not lose his composure, however, as he approached Reito and Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The time for games is over&#8230;I’m going to cut you down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh really&#8230;do your worst.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrowl!!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-76901180' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-76901180' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr felt Gain’s unbridled killing intent and prepared to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle had become a pure duel to the death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito drew his Cleansing Blade: a broadsword made with the strongest metal of his former world. He thought back to his training in the Abyssal Forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strike Blade, a skill passed to him by the one person who defeated Gain in the past. Reito had used it as a base to craft a new skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secret behind Strike Blade was to use all of the body’s muscles when swinging the sword. Reito activated a Support magic spell to boost his physical abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Muscle Boost!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;.Support magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain looked at Reito and stopped in his tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Support Magicians used Support magic: learning that his opponent was a hopeless Job holder, Gain was first surprised, then utterly dejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How dull&#8230;die.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain’s interest in Reito vanished completely: he moved to finish the battle then and there. He placed a hand on the hilt of his katana and activated his characteristic Battle Art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unsheathe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shield!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Barrier Stone on his Magic Ring and defended himself against Gain’s katana with the green shield. It was extremely effective at blocking physical attacks, as Gain realized with great surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A barrier?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr jumped at Gain, taking advantage of the opening, but the Vampire jumped backwards to dodge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito managed to parry Gain’s attack, but could not nullify the impact and was forced to let go of his Cleansing Sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, you have a Barrier Stone with you&#8230;there is no point if you can only protect your arm, though. This is the end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain smiled at the defenseless Reito. He put his katana back in the scabbard and prepared to use Unsheathe again, when—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t be so sure!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took a small satchel hanging at his waist and threw it at Gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain reflexively reacted to the unexpected attack by slicing the satchel, which contained a Decay Stone ground into dust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain was showered with the dust and screamed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWAAHHHHH! THIS SMELL…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain’s arrogance and confidence were completely gone: he rolled and writhed on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decay Stones were harmless to humans, but monsters loathed the stench they emanated. Demons possessed both human and monster traits: the Vampire Gain was no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito remembered that Basil used ground monster feces to incapacitate Ullr. He asked Airis for advice and ground the Decay Stone into dust and stuffed it into a satchel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, Ullr was not as affected by the Decay Stone thanks to training he received from his former caretaker, the female Elf Mille. Regular monsters would run away at the smell of a Decay Stone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr, stay away!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn you…!! The smell&#8230;I can’t…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain dropped his weapon to cover his face. Reito did not pick up his own weapon and faced him unarmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He stepped forward with good momentum, rotated and accelerated his sole, ankle, knee, hips, abdomen, torso, shoulder and elbow, in that order, and struck with his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bullet Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fist hit the helpless Gain in the face and sent him flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, however, felt something was off when his fist made contact. Gain had jumped backwards right before impact, to reduce it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito picked up his Cleansing Sword and prepared for Gain’s counter offensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch&#8230;how dare you…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain manipulated a thread to retrieve his katana. The katana, scabbard and Gain’s waist were connected with a kind of wire, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain glared at Reito, his handsome features marred by tears and snot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re dead&#8230;you’re dead!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, calm down&#8230;is this the real you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SHUT UP!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain stretched his hand towards the hilt of the katana and prepared to use Unsheathe again, but Reito’s broadsword was faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, using the same muscular movement needed for Strike Blade, activated his signature Spin Strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whaaat!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito powerfully stomped the ground and swept his broadsword horizontally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slash was not only much faster than the regular Spin Strike, it also carried all of Reito’s muscular power as it struck Gain. He had achieved maximum speed from the first rotation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parry&#8230;gwah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain activated a defensive Battle Art and tried parrying the broadsword with his scabbard, but could not stop the broadsword’s momentum: his skin was torn and shredded, spurting blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito frowned, but did not relent and stepped forward again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet&#8230;Smasher!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gripped his broadsword tight so as not to drop it, then swung it down in a vertical slash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmet Smasher was the combination of Helmet Splitter and Strike Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The muscular movement of Strike Blade, paired with Helmet Splitter, the Battle Art Reito was most proficient with, formed Helmet Smasher: the speed of this slash was even higher than Reito’s previous attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHAAH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain, holding his arm, managed to dodge the attack by a hair’s breadth, but the wind displaced by the slash blew him backwards, as the ground at their feet caved in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain stumbled and fell backwards, but Reito endured the impact with both arms and went on to attack again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not done yet!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DAMN YOU, BRAT!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain raged at Reito’s unrelenting offensive. He needed to be standing on the ground with both legs to use Unsheathe, however. Before he could stand back up, Reito unleashed the final skill he acquired during his training in the Abyssal Forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whirlwind Strike!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWAAHHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the Battle Art born from the combination of Whirlwind and Strike Blade. The sound of the blade cutting through the air and Gain’s screams echoed throughout the mines: the next instant, the earth shook with a tremendous impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;shit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaaah….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cursed under his breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Cleansing Blade had cut into Gain’s abdomen, but he had not stepped forward with enough strength: the blade failed to completely sever his opponent’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had learned the skill only recently, his muscles were nearing their limit — and he hesitated before delivering the killing blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the blade deeply lodged into his stomach, Gain had not lost consciousness: he glared at Reito as he spat blood, then tried to draw the katana at his waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8230;scum…!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain drew his blade in a flash and sliced Reito’s left cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His katana, an enchanted weapon called Crimson Devil Blade, could increase in hardness by absorbing fresh blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not stagger, however, and readied his Cleansing Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaaah!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used the Alchemist skill Shape Change to make the blade of his Cleansing Sword vibrate at high speed. As a result, the sword tore deeper into Gain’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain, his bloodshot eyes open wide, swung around his katana in a desperate attempt to counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito ignored his opponent’s frantic attacks and swung his Cleansing Sword to the end, slicing through Gain’s torso with good momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HAAAAAH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWAAAAAAHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain’s torso presented a large, gaping gash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A torrent of blood sprayed from the wound, but his upper and lower body were still attached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated Leap to put some distance between him and his opponent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S..shit…!! My&#8230;my body…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re still alive…? What a monster&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaaah….!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain stood up, holding his body together: the next instant, a cloud of red smoke surrounded him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vampires had excellent recovery capabilities, which could be boosted further by absorbing the blood of other living creatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain took out a vial he kept hidden in his clothes and poured the human blood inside on his torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grruuuaaaaaah….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ugh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery did not come without pain, apparently. Gain endured the sealing of the wound on his torso, a grimace of pain on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the process, a tense look on his face, but did not lose the opportunity to use Recovery Boost on himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;you won’t get away with this&#8230;I’ll definitely kill you…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I’ve heard that already&#8230;Ice Blade Bullet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before his opponent could fully recover, Reito created Ice Block blades and shot them, but Gain swung his Crimson Devil Blade, fast enough to draw afterimages in the air, and shattered all of Reito’s ice blades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Vision Blade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, Reito thought Gain had created several blades out of thin air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis had told him in advance about Gain’s skill to create countless blade afterimages, but witnessing it in person made him have cold sweats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could not track the movements of those blades with his eyes: if he locked swords with Gain without a plan, he would be surely torn to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve finally used it&#8230;but you need a stable foothold to use that skill, don’t you!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the—!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put his palm on the ground and activated Earth Block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Battle Art Vision Blade required both arms to move at high speed and high concentration: if the user’s attention was drawn to something else, even for an instant, it was not possible to maintain it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used Earth Block to depress the ground at Gain’s feet, forcing him to deactivate Vision Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain emerged from the pit and sheathed his katana, ready to use his Unsheathe skill. He drew a deep breath and glared at Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To see through my Vision Blade like that&#8230;who exactly are you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Someone who has no reason to answer you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case&#8230;it’s over, die.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No point in threats. Your sword range isn’t limitless, is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsheathe, just like Vision Blade, could only cut the opponent in a fixed range. In other words, Reito could not be cut as long as he stayed out of Gain’s range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wound on Gain’s left eye was caused by Bal when she realized such a weakness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Which one of us has the longer blade, now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;what are you saying?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ll see soon enough&#8230;Gravity Blade.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson magic power surged from Reito’s fist. He held his broadsword directly in front of himself. Gain prepared to counterattack and grinned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was genuinely enjoying the battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Gain was interested in Reito because his sword techniques resembled Bal’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s skill with the sword, however, was far inferior to hers, and he even used a moronic diversion with the Decay Stone dust. Gain decided to get rid of him immediately but was unexpectedly pushed to a disadvantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain was foiled time and again by Reito’s ability to read his strategies. He even risked being cleaved in half at one point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more Gain was cornered, the more his interest in Reito grew. Even if he taunted him, Gain gained some respect for the young and immature swordsman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had apparently already figured out the weak point of Unsheathe and Vision Blade, but Gain didn’t care anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was now simply excited to see what move Reito was going to show him next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come at me…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain, his Crimson Devil Blade still in the scabbard, did not move an inch. Reito, on the other hand, held his broadsword tight, to calm himself down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson magic power surged from Reito’s arms: he enhanced his physical abilities to the max and stepped forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stepped forcefully on the ground and swung his Cleansing Blade.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-29931062' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-29931062' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his movements, Gain felt all of his expectations had been betrayed. He looked intently at Reito’s blade as it came swinging down and moved his right hand, placed on his katana’s hilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One year before, Gain had lost his left eye to Bal’s sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain lost because Bal attacked from outside his sword’s range. Unsheathe and Vision Blade couldn’t reach her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal’s broadsword was far longer than the katana he wielded at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She attacked from outside Gain’s range, ultimately wounding his left eye, without giving Gain a chance to counterattack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain’s current opponent was using the exact same strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain drew his sword from the scabbard: at the same time, he moved one step forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the defeat against Bal, Gain had analyzed his weakness and acquired a new skill, an evolution of Unsheathe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took the stance to use Unsheathe and moved forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That skill, Sliding Step, could be used to counterattack by surprise an opponent convinced to be outside of Gain’s range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ — Unsheathe!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;..!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain approached Reito, as the latter was bringing down his broadsword, and drew his katana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, however, did not fear his opponent’s offensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He focused on his hands gripping the broadsword and activated a Support spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Magic Power Boost!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next instant, the crimson magic power surrounding Reito’s Cleansing Blade glowed brighter, accelerating the sword’s downward swing. Magic Power Boost had reinforced the gravity pull on the blade and raised its speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(To be able to go so far&#8230;incredible!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain’s reaction to Reito’s attack, however, was euphoric. He had lived over a century but had never met a human being that fought like Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain was entranced by the blade approaching his neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his eyes, Reito’s broadsword descended on him little by little, as if in slow motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gain concentrated fully, any kind of attack became excruciatingly slow to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then spoke to Reito, out of pity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was fun, but now it’s really over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;.!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words could not reach Reito, however. Gain gripped his Crimson Devil Blade and swung it, targeting Reito’s torso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The katana moved much faster than Reito’s broadsword ever could. The instant before Reito’s torso was sliced open — a sharp pain struck Gain’s back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain turned around: a short sword had sunk deep into his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His concentration broke, and Reito’s movements accelerated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cleansing Blade tore into Gain’s right shoulder, cutting through the Vampire’s flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HAAAAAHHHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWAAAHHHHHH….!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cleansing Blade had fully severed Gain’s body this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain let go of the Crimson Devil Blade, which flew over Reito as he crouched after swinging the Cleansing Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain, his body torn in two halves, watched Reito as he slumped to the floor, together with his broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah&#8230;hah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haha&#8230;HAHAHAHAHA!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;.!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with his body torn from the right shoulder down, Gain laughed loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Reito — despite his successful attack — was terribly pale. He looked up and found Gain smiling broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s finally&#8230;over&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh….?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can be&#8230;human&#8230;again&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;human…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An innocent, boyish smile formed on Gain’s lips — as a cloud of red smoke erupted from his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vampire’s body shriveled and shrunk, as if dozens of years of aging had their effects in seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Gain’s severed body collapsed on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Than&#8230;k&#8230;you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain drew his last breath with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had lived with the pain of loving humans, yet being forced to make them suffer. He was thus grateful to be finally released from such a cycle of suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also true that Gain found pleasure in murder: he had not been always like that, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gain had begun to kill in order to survive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he didn’t take the blood of other living beings, he could not live on. Bound by such a fate, he continued to kill more and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His personality was eventually twisted, by all the lives he took and the murders he committed: he ended up replacing the guilt with pleasure. That was how he kept his sanity as a Vampire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhere in his heart, however, he wished to be saved. He would have never expected for that to happen at the hands of a young man he had just met, though…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;did we win?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AWOOOO!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Reito’s question, Ullr howled loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at his broadsword, looking for Gain’s blood. The blood too, just like Gain’s corpse, had turned into red smoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blood of Vampires, for unknown reasons, disappeared once it left their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Gain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put back his broadsword and touched the wound on his cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was an opponent much more powerful than anyone Reito had ever faced. His sword skills were superlative: the battle against him would become a significant experience for Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and his partner Ullr climbed down the mountain. They did not want to see that place again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, exhausted, entrusted his body to Ullr, and the two left the Ymir coal mines.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the battle against Gain, on their way back to the city, Reito was so tired he decided to camp outside on the plains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the risk of monsters finding them, but Ullr would notice any such uninvited guests. Reito let Ullr stand guard and wrapped himself in his partner’s warm fur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s cold, Ullr, wrap me a bit tighter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr sighed and complied, covering Reito’s body with his. Reito let himself go in the warmth of his partner’s body and was reminded of his mother Aira covering him with a blanket, when he was still a baby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;Airis, are you still up?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, I am. I basically never sleep, actually.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito considered for a moment whether to ask about his mother or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He regularly asked Airis about how his mother was doing after he left the residence. He had had fewer chances to do so recently, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Is mother&#8230;doing fine?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, she is.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Is there anything else you want to know?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis seemed to know Reito had something on his mind. All sorts of questions floated in his head, but he ultimately decided not to say anything.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;no, it’s okay. Not now, at least.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Is that so&#8230;Reito, please remember this. It is not possible for you to see your mother&#8230;or Aria now. So&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I know.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cut off the communication before Airis finished her sentence. He pulled Ullr’s head closer and went to sleep.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following day, a certain former adventurer arrived at the Ymir coal mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was shaken to see the state the excavation site was in: she then found the corpse of the person she was looking for and quietly gazed down at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you&#8230;really Gain?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal recognized Gain’s corpse and fell to her knees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man she had sought revenge against for 20 years was dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corpse lying before her showed signs of extreme aging, but she would recognize it anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the hell is this…!? Why are you in a place like this, killed by someone other than me!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal drew the broadsword on her back and swung it down, as to smash it against Gain’s corpse&#8230;but stopped before actually doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite all the hate she bore towards him, her pride wouldn’t allow her to maim a corpse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn you&#8230;damn it all!! Why&#8230;why…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal herself did not know who her words were aimed at. Tears flowed from her eyes as she silently looked down at Gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then held up her sword again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;goddamnit!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could not attack the corpse, after all. Bal let go of her broadsword, cursing under her breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then punched a nearby boulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood trickled from her fist as cracks spread throughout the boulder&#8230;eventually causing the boulder to shatter.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal’s actions before Gain’s corpse were being observed from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man approximately 40 years old, hidden behind a large boulder, was watching Bal with the Far Sight skill, a nasty grin on his lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Goblins were with him, all lying on the ground in the same way. The man’s name was Bubee: he too belonged to the pro-empire faction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hee hee hee&#8230;I saw it all, heard it all, know it all!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who’d ever thought Lord Gain could be killed…! Things are getting really interesting&#8230;now I’m the only survivor&#8230;haha!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not worried in the least about the fact that all pro-empire faction Monster Tamers except him had been defeated, On the contrary, he was gloating at the prospect of his rank increasing because of his status as survivor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monster Tamers were a precious asset: the pro-empire faction would surely ensure he was treated with the utmost care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Too bad about Basil and Lord Gain&#8230;I’d never expect them to be defeated, but thanks to that my standing is rock solid now. Hee hee hee&#8230;you critters are lucky to be serving me, you’d be dead if you were with the others&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubee was about to turn towards the Goblins under his command, when he noticed something was off. The smell of blood tickled his nostrils—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uh…? Where did my left arm go…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubee noticed the space once occupied by his left arm was now empty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next instant, a sharp pain coursed through his body: he wanted to scream, but his mouth was closed by someone appearing behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nngh!? Nnggghh!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quiet now&#8230;or I can’t kill you easily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a female voice. Bubee’s body stiffened as a crimson blade emerged from his chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before his heart was pierced, Bubee recognized the blade: it was Gain’s Crimson Devil Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubee’s body slumped down to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mission accomplished&#8230;returning to base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After killing Bubee, the woman looked down at his corpse, the Crimson Devil Blade in hand. For a single instant, she looked in the direction Reito had headed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She opened her mouth, but said nothing and disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of her hands held the Crimson Devil Blade, the other a bloody dagger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, all armed Goblins which had attacked towns and villages in the area were released from the Monster Tamers’ control: they all returned to the wild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pro-empire faction’s involvement in the matter became widely known, so the Baltros kingdom officially started moving for a thorough annihilation of the faction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Tiger adventurers’ guild, which had captured two of the faction’s Monster Tamers, received a substantial reward as its name spread throughout the kingdom. The guild earned the kingdom’s trust, which boosted Bal’s reputation as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal herself, however, barely even registered such events: the shock of Gain’s death at the hands of someone else was too intense. She attempted to leave her position as guildmaster, but was desperately held back by those around her and eventually gave up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great boost in popularity of the Black Tigers guild, however, also disrupted the balance of power between the guilds in the Adventure City.</span></p>
