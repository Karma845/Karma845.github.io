<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4: Rain</h1>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san!?” “Yuunagi-kun!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was Sunday afternoon, a day after the G incident.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We happened to meet inside a supermarket near the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Living in the same area, it’s natural that we’d use the same shops.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, it wasn’t impossible that we might run into each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, meeting in a place that’s neither home nor school feels odd.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looks cute in her casual clothes today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not the formal suit she wears at school nor the relaxed home wear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her spring-like, light-colored, thin dress paired with a denim jacket and her long hair casually tied at the bottom in two places made her look younger than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It seems we’ve chosen similar outfits. Like a matching pair.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was also wearing a denim jacket over my shirt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If it bothers you, I can take it off if you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m fine with it. It’s surprisingly cold inside the supermarket.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We started walking, as standing around would be in the way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is everything okay at your place since then?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. I burned the smoke thing yesterday, so my home’s defenses have significantly improved.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you ever have any trouble, feel free to ask me for help.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Next time, I’ll run to you before I scream. Are you shopping, Yuunagi-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Were you going somewhere, Tenjō-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, just like you, I’m out for groceries.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your nice outfit made me think you were out for fun. It suits you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you. But it’s just my usual attire.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe it looks good because of who’s wearing it and what she’s wearing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Flattering me won’t get you anything.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Being in a supermarket, of course Tenjō-san’s shopping basket was filled with groceries.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I could have cooked for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got a bit of free time thanks to you. Thought I might cook for myself on my day off.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can eat whatever you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just so you know, I have absolutely no complaints about your cooking! Just to be clear!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san hurriedly corrects my casual remark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is there anything you’d like to eat later? I can buy the ingredients.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, what should I choose? I actually look forward to seeing what you’ll come up with each time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That much?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a great motivation for work.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I must put in more effort.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Yuunagi-kun, is there anything you’d like to eat? I could share with you tonight if you want.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We smile together, recalling how we met.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You don’t have to push yourself too hard. You should rest properly on your day off.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a way of returning the favor.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel bad about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, let’s go with the classic meat and potato stew!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I hesitate, Tenjō-san decides on her own.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, we haven’t made meat and potato stew yet, have we? Maybe I should try it too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey-hey, what’s the point if you’re the one who makes it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She lightly slapped me on the back.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wouldn’t you be excited if the Onee-san next door brought over her classic meat and potato stew?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d be super excited.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll do it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san quickly went back to get the necessary ingredients, and I followed her around the store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After that, we finished our shopping and left the supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since we live in the same apartment, we naturally took the same way home.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Walking through the shopping street near the station, I was attracted by the word ‘croquettes’ on the front of a butcher’s store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was snack time, and I was a bit hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking at Tenjō-san, she seemed interested in the croquettes too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The butcher’s wife noticed us standing together and called out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You there, the couple, try these freshly fried croquettes, they’re delicious. How about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">” ” Couple!? ” “</p>

<p class="calibre4">At that sales pitch, Tenjō-san and I looked at each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do we look like that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe she misunderstood because we’re dressed similarly and carrying big bags of groceries from the supermarket.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a mismatched combination, but that’s some aggressive salesmanship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, in customer service, how much you get noticed by the customers is important.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since we’re here, why not try the freshly fried ones?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I agree.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then Tenjō-san bought croquettes for both of us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, your hands are full, so it might be hard to eat while walking.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can go ahead and eat it first, Tenjō-san. It’s freshly fried.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should taste it too. Here.”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00012.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san offers me the croquette at my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you saying I should eat it like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it’s best eaten while it’s still crispy and fluffy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s embarrassing, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No one’s watching. Come on, eat it before it gets cold.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t resist the temptation of the freshly fried treat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s bad manners to eat food like this, but I decide to bite into it boldly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Occasionally, Tenjō-san feeds me as we walk back to the apartment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How does it taste?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I say, careful not to burn my mouth as I eat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, it really is good. I’ve never had it before because the shop is usually closed when I return.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Store-fried foods are mostly delicious. Trying to fry at home still seems like a high hurdle for me though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, even you have things you’re not good at, Yuunagi-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve only been living alone for just under a year.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would be a big deal if you could deep-fry food well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, are you expecting me to be good at it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll leave that interpretation up to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would be impressive to improve by summer vacation. Plus, frying in summer…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…? Why is there a deadline until summer vacation?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh, about the moving…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Feeling apologetic, I recall what we had agreed upon during our ‘Neighbor Agreement’.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah… Yes, that’s right. We did make that promise.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it’s a problem, please don’t force yourself. After all, I should be the one who…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s an adult’s responsibility to take on such troublesome matters.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san puts on her teacher’s face and looks up at the sky.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…hey, looks like it’s going to rain.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Despite the morning’s sunshine, I realized the sky had become overcast.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Didn’t you check the weather forecast? It’s going to rain today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What!? My laundry is still hanging out!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just then, a drop of rain falls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the rain intensifies and quickly darkens the asphalt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, Tenjō-san! I have a folding umbrella with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s close by, so I’ll be fine!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then let’s run!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We hurried along, gripping our shopping bags tightly in the increasingly heavy rain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was only a few minutes to the apartment, but the rain grew fiercer by the second.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t running pointless at this point?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I call out while getting drenched.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just hung up all that laundry I had accumulated! I don’t want to have to wash it again!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Seems like Tenjō-san is determined not to give up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t slip!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The asphalt is completely wet and glistening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our apartment comes into view.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun! Sorry, can you help me? There’s quite a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We open the door to room 103 and rush in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without worrying about wetting the hallway, we dash through the room and open the windows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Working together, we hurriedly take down the laundry hanging on the drying poles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once everything is stored inside, a pile of laundry forms on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, we take off our wet jackets.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wow…everything’s soaked. Looks like I’ll have to rewash them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is there anything I can help with for laundry?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I offer help to a dejected Tenjō-san.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In what world would there be a female teacher who lets a male student hang her underwear!? Is this some kind of play?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I mean, except the underwear of course. It would be awkward for me too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I calmly retort.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, do you actually have no immunity to men?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh? I’m not. I don’t have a problem with you approaching me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I reflexively step back as Tenjō-san suddenly comes close and gets worked up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not seeing where I was stepping, I kicked a trash can unintentionally. Then I lost my balance and fell to the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to brace myself, I hit my back and felt a dull impact.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A voiceless groan escaped me, and in the discomfort of pain, all I could do was grimace and close my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, Yuunagi-kun!? Are you okay? That was a loud noise.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice got closer, so she must have come to my side.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It hurts so much it feels like I’m dying…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, that’s not good. Should we go to the hospital?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just let me rest for a while, it should be fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is there anything you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can I have a cushion?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It hurts, and I don’t feel like moving for a while. I think I need to lie on the floor for a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be nice if I could borrow a cushion nearby as a makeshift pillow.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright. Here, raise your head. Okay…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I do as I’m told, lifting my neck and relaxing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This cushion feels weird. It doesn’t feel like fabric, it’s soft and warm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I open my eyes, Tenjō-san’s face is right above me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her tied hair has come undone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How is it? Do you feel sick or anything after hitting your head?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you seriously giving me a lap pillow?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, if it’s uncomfortable, I’ll stop.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Trying not to show her embarrassment, she avoids looking at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s the most comfortable I’ve ever been.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then that’s good.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Because of the rain, everything in the dim room with only the faint light from outside and the sound of rain seems different.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her pale lips and hair seem more lustrous than usual, and her wet, clinging clothes reveal the lines of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The curves of her chest and hips contrast with her slender arms, legs and shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Above all, I’m surprised by the softness of the body that was touching me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Don’t look up, my innerwear might be showing through.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We remain still, feeling each other’s body heat as time passes.</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00006.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">“The rain is intense, and it’s getting stronger.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re lucky we got back before it turned into a downpour.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your room is next door, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I’m bothering you, I’ll leave.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll leave the timing to you. At this point, both our rooms feel like one and the same.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Perhaps influenced by the lap pillow, she utters those words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A fierce light rips through the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman’s face is illuminated by the flash of lightning, appearing monochromatic to my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then comes the thunder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The intense sound, as if shattering the world, makes droplets from her wet hair fall on my cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s cold.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I should get a towel before you catch a cold. I was careless. I’ll bring one right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before she can stand up, I impulsively move and grab her wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stiffens and doesn’t move.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s as if time stands still unless I take another action.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the discomfort of my rain-soaked shirt clinging to me, my body feels unusually hot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m acutely aware of the suppressed flames of desire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My heart races as if it’s about to burst.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intense sound of the rain fills the room, drowning out all other noises.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of my movements is surely inaudible in this room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It almost feels like a permission granted by the heavens.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san, with her back turned, takes a deep breath through her shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pull the arm of the person I used to only look up to and gently seat her back on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I let go of her hand, but she doesn’t run away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you cold from being wet?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was warm because of your body heat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That sounds somewhat lewd.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think one is free to interpret it as they like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it because I did something unnecessary?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“For me, it was the best pillow of my life. I wanted to keep sleeping like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then my legs would go numb.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why did you give me a lap pillow then?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I ask, curious.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“On the contrary, what do you want from me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her question was more straightforward than ever before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I want to get closer to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that love? Or lust?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Both. I’m not so clever or simple enough to act on just one.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Love and lust are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Neither is more noble or dirty than the other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think humans live in a mix of unconditional love and unavoidable physiological desires.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed to me that this encapsulates the complexity of human nature.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sure you and I are just being swept away by the mood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am not.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was certain about that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, are you interested in me just because I’m a convenient woman who’s close by?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it were for such a cheap reason, I would have already taken you to my bed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She shivered at my words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah… I’m sorry. I mean, I cherish you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;I’m not as great a woman as you expect.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She whispered, her face downcast.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sensed an unpleasant turn in the conversation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">The woman in front of me suddenly spoke bluntly, as if she had become a different person.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It would be so easy to just go with the flow and accept you as a man. To be honest and not think about the consequences can be satisfying…but would that really make you and me happier?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While she seemed to understand, she laid out her logic, and it felt like her heart, which had seemed so close just moments ago, was drifting away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was wrong to lead you on. The time we spent together was truly enjoyable, and your cooking made me happy. But it’s not good for us to have a deeper relationship.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to become a bitter memory for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before I could interject, she rapidly expressed her feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s doomed to fail…is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The students will graduate. Once this student-teacher relationship ends, this closeness will inevitably change.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to change it for the better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Thank you for being brave. It made me realize my own irresponsibility.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As she stands up, a fierce flash of lightning illuminates the room in white.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her shadow looms in black as she turns her back to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The pain has subsided, right? Then, you should go back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She points to the door without looking at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t act like you’re the only one to blame and resolve this on your own. This is a problem for both of us.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I stand up as well.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just be obedient and follow along.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You said it yourself, Tenjō-san. ‘I don’t want to become a bitter memory for you.’ “</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So what?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She tilts her head wearily, looking annoyed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s ridiculous. Who decided our relationship has to end badly?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The future is unknown to anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed to me that she was avoiding moving forward because she didn’t want the current relationship to end.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;This relationship has been wrong from the start!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She gets agitated but still doesn’t look at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What I want to know isn’t some ‘plausible’ adult excuse. I want to know your true feelings.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō could have taken advantage of me with a mature attitude or coldly pushed me away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, she’s indecisive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Encouraging me to leave, yet unable to clearly reject me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she still won’t face me, I try to take her hand one more time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Stop it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Pushing away her hand forcefully, she accidentally hits my cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I’m sorry…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She apologizes immediately and finally looks up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She doesn’t seem angry or disgusted, but rather, she looks concerned about me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you’re really bad at acting.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I move slightly closer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She pulls back as if to escape, seemingly forgetting that the bed is behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Caught off guard, she falls back onto the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…No way.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She’s taken aback by how easily she ended up on the bed due to my slight movement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To prevent her from escaping, I too, climb onto the bed, covering her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The single bed creaks under the weight of both of us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This is not my intention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But just like when we met over shared food, she tried to avoid crucial conversations by running away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I back down now, I’m not sure I’ll have the courage to initiate this conversation again.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re going to keep evading me, I don’t know what I would do…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to keep my tone as joking and frivolous as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I hoped that if I turned this into our usual meaningless banter, it would be easier for her to talk.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t get on my bed without permission.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She regains her assertiveness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You were sleeping on my bed too, weren’t you, Tenjō-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“T-that was an accident!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then this is also an accident.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I boldly retort, she glares at me with a sulky expression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, she soon complains in a faint voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve never been pushed down by a man before…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was pretty easy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, is that some kind of special technique that you have?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her attempt to bluff with all her might was cute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I had such techniques, I would have used them to kiss Tenjō-san first.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She hastily covers her lips with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but laugh. No man could remain unmoved by such an innocent reaction from a beautiful older woman like her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I only wanted to kiss you, I would have done it quietly while you were asleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so?.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Tenjō-san, you’re too defenseless.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know how you can stand it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I couldn’t, and that’s why I got slapped earlier.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I admit my own folly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That was an accident… Did it hurt?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even now, she can’t hide her sweetness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She reaches out to my cheek with concern. Her cold hand feels pleasant on my heated cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you like pain? Are you a masochist or something?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Being intensely led by an older Onee-san isn’t too bad.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t casually express your own desires! …it puts pressure on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, what does that mean!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t look so blatantly happy, you idiot!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With the hand gently touching my cheek, she tries to push my face away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Because it makes me start to have expectations.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Under me, she stiffens, her gaze darting back and forth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wait for her next words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I even once accept my own desires and feelings, I think I won’t be able to hold back anymore. I’d want more and more things and wouldn’t be able to stop. But I can’t imagine this relationship working out any better than it is now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why do you assume it won’t work?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Because I don’t believe in eternal love.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I am slightly lost for words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s hard to believe such a beautiful person would express such self-doubt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You must have been put off, right, hearing a woman over twenty saying this? Right? You’re put off, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s so girly and cute.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Ah, shut up! Don’t just accept it! Do you have a Pacific ocean-wide heart?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you saying, you who are like the sun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s what I’m talking about! The real me isn’t as beautiful or admirable as you think I am! And being older and a Sensei, even if it’s okay now, there will definitely come a day when you’re disillusioned with me! I’m afraid and hate that ending! That’s why I can’t move forward!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked as if she was about to cry, like a child throwing a tantrum.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please…just go home for today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This time, I had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Yuunagi Nishiki wasn’t a student but in a different position, would you have accepted me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I were older than Reiyu Tenjō, could this relationship have progressed further?</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I had been a man she could rely on without fear or hesitation, would she not have any struggle?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, the problem is surely not just that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">If the feelings growing between us are love, then merely taking a step forward as we are now is not enough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unless I can erase her distrust in ‘love’ that she herself harbors, we’re likely to end up with a sad conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She knows this too, which is why she’s hesitant to rush into what lies ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She prefers the ambiguous yet comfortable present over a future where she might get hurt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Right now, even if I make the person I like to cry, I can’t stop her tears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was frustrated with myself for that.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre7">Interlude 4</strong></p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre7">Without You 1</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">『To summarize, ‘It turns out that my next-door neighbor is my student, and after living for nearly a month with meals being prepared for me, I was starting to not mind being with him. But then I freaked out and rejected him after seeing a new side of him I didn’t expect!’ Are you a demon? That’s too cruel! Poor guy.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">The night Yuunagi-kun left, I couldn’t keep it to myself and ended up spilling everything to my best friend over the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t summarize it so bluntly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Don’t whine! The one who’s probably about to cry is that neighbor boy!』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her harsh words made me involuntarily glance at the wall that borders the room next door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Ah~ There’s so much to critique here, I don’t even know where to start. Give me back the excitement I felt when Reiyu-chan first came to me for love advice.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I heard a deep sigh over the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not like it’s a love advice! It’s just a neighborhood issue.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『You know, when a man and a woman meet, there’s always the potential for romance! Those insignificant days can turn into the beginning of a relationship when you look back later. In other words, everything is love advice!』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She argued more strongly than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Love advice…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wonder if this feeling of mine can be classified as love.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『What I want to hear are happy stories from Reiyu-chan, not such a serious and heavy tale of failure!』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, romantic advice is usually heavy, isn’t it? And what do you mean by failure…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Having it labeled as a failure hurt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『You had a once-in-a-lifetime chance with someone you were interested in, and you blew it yourself. It’s nothing but a failure! Why didn’t you consult me earlier!?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend who has been watching over me since my teens was angry as if it were her own matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her words were unusually stern.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But I only asked for his help because of the sudden rain. And I was just worried about him collapsing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『And in the end, it was you who tempted him, Reiyu-chan.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Temptation? No way, that’s not it…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s not my intention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I was aware that I had been bolder than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『If we count all your misdemeanors just for today, there’d be no end. You ran into him at the supermarket, had him carry your bags, and walked home together. You bought snacks on the way and fed him croquettes since his hands were full. You made him help bring in your laundry because it started raining. And then there’s the knee pillow&mdash;oh, how naughty.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not naughty! It was just taking care of him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『By doing all those things, Reiyu-chan, it’s only natural for a man to make a move. If you really did all of that without any intention, I’d label you a terrible person and cut ties with you right now.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s tough to have all my actions from today scrutinized, even though I explained everything openly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just stop it, I’m devastated.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『The one who’s really devastated is him! This could traumatize him for life.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m left speechless by the assertive statement that leaves no room for a reply.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Listen, men are fundamentally timid creatures. Unless they’re overly confident or unreasonable, they’ll look for a chance but struggle to muster the courage. Reiyu-chan, at times like this, goes along with the mood and pretending a little is where women shine.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Coming from someone who had captured and let go of many men’s hearts, her words carried weight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Honestly, it was a technique beyond my realm.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is romance something that can be thought out like that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Or maybe he’s just very mature. Considering that a certain duck who is new to love comes to a man’s room every night carrying a leek on her back, it’s amazing that he hasn’t pounced on you, driven by his youthful desires.』(TN: Duck here means naive/ unaware.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was so surprised my voice cracked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『He takes care of you diligently without expecting anything in return. Such a promising and excellent prospect, I’d like to date him myself.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s a high school student! What are you saying!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Why act so high and mighty after avoiding him yourself? Poor neighbor boy, I want to comfort him…』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend consistently sided with Yuunagi-kun.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t rejected him yet. And he hasn’t clearly confessed his feelings either…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was desperately trying to justify myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『It’s almost as if he’s already said he likes you! Reiyu-chan, you’re clearly interested in him since you’ve spent so much time together. The fact that you’re coming to me like this is proof enough!』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that really the case? I guess it would turn out like that huh… Probably, yeah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Wow, liking someone but avoiding them, you’re a real pain in a real-life romance. Tsundere is only acceptable in two dimensions.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend was totally put off.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just can’t handle the games of love.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『In this world, there are people who date just to try it out if they don’t dislike each other.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can I be so insincere to him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『It’s all well and good to pretend to be a sensible adult, but you’re not really putting it into practice at all.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend was harshly honest.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『By the way, women around him definitely notice a caring, straightforward guy like your neighbor. You think you’re keeping him on hold, but before you know it, he might start dating someone else.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was dismissed with a cold, cutting remark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“He’s not that kind of frivolous guy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『That’s all wishful thinking on Reiyu-chan’s part.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t scare me like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『It’s just the truth.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t say anything in response.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『&mdash;&mdash;I know Reiyu-chan wouldn’t give a knee pillow to someone she doesn’t like. That’s why I wanted you to be prepared, at least mentally. I genuinely want to support and help achieve the slightly delayed first love of my best friend.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend confessed her deep regret.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My…my first love?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Moreover, it’s a romance of exceptionally high difficulty for a beginner like you. Rushing in driven by desire, you risk losing too much if you get exposed.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend knows I grew up in a loveless family environment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She also understands how much I’ve invested in becoming a teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why she empathizes deeply and encourages me firmly, but she doesn’t recklessly push me forward.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. It’s scary…it’s like I’m not myself anymore.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I’m with him, I lose control of my emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My excitement grows, calmness fades, reason slackens, common sense numbs, optimism strengthens, and actions become bolder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s embarrassing but not unpleasant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I feel tense yet reassured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want to touch him but also don’t want to be touched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Contradictory feelings and desires emerge.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ve never dated a man before, so everything feels new.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Experiencing countless firsts has been enjoyable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With his support, my feelings have become positive, and there’s more enthusiasm in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ordinary days pass by as something special when we’re together.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre7">Interlude 4</strong></p>
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre7">Without You 2</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">『Yes, first love is a painful thing.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel like crying at my best friend’s affirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s too late to experience first love, yet too early to meet him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m an adult now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">His kindness makes me happy, but the situation where I can’t honestly accept it is painful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As long as we are a teacher and a student, the emotions named love that sprout between us are a forbidden fruit that must never come to fruition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, there’s a part of me that wants to reach out for it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Reiyu-chan, having seen your parents’ troubles, it’s understandable that you’re scared to fall in love. It’s not your fault, as no one can choose the family they’re born into. Don’t get that wrong.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『But, it’s unfair to end things by just imposing your situation on him.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『First of all, the guy next door understands the age and position differences between you two and still supports you, an inexperienced older woman. As your best friend, I can’t forgive you if you’re being unfair to such a kind-hearted person. After that, you are free to do whatever you want!』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend scolds me more earnestly than anyone else.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I engrave her words deeply into myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before hanging up, my best friend offered one last piece of advice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Even though many loves fade, if it’s true love, any trouble or obstacle is just a stepping stone that strengthens the bond between two people.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I have no confidence I can move towards the future I desire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I didn’t want things to end awkwardly as they are.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t want to lose this important relationship we have now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s the true feeling of Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">To keep a small promise I had made, I found myself in the kitchen, even though it was late at night.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, on Monday morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I arrived at the classroom, the seat in front of me was empty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi Nishiki, who usually looked up to me, was unusually late.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Glancing towards the window, Akira Kuhouin was seated on time as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, can I start the class?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I stood silently at the podium, the class representative called out to me, snapping me back to reality.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even after finishing the morning homeroom, Yuunagi-kun still hadn’t shown up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but worry if yesterday’s incident was the reason.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Should I take a chance and send him a message later?</p>

<p class="calibre4">We usually keep to private communication, so we don’t talk about school-related things.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This morning, I couldn’t bring myself to let him know whether I’d have breakfast or not, so I came to school without stopping by his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I regretted not making up my mind to see him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Being proactive is almost synonymous with taking action.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I loathed my own weakness for not being able to act as if My resolution from last night vanished somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I realized how amazing the courage he had shown me yesterday was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While I was pondering this, Kuhouin-san approached me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei, may I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was the first time Kuhouin-san had initiated a conversation with me, and it caught me off guard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I forced a smile, but the words of my best friend from last night suddenly resurfaced in my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『&mdash;&mdash;before you know it, he might start dating someone else.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Those words stirred my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki is sick with a cold and won’t be coming today. He asked me to tell you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin-san’s expression remained unchanged as she bluntly relayed the message.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A cold!? Is his fever high?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was astonished by the unexpected news.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe getting wet in the rain was bad for him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know the details. But Sensei, aren’t you overreacting?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah&mdash;ahaha. Um, I guess so. I just didn’t expect to hear it from Kuhouin-san and was surprised. Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I tried to laugh it off, but Kuhouin-san’s gaze felt somewhat cold.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I just happened to be in contact with Nishiki.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh, you two seem close. I had no idea.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I think to myself how insincere my acting must seem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had long known that he was making morning calls to wake up Kuhouin-san.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a way, both Kuhouin-san and I are in similar positions, being helped by him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ah, this isn’t good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I find myself feeling jealous of my student again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m probably a little upset that he relied on someone other than me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, are you two dating?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before I knew it, such a question had slipped out of my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not really. Nishiki is just a bit meddlesome. This time, he just happened to ask me to pass on a message. Um, that’s all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin-san quickly ended the conversation and returned to her seat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I opened the attendance book and marked Yuunagi Nishiki as absent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even without writing it down, the absence of a student who’s always in front of me is really obvious and forces me to be aware of his absence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The familiar scene changes so much, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine. There’s no problem if it’s just between students.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I murmur in a voice no one can hear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though I’m also a part of the second-year Class C, I’m different from everyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Teacher and student. Adult and child. These obvious distinctions make me feel a little lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Leaving the classroom and walking down the hallway, I can’t help but think about him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If he’s caught a cold, he should have told me directly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I become increasingly irritated, putting my own behavior aside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a selfish thought. After sending him home like that yesterday, it’s impossible to expect a message.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wouldn’t be able to do it if our roles were reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fact that he asked Kuhouin-san to relay a message clearly shows he feels awkward about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if he’s managing his food and medicine…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In times like this, living alone is tough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without someone to take care of you, you have to move yourself even when you’re feeling awful. Otherwise, nothing gets done.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;That’s what the Neighbor Agreement is for, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I decided to do what needs to be done.</p>
