<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several weeks had passed since the armed Goblins’ attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued taking requests and improving his rank: at present, he was a rank D adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was now riding the carriage he received in the Aferre village, on a request to transport supplies. He also helped in the reconstruction of the villages ravaged by the Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve brought food supplies!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh, finally!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Break time, everybody! Stop working!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wolf carriage had arrived at a large village located dozens of kilometers from the Adventure City Lunot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the village was attacked by the armed Goblins, the fences surrounding the village were destroyed; the Barrier and Decay stones were damaged as well.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-86704172' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-86704172' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survivors returned to the village, little by little, and the reconstruction was proceeding at a very high pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How is the process going?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, the pace is stable, I guess. We should be back to normal in two weeks or so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We sorely need manpower, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While unloading the supplies from the carriage, Reito asked the villagers about the reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people had been killed by the Goblins, but most houses were intact. The armed Goblins’ objective was gathering food supplies and tools, so they did not cause extensive damage to the buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way&#8230;we’ve got some broken shovels. I’m sorry to ask again, but could you fix it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No problem, where is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m really sorry to ask you to help so many times&#8230;hey, bring the stuff!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yessir!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A villager brought several broken farming tools and Reito quickly fixed them with his Alchemy skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his shovel, as good as new, the man cheered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amazing!! And I thought I needed a new one!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t fix the wooden parts, so please be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could we ask you to dig a hole here? We want to bury trash, but it’ll take time to dig it ourselves&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;Earth Block.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, amazing!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could easily make earthen walls to protect the village as well, but he didn’t want to stand out too much, so he quickly left after performing such simple tasks for the villagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, I have to go now&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks as always, friend!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please come again!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito waved back at the villagers, then headed back to Lunot with Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had been a while since Reito started visiting human settlements, after his life in the forest: he had befriended all sorts of people and managed to lead a relatively normal life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You seem like you’re enjoying yourself, Reito.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Whoa, don’t talk me out of the blue like that! You really surprised me&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the wolf carriage was running across the plains, time suddenly stopped for Reito. Airis’ voice resounded in his head, even though he had not called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The communication with Airis only happened when Reito called her first before, but recently Airis sometimes initiated the communication from her side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the wavelength of their souls was growing gradually closer, so such a thing became possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, I advise against going down that road. You’ll be ambushed by bandits.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Bandits?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The convoys carrying supplies from the Adventure City to the villages are being attacked fairly often. The convoys have to be guarded by soldiers or adventurers recently.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Right, the receptionist said something like that too&#8230;』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-33292354' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-33292354' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You can probably defeat them, but I don’t think it wise to stick your neck into trouble. Look, your dear cousin just happens to be in the area. You should report to her about the bandits.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『My dear cousin&#8230;Nao?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took Airis’ advice and made a detour towards the village of Faas, where Nao happened to be at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he arrived at the village, he found the Valkyrja knights were there too, so he called to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? That’s&#8230;Princess Nao, it’s Reito.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? Reito!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knights were having a meal, monster meat grilled on a large iron plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the knights noticed Reito’s arrival and told Nao about it: the princess, still chewing meat, ran up to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“..chew&#8230;gulp&#8230;it’s been a while! We met in Lunot last time&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Princess, you should talk after properly chewing and swallowing..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-right&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito smiled wryly at Nao’s enthusiasm, as her knights rushed to her and offered advice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and her Valkyrja knights had been stationed in Lunot for several weeks: the king had ordered them to track the movements of the pro-empire faction. In order to do so, the Valkyrjas had been visiting the villages attacked by the armed Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are things going lately?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are hunting down thieves day after day, as you can see. We have more chances to fight against humans than against monsters&#8230;which, I have to confess we have mixed feelings about&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the knights continued after Nao’s apologetic words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to the Princess’ efforts, however, the safety of the area has improved. The Black Tigers’ guildmaster too expressed her gratitude for the decrease in bandit activities&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is true, but&#8230;not being able to focus on our original mission has me concerned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valkyrja knights were currently patrolling the villages under reconstruction, finding and eliminating any bandits and thieves attacking the supply convoys. They had already captured more than 50 thieves, but Nao and her knights were vexed with such vultures hovering around the villagers’ plight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao seemed to recall something and spoke again.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, Reito, I heard you were promoted to rank D. That’s an impressive feat! Only 11 other adventurers could reach such a rank in such a short time at your age!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So I’m the 12th…? I’m not sure if I should be happy or not&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the first time for a so-called ‘hopeless’ job holder to rise over F rank, though. Some even doubt you really are a hopeless job holder&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing I can do about that&#8230;ah, do you want to see my guild card?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, gladly&#8230;hmm, Support Magician and Alchemist&#8230;by the way, Reito, why do you use a broadsword, if you’re a Magician? It doesn’t seem very fitting&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I’ve trained to use it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure that’s a weapon you can handle with just training&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to change the awkward topic, Reito asked about the bandits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, er&#8230;by the way, I spotted a group of bandits on the way here, so I wanted to report them&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? You should have said that sooner! Where did you see them? Did they do anything to you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao immediately stopped eating, asked Reito about the bandits’ whereabouts and decided to dispatch a group of knights to deal with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, the Valkyrja knights were at present composed of over 100 members, all powerful warriors over level 50.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We shall handle the inspection here then, Princess Nao.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll do our best!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao entrusted the inspection of the Faas village to the black-haired knight and young Beastman knight Reito had talked to previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao was going to lead the other knights to catch the bandits. Before she left, she recalled something and turned towards Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, I might as well tell you. You’ve probably heard of it, but the Hunting Festival will be held soon. Because of the pro-empire faction and the armed Goblins’ attacks, it was delayed two weeks, but&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hunting Festival…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis quickly intervened to explain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It is a festival for adventurers, held in Lunot. Monsters are let loose in the city, and adventurers compete by taking down as many of them as possible within a set time. The adventurer who defeated most monsters receives an award, and the guild they belong to also receives greater funding from the kingdom.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled that Bal had told him about the festival too. He wasn’t very interested, so he had forgotten about it already.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-81235559' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-81235559' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Hunting Festival is an important event, which visitors come to see from all over the world. Because of the pro-empire faction events, however, they couldn’t gather enough monsters. If you can catch monsters, when you’re out on requests or other business, and bring them to monster merchants, you’ll be rewarded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are monster merchants?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People that trade monsters for humans to keep. In Adventure City, there’s a large building in the northern part of town that serves as a monster trading post. If you bring monsters there at this time, you should be able to sell them at a high price. If you wish to become a first-class adventurer, you will need proper equipment, won’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao smiled wryly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not wearing any defensive gear and only used a broadsword not made of magic metal. Nao was thus worried that he hadn’t acquired any proper gear yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let us depart, my knights!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Princess!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s white horse galloped out of the village, with the other Valkyrja knights in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then returned to his wolf carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His finances were not dire at all: on the contrary, he had accumulated quite a bit of money from requests and helping people. There was another reason why he had not bought any equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he wore bulky gear, it would get in the way when he fought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his life in the Abyssal Forest, Reito had fought satisfactorily even without proper gear, dodging or parrying the monsters’ attacks with his physical skills. He had learned several defensive skills, but never used armor or the like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Defense, huh&#8230;now that I think about it, Bal used a skill called Harden&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Harden is not a skill regular humans can learn. It is exclusive to Giants, normally.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Does that mean that Bal is a Giant?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『No, but she has Giant blood in her veins. There are ways to boost your defenses other than Harden, though.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito listened to Airis’ advice as Ullr pulled the carriage back to Adventure City.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito went to the adventurers’ guild, reported the completed request, then headed to the training grounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the guilds’ adventurers were busy with requests of transporting supplies to the various villages: the training grounds thus were often empty, and that day was no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;I feel I’m getting used to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You are more familiar with that Combination Battle Art, I see.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, don’t talk suddenly when I’m training&#8230;anyway, it sure has a long name&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see, let us call it Stark Blade then.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t decide that on your own&#8230;I guess that works, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had tried combining Strike Blade with various other Battle Arts, thus acquiring many Combination Battle Arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword skills based on Strike Blade had a heavy burden on the body, but their offensive power was equally high. Reito couldn’t use them without activating Muscle Boost first, but his enhanced physique was strong enough to deal with the additional stress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, with enough training he would one day be able to use these techniques  without boosting his physical abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Muscle Boost&#8230;haah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the physical boost skill and swung his sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had defeated powerful opponents such as Basil and Gain and acquired considerable experience in fighting humans: thanks to that, he had become more confident in his sword skills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued swinging his broadsword, putting all of his strength into each swing.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-59327578' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-59327578' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;it’s getting tough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’re really working hard, aren’t you. But honestly, aren’t you forgetting that you’re a Magician? I’ve never heard of magic users fighting with swords.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I could swear you just told me to train my body more, though. Anyway, you’re right&#8230;magic&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could use basic grade magic spells to attack, but he wanted to use magic only when fighting against monsters: it could easily become lethal against humans, and Reito did not want to kill people, even if he was against criminals such as bandits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could go all out with magic against monsters, but he wanted to use it only as support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that, he had been focusing on training with the broadsword recently.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did not use Iceclad Sword much anymore, despite relying on it often in the Abyssal Forest. Instead, he used Heavy Strike and its gravity manipulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Gravity manipulation magic consumes a lot of magic power, so please be careful. Also, please keep in mind that while Magic Power Boost increases the effects of magic, it also increased magic power consumption tremendously.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, got it. Oh, it’s time to feed Ullr&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, here you are. Sir Reito!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Reito could go to feed his partner, the guild receptionist ran up to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Reito’s surprise, she grabbed his arm, agitated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-we’re in trouble!! People from another guild suddenly came in, demanding to meet the guildmaster and you!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Who exactly are those people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The guildmaster of Hailstorm, the largest guild in Lunot!! Please come quickly!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was thus dragged to the front of the guild by the unexpectedly vigorous receptionist and told to go to the guest room, where the guildmaster was already waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist was about to open the door for Reito, when Bal’s shouting voice leaked out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sure know how to get on people’s nerves, you vixen!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As testy as always&#8230;sit down and be quiet, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist timidly knocked on the door and Bal barked back an irritated, “Come in!!”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-excuse me!! I have brought Sir Reito&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch&#8230;there was no need to&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, so this is the rumored disciple you have recently taken under your wings?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was shown inside, and found Bal, sitting with her feet on the desk, visibly irritated, and a beautiful blonde woman sitting across from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Reito laid eyes on the woman, he froze. She was the spitting image of his mother, Aira.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh&#8230;mother?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words escaped Reito’s lips and were met by a frown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman seemed not to comprehend: Reito then realized she was not really his mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first place, she was an Elf, while Reito’s mother was human. They looked so similar, however, that Reito couldn’t hide his confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal interjected sharply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you saying? This woman doesn’t have any kids&#8230;at least, not that I know of?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you start with me, Bal&#8230;hmm, what a curious boy. Do your mother and I look so much alike…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah!! If you’re upset about it, you’re welcome to go home already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t change the topic, please. This is important for you too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ehm&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have a seat, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito promptly obeyed, as if he was being scolded by his mother. Bal clearly found the woman utterly troublesome to deal with, but the latter simply sipped her tea, unperturbed.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-72838158' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-72838158' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;a rather cheap brand. Is this what you serve to your guests?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, you should be grateful you got served at all&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me, why have I been called here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito interjected in the conversation and the two women turned towards him. Bal scratched her head and introduced the woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s Maria&#8230;the master of one of our rival guilds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rival? Oh, please. After all the requests we let your little guild take from us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you start with me now!! You only give us the requests you don’t want to take&#8230;and you just snatched another B rank adventurer from our guild, didn’t you!? How many times does this make!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my. First class adventurers seek first class environments, I believe that is how the world works. Haven’t you traveled from guild to guild yourself when you were young?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Moreover, I have simply made an offer. I have not “snatched” anyone against their will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman named Maria put Bal’s protests to rest. Bal wasn’t satisfied yet, but could not find fault in her arguments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief pause, she spoke up again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bah&#8230;you’re always chasing after our adventurers, anyway. Dozens of them, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Indeed, I believe the most recent one was the 30th&#8230;and now your guild does not have a single A or B rank adventurer. I wonder if you can still call it an adventurers’ guild, to be frank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah, you’ll see&#8230;even if the ranks are lower, we have plenty of talent here. Like him, for example.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal lightly slapped Reito’s back and Maria observed him silently, then her eyes opened wide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;how surprising. I’ve heard the rumors, but&#8230;he really is a hopeless job holder.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Watch out, kid&#8230;she’s got an Unique Skill called Appraisal Eye. The difference with Appraisal is that she can see people’s status in the blink of an eye.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bal, Maria possessed a special ability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a single look, she could see a person’s status, name, age, jobs etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Number of acquired skills&#8230;impressive, I’ve never seen a human with so many. And you’re still fourteen&#8230;how nice. I’ll take this boy too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t you dare!! I’m not giving you anything, get lost already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suppose it can’t be helped&#8230;I’ll give up for now. Just in case, have one of these.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria stood up from her seat, then gave Reito a crystal ball engraved with snowflake-like patterns. Reito took it, curious, and she smiled and whispered next to his ear.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you wish to see me, come to the guild with this&#8230;you will always be welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I shall excuse myself, then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, excuse yourself, and fast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria thus left the guest room. Reito looked at the crystal ball she gave him. He didn’t know if it was a Magic Stone, but could not feel any special power from it. It glowed with a beautiful light, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hand that over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah— ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal grabbed the crystal ball from Reito’s hands, then started squeezing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her muscles swelled, veins popping out on the surface, to the point they resembled an Ogre’s more than a human’s: the crystal ball quickly shattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal took out a marble-sized colorless crystal from the pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch&#8230;another one of her dirty pranks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ehm&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a Mana Absorber, a type of Magic Stone. Like the name says, it sucks in the holder’s magic power&#8230;that woman always pulls cheap pranks like this on people that won’t join her side. Don’t just accept what people give you without thinking, boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I’m going to take this, if you don’t mind. It’s also a Magic Stone, which should be enough to cover today’s bar tab.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal, with Magic Stone in hand, left while humming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, left alone, sighed, then remembered he had to go feed Ullr and quickly went back to his partner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria climbed aboard the horse carriage she had waiting near the guild and thought about the boy she just met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that he called her “Mother” intrigued her. She also had the feeling she had seen him somewhere before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could we have met before? I don’t think so, but&#8230;I wonder why&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady, is anything the matter?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Shinobi, you were here?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-18133021' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-18133021' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria was supposed to be alone in the carriage cabin, but out of the blue a man’s voice called her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradually, the silhouette of a man became visible: the man called “Shinobi” had blended in the background. He was dressed exactly like a typical Japanese ninja.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His face was mostly covered by a mask, but the visible features suggested he was quite handsome, though on the neutral side. He was one of the Hailstorm adventurers Maria trusted the most, and was allowed to guard her in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did the meeting go, Milady?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The usual. She has no intention of coming back, apparently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What shall we do, then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;keep giving her work, as usual. But don’t let her find out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Acknowledged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria acted confidently with Bal, but now her expression was rather weary. She ordered Shinobi to pass requests received by her guild to Bal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal had not fully realized yet that more than half of the requests delivered to the Black Tigers guild were initially brought to Hailstorm. Maria consistently harvested able adventurers from the Black Tigers, but gave them jobs in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;will Lady Bal truly never return?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will make her. No matter what methods I have to use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria was extremely attached to Bal, who had “dared” leave her side. At the same time, however, she also felt very lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, I sound like a mother who can’t bear separating from her children&#8230;hm&#8230;mother…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No&#8230;Shinobi, there is someone I wish to know more about. Can I leave it to you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An adventurer, Milady?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, the Black Tigers adventurer in the rumors lately&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Acknowledged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria glanced at the horse carriage’s window. The entrance to the Black Tigers guild was quickly growing smaller and more distant, but she could see a boy feeding dried meat to a large wolf in front of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria found herself thinking about her sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;sister&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria then took out her locket and opened it. The photo inside portrayed Maria as a child, together with her older sister and their now deceased father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I will find you, no matter what&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria pressed her fingers against her temples, then realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy she had just met had features reminiscent of her older sister’s childhood appearance—</span></p>
