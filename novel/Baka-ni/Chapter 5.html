<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5: First, Try Opening Up Your Heart</h1>

<p class="calibre4">When I woke up in the morning, I clearly felt sick.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t have a thermometer, but I felt discomfort all over my body, and it was a struggle to even get up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I went to hydrate myself from the fridge, only to realize that I had left the groceries I bought last night in Tenjō-san’s room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This realization completely broke my spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have to admit it. I’ve caught a cold.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After quenching my thirst, I returned to bed, and then the phone rang.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hello?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Wow, there it is.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">A ridiculous voice came from the other end of the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akira?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t expect a call from Akira.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Are you up properly?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, is it that time already…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Looking at the clock in my room, it was long past the usual time I make calls.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『No morning call today. That’s rare, did you oversleep?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can wake up on my own now, so I’m no longer needed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『This morning was just by chance. I was going to complain to Nishiki for skipping the call.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My bad.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…Nishiki? You sound odd. Are you feeling unwell?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It seems like I’ve caught a cold. It’s a little severe, so I’m skipping school today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I definitely can’t go to school in this condition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be terrible if I pushed myself and ended up passing the cold to Sensei who stands in front of me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, but can you tell Tenjō-sensei that I won’t be coming today?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel bad asking Akira, but she’s the only one I can rely on right now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Got it.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That helps.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel relieved that she agreed so easily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s hard for me to send such a message to Tenjō-san right after yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The timing is so bad, it might seem like a blatant nuisance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I really feel sorry about that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『But, are you really okay?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re so nice today. I wish you were always like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Don’t talk nonsense and rest properly. Do your parents already know?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I live alone, so it doesn’t concern them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Oh, really…』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira suddenly goes silent.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akira?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Should I come and take care of you?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought I misheard her because of the fever.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akira…you’re actually a good person huh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『At the very least, I worry about you if you’re sick.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A cold will heal if I just sleep. Don’t worry about me, and don’t be late for school.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『If something serious happens, I’ll bring you something』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just your concern is enough. Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Exhausted from talking, I immediately fell asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I fell asleep, went to the bathroom, rehydrated, and went back to sleep several times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even after waking up, the fatigue from the fever didn’t go away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My sleep was shallow, and I couldn’t clearly tell if I was awake or asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, I know it’s a dream when a person who shouldn’t be here appears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And it was about an event from the past that can no longer be changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how much I try to forget, it’s impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s the very reason why I became alone and chose to live by myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The adorable girl who was supposed to become my family through our parents’ remarriage pleaded while crying in my arms.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『I don’t want to be siblings with Yuu-kun.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">The boy and the girl who are not related by blood were supposed to become a brother and sister under one roof.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But my stepsister, whom I met after becoming a family, wished to remain strangers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How happy I would have been if she could respond to my sincere feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was a beautiful girl by anyone’s standards, and of course, I loved her too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since she was important to me, it was natural to help her if she was in trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At least, that’s what I thought.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The affection my stepsister held for me was different from my familial love; it was closer to romantic love.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Knowing her feelings, I couldn’t stay with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would also cause trouble for my mother, who had finally found happiness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s why I distanced myself from my family.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Waking from the dream, I looked at the ceiling of my own room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fever still hadn’t subsided.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ever since I decided to live alone, I thought I had been careful with my health.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In times like this when I’m sick, I deeply feel the loneliness of being alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sense of solitude becomes overwhelming, weighing heavily on my weakened body and mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“………”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I reach for the plastic bottle I had placed by my pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since I didn’t have any stock, I managed to go out at noon when I woke up and bought only a sports drink from a nearby vending machine.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There isn’t much left in the fridge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lacking the energy to even stand in the kitchen, I’ve been getting by on just drinks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The bottle, which I thought I had held, fell to the floor with a light ‘thud’ sound.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Apparently, I had forgotten that I had already finished it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Here, there’s no one to bring me a drink even if I shout out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t have the energy to go to the fridge and get a new drink.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reluctantly, I try to force myself back to sleep by closing my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you thirsty? I’ll give you something to drink.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I heard a hallucination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the voice of a woman who couldn’t possibly be here.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can you open your mouth? Yes, I’ll tilt the bottle.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I obeyed the instructions, a cold liquid slowly flowed into my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sensation of moisture spreading through my body was comforting.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you want more?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a moist throat, I answer ‘I’m fine’ to the questioning voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s good. Let me know if you want more, Yuunagi-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…uh, Sensei?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After blinking a few times, the face of Reiyu Tenjō was close by.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My sense of time was vague after spending the whole day in bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The light spilling through the gap in the curtains indicated it was still early in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At this time on a weekday, Reiyu Tenjō shouldn’t be in my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, this means──</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Still a dream…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s reality. How are you feeling? How high is your fever? Where’s your thermometer?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was lively. Her manner of speaking was just like Tenjō-sensei when she was talking seriously at school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It felt strangely unreal because of that.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I don’t have a thermometer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I answered as she asked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, let me check your temperature.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She said while placing her hand on my forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her cold palm felt nice and brought clarity to my fever-clouded consciousness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh, you’re real…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was Tenjō-san kneeling beside my bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t strain yourself to talk since you have a fever.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shouldn’t you be at school right now?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She should usually be teaching the swim team right now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I passed on the training menu to the club and asked another Sensei to take over.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But how did you get into my room?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The door was unlocked, so I let myself in, sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san calmly answered as if it were nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, I must have forgotten to lock it when I came back from the vending machine at noon.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why did you come here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was worried about you, so I came to take care of you. That’s all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I would feel too awkward to come if I were you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My fever made me blurt out exactly what I was thinking.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The second clause of the ‘Neighbor Agreement’ states, ‘In times of trouble, we help each other without hesitation.’ That’s what we agreed on.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san stated matter-of-factly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I thought it would be nullified because of what I did.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s impossible. Without you, it’s me who will end up dying.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s an exaggeration.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I tried to laugh off Tenjō-san’s joke, but it didn’t work.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She gently fixed the shifted blanket for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, with a sincere voice, she confessed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if the ‘Neighbor Agreement’ was nullified for both of us, I could still live on my own. I think it’s the same for you. But you see, I’m definitely happier now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not just superficial things like having someone to cook meals for you or having more free time. It’s realizing that having someone to worry about, even on busy days, isn’t so bad after all. That’s something I learned from you, my neighbor. So, don’t think of it as a bother, and rely on me, Yuunagi-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san. Sorry for catching a cold. I hope you can help me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I admitted my weakness in front of her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s nothing to apologize for. Besides, I’m the one who should apologize for yesterday! Can you forgive me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, who rushed to my aid when I was weak looks like a goddess to me. I think I’ve fallen for you all over again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay, let’s consider yesterday’s matter settled! The sick person should rest!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san spoke rapidly, then stood up from beside the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I put the groceries you forgot yesterday in the fridge. Also, I’ll use the kitchen to make something to eat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just relax and let yourself be pampered for once.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her adult demeanor was not intrusive and forceful but natural.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry, just rest. I’ll wake you when the meal is ready, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. I’m hungry since I’ve only had drinks since this morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is rice porridge okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I do have an appetite, so something more filling like udon would be nice.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I conveyed what I wanted to eat right now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay. I’ll make it right away.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san smiled and headed to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sense of security from having someone in the house made me feel relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sounds of cooking from the kitchen were strangely comforting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of water running and the rhythmic chopping of the knife served as background music, and I closed my eyes peacefully.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was good at cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she said herself, she didn’t have time for household chores because of her busy schedule, but she was skilled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The udon, generously filled with ingredients, had noodles boiled soft for easy eating, and the broth was rich in the essence of the ingredients and dashi(stock), giving it a gentle taste.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I had sweated quite a bit while sleeping, the saltiness of the dish felt delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How’s the taste?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s delicious.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s good. I won’t be at ease until you get better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san’s cooking has brought me back to life.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I ate eagerly and was able to have a meal that filled me up completely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the meal, I took some cold medicine and felt much better.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You must have sweated again after eating. Should I prepare a warm towel?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel a bit better, so I’m just going to take a shower.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Won’t you collapse in the bathroom?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I won’t soak in the tub, so it’s fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thanks to Tenjō-san, my vision was clearer than in the afternoon, and I was able to walk straight.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can you wash yourself, or do you need help?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not a child, please don’t worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Still, wait a moment!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Saying that, Tenjō-san hurriedly returned to her own room for some reason.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Although the meal had somewhat revived me, I wanted to quickly shower off the sweat and go to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thinking there was no need to wait just to take a shower, I entered the bathroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The warm water felt comforting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I stood there blankly under the shower, the bathroom gradually filled with white steam.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I heard the bathroom door open with a click.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Assuming it was a mishearing due to my feverish state, I ignored it and was about to start washing myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, you’re already in. I told you to wait.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, Tenjō-san!? Why are you opening the door!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turned around in surprise and saw her standing there wrapped in a towel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was completely frozen.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll wash your back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was calm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her long hair was tied back to keep it from getting wet, and she was wearing a bath towel wrapped around her from the chest down. She also held a small towel in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Though only her shoulders and collarbone were exposed, it was almost the same as being naked to a teenage boy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehh!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I let out a loud voice despite feeling too weak to raise my voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Think of it as an apology for yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The meal was more than enough!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I still feel sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ignoring my agitation, she entered the bathroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please, just leave already!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be shy just because you’re not feeling well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s still not okay even if I didn’t have a cold!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s not okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san tilts her head in confusion.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just inappropriate, that’s what!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Unable to face her, I turn my back, pressing myself against the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s inappropriate about it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The way you’re not dressed!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t notice her approaching, drowned out by the sound of the shower.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Even though I’m not naked?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her whisper right behind my ear feels like a sweet temptation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I involuntarily swallow hard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A shiver runs down my spine as if electricity is coursing through it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My rational restraint felt like it was about to break at any moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In that moment of silence, mixed with anticipation and confusion, she seemed to take it as a ‘Yes’.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I want you to get better, so this is special just for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, stop!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turn around abruptly to stop her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ta-daa!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then she energetically removed the bath towel she was wearing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…A swimsuit?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Underneath wasn’t a completely bare figure──but a swimsuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was wearing a competitive swimsuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I recognized the design of the swimsuit. It was the one hanging in the bathroom during the G incident.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Regaining my composure, I ended up looking at it properly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The straps over the shoulders should have been visible over the bath towel on closer inspection, but I was in a hurry and didn’t notice them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I’m going to get wet, a swimsuit is the only choice, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not good!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The visual impact was so strong it felt like it could blow away my fever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She seemed to have chosen it purely for the purpose of helping me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, the assertiveness of Reiyu Tenjō knew no bounds.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t raise your voice too much, you’re still not well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s because someone’s wearing something too stimulating.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A swimsuit is just a swimsuit. It’s not naked, so it’s safe.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The swim team advisor confidently and unreservedly displayed her beautiful swimsuit figure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Accustomed to wearing it regularly and confident in her physique, she seemed to have little embarrassment about this appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But for a high school boy, a swimsuit appearance was almost the same as being naked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, the competitive swimsuit that was designed for functionality fits snugly and highlights her body’s contours.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The steamy heat of the bathroom reddened her cheeks, the sweat glistening on her chest cascading down her cleavage, and her high-cut legs were exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her entire appearance was too sexy, and I didn’t know where to look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But my eyes were involuntarily drawn to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knew she had a good figure even under her clothes, but I never imagined it to be this much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I am left speechless as I stare at her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The sound of the shower was the only thing echoing in the bathroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, you’re staring too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“!? S-Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turn my face away, remembering that I am completely naked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, due to a physiological reaction, I realized that a certain part of my body was in an emergency situation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a panic, I sit on the bath chair and curl up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san says, “Then I’ll wash you like that. Shall we start with shampoo?” and begins to help.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I realize that she won’t leave until she has completed what she came to do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lacking the energy to resist, I resign myself and try to stay quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san kneels behind me and starts washing my hair and lathering it up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way she massages my scalp honestly feels good.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is there anywhere itchy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s so nice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your voice sounds tense.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you angry? I just want you to feel refreshed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is a trial for me, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Heaven and hell seem to have joined forces against me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This situation is far more difficult than when I was on top of her in bed last night, she, taking advantage of my weakened state, was surprisingly calm and composed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m honestly having a bit of fun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My agitation seems amusing to her; because Tenjō-san’s reflection in the mirror has a mischievous look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s unfair that you’re the only one enjoying this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You make it sound like I’m bullying you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This feels like a torture for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ahaha. Let’s rinse off your head and freshen up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Unaware of how I feel, she laughs it off and rinses off the lather with the shower.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wipe the water off my face and push back my hair, then honestly convey my impression of the current situation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just to let you know, a swimsuit can be even more er*tic than being naked.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun, are you into swimsuits!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, that’s not it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can see swimsuits at the beach or the pool all the time. It would be difficult if you reacted to every single one of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true, but you’re underestimating men’s reactions a bit too conveniently.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While talking, Tenjō-san applies body soap to a towel and starts washing my back, extending from my shoulders down to my arms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, at my collarbone, her hand abruptly stops.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, but can you wash the front yourself, please?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d rather you never look at me from the front at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why not?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her return question revealed her innocence exploding in full force.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right now, I absolutely can’t hide the fact that I am a man.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh?──What!? Even though you have a cold?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Was she too off guard because I had a cold!?</p>
<p class="calibre4">No wonder she could carelessly come into the bathroom wearing a swimsuit. (TN: Using duck again.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it selfless goodwill or boldness due to ignorance?</p>
<p class="calibre4">This person has completely forgotten.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter if it’s teacher and student──the fact that we are a man and a woman cannot be changed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to Sensei’s visit, I’ve become energized and much better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before receiving the towel, I grab Tenjō-san’s wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pull her close and clearly warn her near my face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I weren’t sick, I definitely wouldn’t be able to hold back.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“W-whoa, you have the eyes of a wild beast.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s because Sensei is so attractive.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m older than you, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Age doesn’t matter. Just be prepared for when the time comes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I convey this just to get back at her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Finally realizing her carelessness, Tenjō-san’s face turns red.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think I will never forget the expression on Reiyu Tenjō’s face at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The once playful Tenjō-san is now tinged with embarrassment, her face showing awareness that there could be something more between a man and a woman ahead.</p>

<p class="calibre4">A confined space, a man and a woman nearly naked, close proximity.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We are just barely holding on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I’m getting hot, so I’ll go out first.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She stands up and rushes out of the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After leaving the bathroom, I change into new pajamas and return to the room where Tenjō-san is still there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had changed into the loungewear I had seen before and was sitting cross-legged on the carpet, hugging her knees as if to protect herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No what, did Tenjō-san change here? Did she get naked in my living space?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">No good, after seeing her in a swimsuit in the bathroom, my imagination about her nudity has become vividly enhanced.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m getting a lot of bad fantasies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s extremely awkward after that bath.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did you feel refreshed? Or are you still feeling ill? Make sure you hydrate properly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san tentatively speaks up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m surprised you didn’t run away.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;I can’t just leave a sick person alone and go home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her statement sounded somewhat stubborn.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to you. I guess the medicine must have worked; I feel a lot better now. Thank you very much.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I discover an unfamiliar storage container as I open the fridge to quench my thirst with a sports drink.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s large and filled to the brim. The contents are brown.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did Tenjō-san put this in here?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s Nikujaga. I made it, so I brought it just in case.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She admits it bashfully.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Tenjō-san, you’ve been looking for a chance to make up since yesterday, haven’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just kept the promise we made at the supermarket!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, I’ll eat it right away, Itadakimasu.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I open the lid and pick up a piece with my fingers.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wow, the flavor is soaked in and it’s delicious. Tenjō-san, you’re really good at cooking, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t be rude! The sick person should quickly go to bed to avoid catching another cold.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She emphatically pats the bed, urging me to sleep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll save the rest for tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have a good appetite and your complexion looks better, so you’ll probably recover by tomorrow. But just in case, you should take another day off from school. Understand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll do that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The room lights are turned off, leaving only the indirect lighting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san stands to watch like a guardian deity until I get into bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Uh, Tenjō-san. It’s Monday, you can go home now because I’m okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s still before nine, so I have more time than usual. I’ll go back if I’m disturbing your sleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I slept too much during the day, so it doesn’t bother me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, I’ll stay a little longer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She also sits on the floor, leaning against the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Turning to the side, Reiyu Tenjō’s beautiful face was close to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re this close, you might catch my cold.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe getting others sick helps you recover faster.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s pointless if Sensei gets sick.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true, but we were much closer earlier.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san muttered as if talking to herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A woman’s casual response and innocent approach can be a deadly weapon to a man. It’s easy to fall for her, and one might get carried away with misunderstandings. Especially if it’s someone you’re interested in.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I look up at the ceiling.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Hey, Yuunagi-kun, what kind of person are you interested in?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san asked with a cautious voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The working adult next door. She’s so earnest, I just can’t leave her alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have unusual tastes, liking someone older.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was a slight tremble in Tenjō-san’s voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not really, the person I’m interested in just happened to be older.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wouldn’t it be easier to date someone your own age?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;And on top of that, she’s someone society generally says I shouldn’t be in a romantic relationship with.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That might be a waste of time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay. She’s important enough for me to be content with things as they are. I can wait until she gives me the okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if it seems irrational from an outsider’s perspective, it’s the right choice for me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I chose this of my own will.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The courage not to move forward, the resolution not to back down, and the patience not to rush.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want to cherish the current distance I have with the person next to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san. I want to add a rule to the Neighbor Agreement.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sit up and bring up something I’ve been thinking about for a long time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What kind of thing?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I turn my face to her, she waits for my next words with a tense expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I want to set an expiration date.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“When would that be?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asks cautiously.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Until I graduate.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? But that’s…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Reiyu Tenjō-san. Please don’t move away. I want you to continue being my neighbor.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I reveal my true feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s nothing special. I too like our current relationship just as it is.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t want to let go of the time I share with this person.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I would love to, but what if…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I understand that the current situation is dangerous for Tenjō-sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s about my convenience as a teacher, it’s not something you need to worry about.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But, my neighbor Onee-san told me, ‘If you’re in trouble, don’t hesitate to consult me. I will be there to help you.’ I’m someone who needs help like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I acknowledge my own weakness and become honest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I want to be considerate of Reiyu Tenjō’s circumstances as well.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The position as a teacher, the shared life as neighbors, and her personal feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Within a single person, these various aspects intertwine complexly, making it difficult to simply cut through and make a final decision.</p>

<p class="calibre4">──I, too, know all too well the difficulty of this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suppressing my personal feelings and being unable to abandon my role as a brother, I prioritized my family’s peace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, I distanced myself from my family and chose solitude.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of course I meant it, and that’s why I came today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Our secret between the two of us will be kept safe until graduation. Then, you don’t have to move, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The talk of moving was merely a precaution.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although being apart might be safer, it isn’t necessary.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">The talk of moving was merely a precaution.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although being apart might be safer, it isn’t necessary.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a pause, Tenjō-san murmurs softly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, does that mean you’re promising not to have a girlfriend until you graduate?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san doesn’t try to look at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instead, I take her hand that’s on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her slender hand trembles slightly but doesn’t pull away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll wait until graduation to prove my eternal love for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She lifts her face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re wasting your precious youth…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san looks like she’s about to cry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What I want the most is my youth with Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Won’t you regret it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Having time for yourself is the best part of being a student. So I, Yuunagi Nishiki, will spend my time on what I love the most.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She whispers softly, “Idiot.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, so you’ll strictly adhere to it as well, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s because the Neighbor Agreement is a rule shared by both of us.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. Sensei is beautiful and popular, so I’m worried. You must be getting a lot of attention from all kinds of guys.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I put on an overly exaggerated act. I can’t help but acknowledge my own poor acting skills.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That should be my line!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san retorts, getting worked up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you have anything to worry about?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She grips the hand she was holding tightly, almost painfully.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s a lot to worry about! I thought you were like me, lacking close friends around, but before I knew it, you became friendly with the cold beauty of the class, even having morning calls with her. Aren’t you too quick with girls? It makes me wonder if you’re a playboy. And to top it off, despite being sick, you ask her to pass a message for you. What are you doing!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She unleashes all her pent-up frustrations at once.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. So you came here half worried and half jealous.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No! It’s more like 80% worry and 20% jealousy!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her correction is oddly specific.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Wait, am I more important to her than I thought?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if it’s just 20%, coming all the way to the bathroom in a swimsuit means I’m quite liked, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I bite down on my back teeth, desperately trying to suppress the urge to grin.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t get cocky! I did it because it was necessary!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But that swimsuit was too er*tic. I wanted to touch your chest, and your butt was almost completely exposed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I frankly spill out a boy’s hidden desires.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t that too blunt!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san, who had been leaning against the bed, sat up and covered her chest with one arm.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Being lovers and cuddling naked would have been much easier to handle for me. That’s how nervous I was.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That much!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san realizes her own carelessness, looking as if she’s about to burst into flames from embarrassment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“As much as I want to cherish you, there are times I feel the impulse to pounce on you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This person is too unaware of a man’s heart and nature.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, I don’t let go of her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Maybe it’s like teasing a carnivore by dangling meat in front of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me tell you, even a prince on a white horse has s*xual desires.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Real love isn’t just about ideals and beautiful things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, that itself is probably the essence of what makes the deep relationship between people so special.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t think you’re a prince on a white horse!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mean to be that conceited. It’s not my style anyway.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but give a wry smile at her obvious attempt to hide her embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō, despite her elegant appearance, is truly a maiden at heart.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s not what I meant!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The woman I’m interested in is attractive even when she’s angry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not just her beauty that captivated me, nor is it her outstanding figure that makes me want to embrace her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Always, I wanted to see more of her expressions.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I teased you too much. To make Tenjō-san feel safe, I’ll do my best to resist any lewd thoughts.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, but it must be hard for boys to do that…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asks cautiously with her face turning red.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll resist as much as I can.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t see the difference.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can resist enough to share a bed without problems.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that, reassuring?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her skeptical gaze stings.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t stimulate me unnecessarily, probably.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Be more decisive like a man!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, I can’t meet your expectations.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you giving up too quickly!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A man’s s*xual desire is an uncontrollable monster.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…well, I can understand that, considering your reaction to the swimsuit. It must be tough to suppress physiological urges, so I’ll compromise as much as I can.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She expresses a bashful yet not entirely displeased look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What, she can make such a face?</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s too er*tically cute.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s dangerous, just looking at her gets me excited.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why is it that just at times like this, my health isn’t at its best?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you’re seriously a goddess. I won’t forget your words!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t get too excited, you’re sick! You have no self-control!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She scolds me but doesn’t let go of my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, you’re just too understanding and amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, maybe I shouldn’t have said that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s too late for regrets now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know. A woman doesn’t go back on her word.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She sighs as she reluctantly accepts, her conflicted look is also adorable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you’re hesitating, why not relax the conditions a little more?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Like what?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I propose the most peaceful solution.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Within the bounds of the law, why don’t we secretly have a wholesome relationship?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I gaze at her beautiful face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The once unattainable presence, too dazzling to even look up to, is now here beside me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The joy of this reality naturally brings a smile to my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She seems to feel the same. And then, unable to hold back any longer, she confesses.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No! If we do that, I won’t be able to control myself!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What? Does that mean…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just go to sleep already!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san finally shakes off my hand, but she doesn’t leave my side.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You always try to escape when you’re troubled.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but laugh. It’s just like the first time she shared her food with me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Challenged by my words, she stiffens in frustration.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, I’ll cancel the moving! Everything else is on hold! And no complaints allowed!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s the best medicine for me. Now I can sleep peacefully.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Relieved, I lie back down in bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll watch over you until you fall asleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s going to make me restless, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Just close your eyes, and you’ll eventually fall asleep. Don’t worry about me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Impossible or not, just bear with it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright, let’s see who can endure more. Goodnight.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Goodnight. Sweet dreams.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to sound tough, but I’m reaching my limits in so many ways.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With the comforting feeling of having the person I like close by, I quickly fell asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The following clause is added to the Neighbor Agreement between Yuunagi Nishiki and Reiyu Tenjō:</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Clause 6: Neither party shall have a romantic partner until graduation.】</p>
