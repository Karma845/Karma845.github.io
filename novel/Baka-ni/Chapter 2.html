<h3>Chapter 2</H3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days have passed since Reito’s arrival in the Adventure City Lunot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was now living in a lodging managed by the guild, reserved for low-rank adventurers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He planned to rent a room at an inn at first, but in that season, the city was visited by hordes of tourists, so he couldn’t find any vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for the influx of tourists was the upcoming Hunting Festival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the city’s adventurers’ guilds participated in the festival: selected adventurers from each guild would hunt down monsters released throughout the town, competing against each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guild that exterminated the most monsters would be crowned the winner and receive hefty financial aid from the kingdom. The adventurer with the highest score also received the right to be promoted to the next rank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only adventurers ranked C and above could participate in the festival however. Reito was therefore excluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunting Festival thus attracted crowds of tourists to the city: despite not being short on money, Reito was forced to stay in the guild’s lodgings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;drinking juice in the morning is the best!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was having breakfast in the guild’s tavern, taking it easy, without taking requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his years in the Abyssal Forest, he fought monsters almost every day: he could now lead a more “human” lifestyle, so he reveled in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing him laze about every day, however, Bal sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen here, boy&#8230;you came here and became an adventurer, how about putting in some work? Even if you got a large reward, you’re being way too lazy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, guildmaster&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal eventually lost her patience and put a piece of parchment on Reito’s table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, time to work!! I’ve got just the thing for a greenhorn!”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-58269307' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-58269307' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;collecting?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Bal placed on the table was one of the requests posted on the bulletin board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito checked the contents: the request involved picking Crescent Moon Grass, a type of medicinal herb he used to grow in the residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pick 30 tufts of Crescent Moon Grass&#8230;for three silver coins?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reward’s fair. You can find that herb anywhere, but gathering so much can be troublesome. You better get going after you finish eating, and don’t come back until you’re done!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal addressed Reito sternly, but he grinned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehe&#8230;you’re looking down on me, GM. I can complete a request like this in a snap.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GM…? No one’s ever called me like that&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took the request note and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal was relieved to see Reito was finally going to work, but for some reason, Reito did not head towards the exit&#8230;but towards the reception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me, I completed a request, can you confirm it for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, of course&#8230;oh, collection of medicinal herbs, I see. Please place the herbs on the counter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gave the request note to the receptionist, then opened his Storage subspace and took out 30 Crescent Moon Grass tufts he had picked up in his days in the Abyssal Forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here you go~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you very much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito passed next to Bal, standing there without a word, and returned to his seat. He then wiped the sweat from his forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;all in a day’s work.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Boy, are you trying to pick a fight with me!? If you had them from the start, just say it!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal was about to poke Reito’s head, so he crouched to dodge it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was fairly surprised to see him easily avoid an attack from behind, but then let out a deep sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly&#8230;why don’t you act a bit more seriously?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought seriously about it, actually. If I already have the items specified in the request, I just need to deliver them. What’s the problem?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing, but&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very well. I have some business to attend to, so if you’ll excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito finished drinking his juice, quickly bowed to the disappointed Bal, and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His destination was a wide space without people around: he planned to test the broadsword he made from the Troll’s weapon. He wouldn’t use the training grounds behind the guild because he didn’t want other people to see him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided to go to the alley where he encountered the thieves a few days before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This place should work. I can’t sense any human presence… okay, let’s start the experiment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito lifted the broadsword and swung it widely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was heavier than the broadswords he could create with Iceclad Sword, but he could wield it without particular trouble. After making sure of that, he tried using an Alchemist skill on the blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I recall correctly&#8230;tungsten carbide is supposed to be the hardest metal&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled the memories from his past life, then activated Metal Transmutation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metal forming the broadsword changed into carbide tungsten, a metal not naturally present in this world. Reito confirmed that the transmutation succeeded via the change in the metal’s color, then activated Matter Reinforcement to raise its durability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then&#8230;whoa, it’s too heavy&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword’s weight increased considerably because of Matter Reinforcement, but Reito could still handle it without too much trouble, thanks to the Tech Skill Might.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the process was finished, Reito put the sword back into the Storage subspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If kept outside, the skills’ effects would eventually run out, so he decided to take out the sword only when strictly necessary, as time stopped inside the Storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now I want to try hunting monsters with it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided to go outside the capital in order to test the capabilities of his new weapon. He was about to leave the alley when he heard a noise coming from the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The noise came from inside a wooden crate: it looked like there was a living creature inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s coming from there? Did a cat get in or something&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crate was big enough for a human to fit in. Reito, curious, lifted the lid and peeked inside — and found something very unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s in&#8230;eh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmgh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crate contained a young girl, her arms and legs tied with rope, her mouth gagged.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately lifted her out of the crate, untied her, and removed the gag: her clothes were dirty, but she did not have any visible wounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was wearing a bizarre attire, which looked like a one-piece, so Reito found it awkward to look at her. It might be problematic to stare at her like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was wondering what to do when the girl flashed a bright smile. It was hard to imagine that she was trapped in a crate until moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;thank you very much. I almost ended up shipped away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito kept greetings and introductions to a minimum, prioritizing taking the girl to a safer location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was curious about her circumstances but judged it risky to stay there. As they walked away, Reito asked her a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So&#8230;why were you tied up in that crate? Were you kidnapped…?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-83536127' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-83536127' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-packed…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl did not seem to know what happened either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had been stuck in the crate until Reito freed her apparently. She bowed politely and thanked him again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you so much for saving me. My name is&#8230;Kotomin. Can you tell me yours?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kotomin&#8230;my name’s Reito.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reito, that’s a nice name.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is Ullr, a very cute wolf, as you can see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr&#8230;you’re right, he’s really cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr barked and Kotomin smiled. Her gentle smile made Reito’s heart skip a beat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, barely managing to keep himself from staring too much. He shook his head and asked her a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More importantly, are you…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!! I found her!! The damn brat ran away!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Kotomin could reply, angry shouts reached their ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Kotomin turned around and saw a large man with tattoos engraved on his arms. He looked at Kotomin, his face twisted into an angry grimace, and drew the short sword at his waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch, did you really think you could run?? I’m going to sell you and live a normal life!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito raised his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the&#8230;run!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately jumped in front of the girl, to protect her, and the tattooed man shouted at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s my prey, brat!! Do you even know who she is!? This way, men!! Move it!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several men approached from the other end of the alley, following the tattooed man’s orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You found her!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re not getting away anymore!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s run!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito lifted Kotomin in his arms, then jumped on the roof of a nearby building, with Ullr in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The men hurriedly gave chase, but Reito, quickly leaping from roof to roof, was already far away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One more time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued jumping from roof to roof.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what’s that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A wolf!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the people in the streets below noticed them and yelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After moving far enough from the alley, Reito stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;we should be safe here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Reito whispered to himself, but Kotomin looked behind them and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be the case&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait up!! You damn brats!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man’s voice echoed in the surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito turned around and found a man with tiger ears and tail, jumping from roof to roof towards them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That guy’s&#8230;a Beastman!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooohhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The band of thieves apparently had a Beastman in their ranks: thanks to his physical abilities, vastly superior to average humans, he managed to catch up with Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beastman almost reached the roof they were standing on, but Reito waited for the right timing and calmly cast a magic spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind Pressure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before the Beastman could land on the roof, Reito blew a powerful gust of wind from his palm. Unable to defend himself mid-jump, the Beastman lost his balance and fell towards the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The townspeople gathered around the man fallen from the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what? This old guy just came falling down outta nowhere!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay, old man!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Say something, gramps!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commotion was getting louder and louder. Reito looked at the situation for a moment, then moved away, still carrying Kotomin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go while we can. I never expected someone to chase me on the roof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;it’s tough being popular&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr “sighed” at Kotomin’s joke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued leaping from roof to roof, moving to a taller building. A normal Leap didn’t bring him high enough, however, so he activated a magic spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice Block!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created an ice platform to use as a foothold and activated Leap again. It was the same method he used to escape the residence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the small group reached an isolated bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should be okay this time&#8230;get down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, but I’d like to jump around a bit more&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito let Kotomin down, who puffed her cheeks in a playful pout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to enjoy that kind of transportation, but Reito was nearing his limits: jumping from roof to roof while carrying someone was pretty taxing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito peeked at the river under the bridge and saw a great quantity of fish swimming around. The river seemed to be fairly deep.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-85413882' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-85413882' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a nice river&#8230;perfect for fishing, I bet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong, Ullr? Did you remember the first time we swam in a river?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr looked like he had something to say in response. Next to them, Kotomin was looking at the river — and drooling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks delicious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going for a swim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotomin stood on the edge of the bridge, leaned over, and dove down just like that. She entered the water with beautiful form, just like a professional swimmer, and proceeded underwater without a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could move at incredible speed underwater: soon enough, she jumped back out, in spectacular dolphin-like fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hop.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eeeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she jumped out of the water, a couple of fish were tossed from the river onto the bridge. They were exactly two; Kotomin, only her head poking out of the water, called to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s my thanks for today, please take them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You mean&#8230;the fish?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as he heard Kotomin’s words, Ullr pounced on one of the fish and started munching. Reito, still a bit confused, picked up the other one. Kotomin nodded, satisfied, then jumped out of the water and back on the bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A water spray doused both Reito and Ullr. In front of the speechless duo, Kotomin opened her arms wide, then embraced them both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You really saved me back there. Mmh~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotomin kissed Reito on the cheek, then did the same to Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all so sudden that Reito couldn’t react.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a content smile on her face, the young girl jumped back into the river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bye bye.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kotomin said just that and disappeared underwater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started looking for her immediately, but she was nowhere to be seen. Even Observing Eye could not locate her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His hands closed tighter on the fish she left&#8230;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito waited until his clothes dried, then returned to the empty lot in the alley. He made sure the men that chased them before were not around, then opened communication with Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis, why did they capture that girl anyway?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That young girl, yes? Aren’t you happy, to get to know such a pretty lady?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Stop that, tell me why she was captured.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, yes, master&#8230;the men who kidnapped her are thieves living in this city. Just petty criminals though.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The band of thieves, which made a living by kidnapping and selling their victims, was apparently still looking for them throughout the city. They had not expected Reito to return to the “crime scene”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Kidnappers, huh&#8230;so I should catch them and bring them to the guild, like last time?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『No, I believe in this case it is best to entrust them to the royal guards. Unlike criminals with bounties on their heads, you will not receive a reward, but they will definitely be sent to prison.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see, anyway I might as well catch them. I don’t want any trouble with the guards though&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It seems it won’t be necessary for you to act. That princess is visiting again.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Nao?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valkyrja knights were going to return to Lunot apparently. Their objective was to look for a certain very important person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis’ predictions, their future dictated that they would catch the band of kidnappers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Even if you don’t do anything, those thieves will be caught in the near future. I would suggest you leave it to them.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;got it.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito accepted Airis’ proposal and closed the communication, then headed out of the alley into the main road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, he suddenly detected a human presence in the alley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito turned around: there was no one around just moments before, but now he saw a hooded figure, carrying a large bag over their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly activated Stealth and Seal Presence to conceal himself.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-82016744' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-82016744' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hooded figure was short in stature, the size of a child. There also was the chance they belonged to the dwarven race though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued observing the figure from his hiding place. They carefully checked the surroundings, then…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Transfer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;.!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young girl’s voice echoed in the alley, followed by the formation of a magic circle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito watched in surprise as the magic circle, with the hooded figure in the center, started glowing, then emitted a blinding light for one second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reflexively covered his eyes: when the light faded, the hooded figure was no more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What the&#8230;Aegis!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You say it like it’s a skill name&#8230;anyway, that was a high-grade magic spell called a transfer magic circle. Even Magician job holders have to reach at least level 60 to learn it.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with Airis for the moment, then walked back into the alley and inspected the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had definitely seen the magic circle, but there was no trace of it left. Reito recalled the hooded figure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ice!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’re running out of ideas, aren’t you? Perfect opportunity to put a stop to the puns.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmph&#8230;tell me about that person instead.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a very unusual fashion, Airis did not start explaining immediately. Reito was going to ask again, but she spoke up first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I can tell you about that person, but there’s nothing you can do even if you know.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh? What do you mean by that?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That person is too dangerous to get involved with carelessly&#8230;is what I mean.』</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, if you say it like that&#8230;okay then.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was not exactly convinced but decided to forget about it for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He closed the communication with Airis, made sure no one was around, and returned to the reason why he had come to the alley in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated his Storage magic and took out his new broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t give it a name yet, now that I think about it&#8230;Airis Sword?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Please don’t. It’s just a hunch, but how about Cleansing Sword?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As suggested by Airis’ voice (?), Reito named the broadsword “Cleansing Sword”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also used Shape Change on the blade: the sword was unwieldy if the blade was too long, so he reduced the size, in order for the blade not to touch the ground when he carried it on his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, that broadsword could not vibrate at high speed like Iceclad Sword: its superior weight, however, made it possible to cut down a Troll even without that ability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought of a new way to fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best thing about this sword is the weight, but it’s too heavy now&#8230;wait, can it get lighter if I use Heavy Strike?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put his hand on the blade, then activated Heavy Strike, a skill that could manipulate gravity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A surge of crimson magic power formed on his hand then flowed into the blade and covered it completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Gravity Blade” acquired&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh, it worked. So this is a skill too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new skill could change the weight of the Cleansing Sword apparently. Reito could now make it lighter when swinging, then turn it heavier when his attacks connected with the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This might be very useful&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to test Gravity Blade, Reito kept it active as he tried various Battle Arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter! Whirlwind! Into Spin Strike!! Finally, Strike Blade!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A powerful gust of wind followed Cleansing Sword’s every swing. When Reito used Strike Blade, which involved all of his muscles, an especially sharp flurry of wind was formed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried holding Cleansing Sword with one hand and activating Iceclad Sword with the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;tough.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wanted to try a few practice swings, but when he held the broadsword with one hand he realized it consumed a great quantity of magic power. Reito ended up sitting on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gravity Sword used up much more magic power than expected. An idea flashed in Reito’s mind, so he contacted Airis about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What is it? I’m rearranging my albums right now&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You’re the one joking now&#8230;can I use SP and learn skills to increase my magic power yet?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, that’s right.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SP were points awarded with each level up, that could be spent to learn new skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had reached level 41 after the battle against the Trolls and currently had 40 SP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, Reito only used SP to learn the Unique Skill “Magic Power Recovery Speed Up”. He had used the one SP he had at level 1 to acquire it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SP consumption changed based on the number of skills acquired with SP and type of skill: if it didn’t match one’s own job, the SP needed to learn it became extremely high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Reito’s case, he could learn Magician skills for one SP at first: two SP for the second, three for the third, and so on. Every time he learned a skill, the SP consumption would increase by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he tried learning skills outside the Magician job, the SP consumption would shoot up to 10. That number was fixed, however: no matter how many skills he learned, it would not change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also possible to use SP to boost acquired skills and also increase the maximum proficiency level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Shall we acquire the “Magic Power Capacity Expansion” skill, then?』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-39481764' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-39481764' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hm? What does it do?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Quite literally, it expands your magic power capacity. It will not only increase your total magic power but also has a good affinity with your Unique Skill “Magic Power Recovery Speed Up”. You should be able to use it without problems.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay then&#8230;oh, this Cross Slash skill seems so cool!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hey!! What are you doing, looking at totally unrelated skills!? Besides, isn’t that for Swordsmen!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several such “detours”, Reito acquired the Magic Power Capacity Expansion skill, as Airis suggested. It was an always active Unique Skill, so it did not have a proficiency level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s the second skill I learn, so it costs two SP&#8230;I have 38 left.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I suggest learning “Magic Effect Up” too. As the name says, it boosts the effects of both offensive and recovery magic.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ooh&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did as he was told and acquired the Unique Skill “Magic Effect Up”, leaving him with 35 SP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His SP decreased considerably, but as it was difficult to learn Unique Skills normally, he certainly did not waste it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I still have plenty, what should I do?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Why don’t we reinforce your skills this time?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Reinforce my skills&#8230;like increasing the max proficiency level?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s not a bad idea, but I would reinforce your Unique Skills first.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito followed Airis’ advice once again and used SP to reinforce his skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SP consumption when reinforcing skills was locked at five: the relatively high cost made it seem like a waste, but Reito did not penny-pinch his SP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>[Unique Skills]</b></p>
<p><b>Magic Power Recovery Speed Up [Level 2]</b></p>
<p><b>Magic Power Capacity Expansion [Level 2]</b></p>
<p><b>Magic Effect Up [Level 2]</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unique Skills had “levels” instead of “proficiency”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Reito could even ask, Airis already started explaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Unique Skills have “levels” in place of “proficiency”: if the level increases, the effect is greater than the average increase of proficiency level.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, that’s great to hear.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You had to use 20 SP total, though. What are you going to do? Learn more skills?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I’d like to have more physical power&#8230;can I reinforce “Might”?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I’m afraid not. Only the skills matching your Jobs can be reinforced.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were limitations on the skills that could be reinforced with SP. Reito gave up on that idea and checked other skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Let’s leave skills reinforcement aside for the moment, then. Is there any new skill I could learn to make my arms stronger?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『There’s the Tech Skill “Mighty Arms”. Martial Artists learn it at level 50, but it’s more effective than Might.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Mighty Arms&#8230;can I learn it too?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You can, but it’ll cost 10 SP, you know? Do you really want to use so many of them now?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm&#8230;guess not.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After level 30, Reito’s pace of leveling up had slowed down. He couldn’t spend SP too carelessly, so he gave up on Mighty Arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well then, let’s see.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication with Airis and picked up the broadsword he had stabbed into the ground. He first activated “Muscle Boost” to enhance his physical abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe thanks to “Magic Effect Up”, he could now wield the broadsword with just one hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh…! How will magic be affected, then? Ice Blade Bullet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ice Block blade was larger than Reito had ever created.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Reito confirmed that magic had greater effects too, he realized his body was less tired than before, despite the fact that he had used a great amount of magic power and felt exhausted just minutes ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s thanks to Magic Power Capacity Expansion and Magic Power Recovery Speed Up I guess&#8230;I shouldn’t run out of magic power easily from now on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt magic power increasingly filling his body and clenched his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had only reinforced his magic power however: since he wanted to boost his physical abilities too, he decided to increase the volume of his training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I need experience in fighting against people&#8230;maybe I really have to study under a sword instructor..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only such person Reito knew was Bal. Being the guildmaster, however, she did not have time to spare giving sword lessons to a single adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito once again contacted Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis-tan.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A -tan suffix, that’s new&#8230;I would have liked Ai-tan better though. Anyway, what is it?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Is there anyone that can give me sword lessons in this town? A dojo or something?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『There is a dojo, but the only person who could teach you to use the broadsword is Bal. Most other broadsword users are Giants, so&#8230; 』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giants valued strength over technique: they preferred crushing their enemies with raw power than besting them with skill. Thus they did not have the ability to teach Humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked troubled, so Airis made a different proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『There’s another type of instructor you could find though.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Which is?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A monster. Find one that can teach you the sword.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;did I hear that right…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito couldn’t believe his ears and Airis continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Actually, monsters that use human weapons are not rare. You have encountered Goblins and Orcs armed with weapons, right? Monsters like those do not only use weapons, they also improve their skills with them.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;but isn’t it impossible to get a monster to teach me?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Not if you just go up to them and ask them to become their disciple. What you need is experience, isn’t it? If you keep hunting down monsters skillful in using weapons, your own techniques will improve too.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;I kind of get what you mean now, but what kind of monsters should I fight then?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Goblins. Do you remember the village that was destroyed by them?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled the village he had visited after leaving the Abyssal Forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village had been attacked by a band of Goblins equipped just like humans, which were actually continuing to raze human settlements in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kingdom’s first princess Nao and her Valkyrja knights were tracking down those Goblins to exterminate them but had not found their whereabouts yet. The Adventurers’ Guilds were looking for them too but hadn’t found anything yet either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis, however, knew everything happening in the whole world: that of course included the location of the armed Goblins, their hideout, and even their exact numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thus revealed the “secret” to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Those armed Goblins are not wild: they are controlled by a Monster Tamer.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A Monster Tamer? It’s the job that can make monsters into allies, right?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『More precisely, it allows the usage of Covenant magic, which can bend monsters to your will. Covenant magic can only be used with monsters: if it succeeds, the targeted monster will obey the caster’s commands.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;so this Monster Tamer is ordering the Goblins to attack villages?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That seems to be the case. This is not the doing of a single Tamer, however, but five of them.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was speechless.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-37576765' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-37576765' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Why would they do such a thing…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They belong to an organization plotting against the kingdom. There are several organizations hostile to this country, but the former empire’s forces bear especially deep resentment against it.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『There was an empire here before?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It existed in this Human territory, yes. Other than this Kingdom of Baltros, founded by your ancestor, there also was an Empire of Baltros, which ruled over its people with its military might.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, the ruler of Human territories was not the kingdom, but the Baltros empire. The empire, through its many war campaigns, had brought a heavy toll on its population: exasperated, the people tried to rebel but were brutally suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The son of the 13th generation emperor, however, could not ignore the pleas of the suffering population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This led to the foundation of the Baltros kingdom. Much of the population and even part of the military forces of Baltros rallied under the prince’s flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, the 13th emperor was enraged by his son’s revolt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war between the Baltros empire and the kingdom thus started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The empire’s military power overwhelmed the newly founded kingdom, but the political circumstances at the time favored the rebels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging the new kingdom to be more easily controllable than the empire, the neighboring countries sided with the former.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kingdom thus succeeded in defeating the empire: the emperor fell in battle, the imperial family executed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of the extended imperial family escaped such a fate, however: they survived and gave birth to descendants, who continued to hate and resent the kingdom for centuries, and plot the reconstruction of the empire even now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such pro empire forces are involved in various activities in order to bring down the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Airis’ explanation, Reito spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So the Monster Tamers commanding the Goblins belong to this pro empire group?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s right. Though I think that among the members of this faction, only 20 or so truly plan to rebuild the empire. Those Monster Tamers are trying to form an army of monsters&#8230;but could only tame weak Goblins. That does not mean they are not a threat though.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Aren’t Orcs or Kobolds stronger than Goblins?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Goblins are smarter though. They can understand human speech and do not mind wearing human equipment. Orcs and Kobolds loathe wearing armor you see.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Nao said something about Goblin Knights last time&#8230;is that what you mean?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito told Nao that some of the Goblins that attacked the village were larger than others, Nao had mentioned such advanced Goblins. Using human gear was not enough for Goblins to become “Knights” however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『As I explained before, Goblin Knights are evolved Goblins. By eating the flesh of other monsters, Goblins can grow larger and more powerful.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;but what can I do by myself against such dangerous people?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It would be reckless to fight them all together, but with the right plan, you can surely manage. Your objective is to improve your skills with the sword, but you might as well take care of these five monster tamers while you’re at it I think.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『All five of them…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Fortunately, they all use different locations as hideouts. Moving in large groups would attract the royal army’s attention, so they are being very careful about it. However, none of that matters before me!! I can find them no matter where they hide!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ tone brimmed with confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Though, if we told the royal army about their location, we might get a reward&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That is true too. But without precise information the army will not move&#8230;and you, Reito, need to remember that you are supposed to be in hiding!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Airis said was completely true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was thus half-convinced, half coaxed into a Monster Tamer hunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh, one more thing. Before heading to the Monster Tamers’ hideout, you should stock up on food and water supplies.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh, why? I don’t want to carry luggage if I can help it&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You have your Storage magic, so that’s not an issue. Make sure you have seasonings and cooking tools too.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;.?』</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several days later, Reito — duly prepared according to Airis’ advice — left the Adventure City together with Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first location designed by Airis was the Ymir coal mine, located in the ominous mountain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would take two whole days to arrive on a regular horse, but only a few hours for Ullr. The two thus headed towards the mine, while taking breaks once in a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So that’s the place&#8230;more than a mine, it just looks like a rocky mountain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr was breezing through grasslands when they spotted their destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Airis had anticipated, a large rocky mass stood in the middle of the grassland, its shape concave like a volcano. The pit was located there, though it had already been emptied of all of its coal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, the Ymir coal mine was inhabited by various kinds of monsters, and people rarely, if ever, visited it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Airis, one of the pro-empire Monster Tamers used the mine as a base: part of the Goblin corps was also kept there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr, we have to stay alert from here on out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr nodded to Reito’s warning as they proceeded towards the Ymir mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mountain saw frequent human traffic in the past, so there was a paved road leading to it: Reito and Ullr could approach their destination without risk of losing their way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Doesn’t look like the monsters here are too dangerous&#8230;it’s a good place for you to hunt, Ullr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the Orc he just defeated and put the broadsword on his back. Ullr pounced the monster’s corpse and started eating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He preferred his meat cooked rather than raw, but there was no time for that now. Reito took out a bottle and replenished his liquids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Assassin skills Reito knew, he could move without alerting monsters. Those skills did not affect Ullr, however, so Reito continued fighting as they climbed the mountain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goblins and Orcs dwelled on the mountain: both monsters posed little threat, but their numbers were abundant. The adventurers who came to this location thus came in groups as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito whispered to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a bit tough, just the two of us&#8230;we never encountered so many monsters in the Abyssal Forest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito wiped the blood from his broadsword, looking at the many Goblin corpses strewn on the ground. After finishing his meal, Ullr returned to his side and they proceeded on their way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one was looking at them, so Reito spoke to Ullr in the wolf (dog?) language he had learned during their four years together in the forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bow!! Bow!!” (You’re eating like a pig, buddy!!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!” (But I’m so hungry!!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bow!! Arf! Arff!” (That’s no excuse to stuff yourself like that!! Cut it out or you’re fasting!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine…” (Everything but that…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo chatted as they climbed, eventually reaching the summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mountain used to have a peak, but apparently about one century ago a meteor had fallen on it, thus at present the central portion of the mountain was caved in, like a volcano.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curiously enough, after the meteor fell a vein of Mithril was found in the mountain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kingdom built an excavation site in the mountain and also changed its name to “Ymir”, the name originally given to the meteor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This must be the excavation site&#8230;it’s gotten pretty late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time Reito and Ullr arrived, it was already late afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The excavation site, however, was dimly illuminated: despite the fact that the mine was supposed to be abandoned, some of the lights were still active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated his Assassin skills: Stealth, Soundless Walk, Detect Presence and Seal Presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also used Swift Legs, to increase his movement speed, and Night Vision, which allowed him to see clear as day even in the darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airisch?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Oh my, did you suddenly develop a lisp? Or could you have acquired a Tongue-Tied skill out of the blue?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I seriously hope not&#8230;anyway, target confirmed. Awaiting instructions, Ota*on.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Who are you calling Ot*con!?』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-30737789' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-30737789' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito opened communication with Airis while observing the excavation site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the other end of his gaze stood a Goblin, holding a torch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was larger than the average Goblin, almost as tall as a human. It was also equipped with a sword, armor, and a helmet belonging to the royal army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a total of 10 Goblins in the surroundings, all armed in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito could not see anyone resembling a Monster Tamer in the vicinity, but there was no doubt that those were the Goblins were part of the horde responsible for ransacking towns and villages in the Lunot area.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins were patrolling the excavation site, on the watch for intruders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『So these are the tamed Goblins&#8230;they don’t look or act normal at all, that’s for sure.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『They will be good sources of experience. The Monster Tamer is inside the mine, apparently, so you don’t have to worry about being found out. Get up, go out there and take care of them, easy as pie!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You sure make it sound easy!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication and made eye contact with Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He decided to target the Goblins patrolling away from the main group first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Goblins were patrolling together: one yawned and the other scolded it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both wielded spears and wore chest armor and iron gauntlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito quickly and silently approached them from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeeh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the Goblins noticed and turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Seal Presence, however, Reito’s presence was suppressed to a minimum: it would take the Goblin some time before it could fully realize Reito was there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that could happen, Reito activated Iceclad Sword to create an Ice Block dagger and flung it at the head of the Goblin who noticed him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Puncture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gweh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dagger penetrated the small gap in the Goblin’s helmet and pierced its cranium, killing the monster on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Goblin naturally realized something was wrong, but Reito immediately activated the Throwing skill, picked up the dagger, and threw it again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dagger struck the Goblin right between its eyes before it could yell. Reito and Ullr propped up the two dead Goblins before they fell: they wanted to cause as little noise as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Goblins had not noticed their ambush yet, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr gently let the two Goblins on the ground, then looked for the next target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay&#8230;let’s get those ones next. There’s more this time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito located three Goblins in another spot, then approached them with Ullr. Using the same tactic as before had a high risk of alerting the other Goblins, so he decided to suppress them by force this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr, howl as loud as you can 10 seconds from now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m counting on you, buddy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then activated the Leap skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He jumped close to the three Goblins, opened his Magic Storage subspace and took out his new Cleansing Sword. At the same moment—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AWOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s howl echoed in the surroundings, attracting the attention of all Goblins present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used the opportunity to approach the three Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghweh….!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, his physical abilities augmented in advance with Muscle Boost, swung his broadsword on one of the Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were all wearing helmets and armor, but Reito’s attack shattered them all too easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s Cleansing Sword, changed via Metal Transmutation to the hardest metal in his former world, cleaved the Goblin in two halves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Witnessing their brethren’s brutal end up close, the other two Goblins were shaken to the core. Reito did not give them time to recover and proceeded with his next attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwhyaaahhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito spun on his axis as he swung his sword, blowing the two Goblins away. The monsters’ armor could not sustain the broadsword’s power: their upper and lower bodies were torn apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the remaining Goblins, guarding the entrance to the mine, and activated Leap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHEEEHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins, enraged, readied their weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, holding his Cleansing Sword high, attacked first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whirlwind!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwhyah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cleansing Sword traced a horizontal sweep, targeting two of the Goblins. One of them was blown away, while the other crouched to dodge the attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had attacked at a speed normal Goblins could not react to, but the Ymir mine Goblins were clearly more powerful than the average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other Goblins moved to counterattack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeehh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeeh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Goblins, armed with short swords, tried attacking Reito, but Ullr intercepted them: with a tackle, the White Wolf sent them flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin that crouched to avoid Reito’s attack tried stabbing his legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYAH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Wind Blade spell at his feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gust of wind, released at close distance, threw the Goblin’s body against a nearby boulder. Blood dripped from the monster’s mouth: not even the armor it wore could shield the impact completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gyheah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheee!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr grabbed one of the Goblins by the neck and tossed it towards another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the last Goblin standing. It was one head taller than the others and had a fairly muscular body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYEEHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa, it’s pretty big&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin was not as large as a Blood Bear, but was equally as intimidating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then understood that the opponent he was facing was not an average Goblin, but a Goblin Knight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Knight carried a broadsword on its back: the sword was apparently made in magic metal, like Bal’s, and its blade glowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The material composing the Goblin Knight’s broadsword was Crystal: while its appearance was very similar to glass, it was much more resilient than steel and had high resistance to magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito held his Cleansing Sword tightly and faced the Goblin Knight head-on. They then moved at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and the Goblin Knight’s broadswords clashed loudly: the impact forced both of them to retreat, with a surprised look on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Knight was surprised to be pushed back by a smaller opponent, while Reito was surprised to realize that the Goblin Knight was as powerful as an Ogre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Knight had superior physical strength, but by using all of his strength Reito could match it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Knight furiously swung its sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYEEEHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito barely managed to endure the monster’s violent flurry of swings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not his first time facing a monster armed with a weapon, but the Goblin Knight was different from the monsters Reito battled in the past. It did not rely only on brute force but seemed to mimic the movements of human swordsmen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin Knight and Reito’s swords clashed again: eventually the monster won the deadlock and pushed Reito backward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It then kicked out with its right leg, aiming at Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito managed to parry with the hilt of his sword, but he couldn’t fully protect himself against the Goblin Knight’s massive foot, and was ultimately sent flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ow, ouch!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYEEHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skills Break Fall and Resilient allowed Reito to reduce damage to a minimum, but before he could stand back up the Goblin Knight was already looming over him with its broadsword crashing down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHEEEHHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Circle Parry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito managed to activate the skill in time: the Goblin Knight’s broadsword was thrown off to the side and stabbed the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not let go of the chance and readied his broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Strike Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ggyaaahhh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using all of his muscles and rotating momentum, Reito targeted the Goblin Knight’s neck — the monster, still leaning forward, could not move in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito’s broadsword was painted red, the Goblin Knight’s head rolled on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, panting heavily, swung the broadsword to wipe away the blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had successfully defeated the Goblin Knight: he put the broadsword on his back, took a moment of rest and headed into the mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr carefully proceeded inside: lanterns were hanging from the ceiling of the mine, providing illumination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s definitely someone here, but&#8230;Ullr, can you pick any human scent?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr, his nose against the ground, started sniffing. Soon enough, he found human tracks and ran off. Reito followed him, while keeping wary of their surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mine was large enough for a Giant to fit through: Reito could swing his broadsword without fear of hitting any obstacles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sniff&#8230;sniff&#8230;woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It echoes in here, you have to be more quiet&#8230;this way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr proceeded carefully: he used Detect Presence to find any hostile creatures as they ventured deeper in the mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, they found a steel door. Ullr stopped in front of it, signaling that the smell continued beyond the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito nodded to Ullr and contacted Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis.』</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-42709759' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-42709759' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s alright, you can open the door and go on.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito slowly turned the door handle, wary of any traps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing he noticed as he opened the door was the smell of decay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrowl&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were countless cages along the walls on the left and right side of the room, filled with the corpses of Goblin children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled the young Goblin that had saved him and Ullr when they fought against Blood Bears in the Abyssal Forest; he couldn’t bear to look and covered his eyes. Ullr came closer to him, concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to calm down, Reito whispered to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s alright&#8230;I’m fine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stepped inside one of the cages, in order to examine it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins had been killed and left there for days, apparently. Reito looked at the rotting bodies, holding back feelings of nausea, and eventually found a corpse in relatively good condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This one&#8230;the blood hasn’t hardened yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pool of blood surrounded the small Goblin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from its wounds, it had not been cut down with a sword or blade, but showed signs of being struck by a blunt weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did they torture it…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblin showed signs of bone fracture all over its body: its arms and legs were bent and twisted in unnatural directions. Most of its fangs and all of its claws had also been removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goblins could not speak human languages: unlike other human or humanlike beings, it should be impossible to gather information from them through torture. Reito wondered what could have been the objective of whoever tortured the Goblins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then inspected the Goblin corpses for any traces of the Covenant magic the Monster Tamers supposedly used on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monster Tamers engrave the so-called Covenant Mark on the monsters they tame. The Goblin corpses left in the cages, however, showed no such mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis! What happened here?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Have you looked inside the cages? This is how the pro-empire faction acts. They catch Goblins and torture them, in order to implant hatred of humans in them. The Goblins possessed by strong hatred become extremely feral and attack humans without fear of death. Most of the Goblins cannot endure the torture, however. The result is what you see.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Why would&#8230;anyone do such a thing&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The pro-empire faction is quite disappointed with the Monster Tamers’ lack of ability, as they can only subjugate Goblins. So they are trying to at least create strong Goblins: no matter how much they loathe humans, Goblins will never turn against whoever engraved the Covenant Mark on them.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;that’s just sick.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the communication and clenched his fist in frustration. Disgusted by the vicious acts, committed as if it was nothing, he punched the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expressions of the dead Goblins were all twisted in agony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this place deserted…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr ran towards a wall in the back of the room and pointed at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the wall and activated Observing Eye, revealing that part of the brick wall was in a different color, yellow instead of red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito prudently touched the yellow brick, which retracted inside the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a secret passage?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Reito pushed the yellow brick, an iron ladder came down from the ceiling. There was another floor above, apparently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A ladder&#8230;Ullr, you wait here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bark if anything happens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito ordered Ullr to stand guard and started climbing the ladder, but his Detect Presence skill flared up: something or someone was approaching from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately activated Leap and moved away from the ladder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next instant, a massive figure jumped down from the floor above, landing with a loud rumble. The giant creature looked at Reito from head to toe, then slowly opened its mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aaahn…? Who&#8230;aaare&#8230;you&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s&#8230;a person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrowl….!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr backed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man, his face covered by a silver mask, had a physique as large and bloated as an Orc. It wielded a large hatchet and was covered in blood all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man’s bloodshot eyes, visible through a gap in the mask, darted as he spoke again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where do&#8230;you come from…? This is&#8230;my home…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This place&#8230;is your home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes&#8230;home&#8230;all of this abandoned mine&#8230;is my home!! Get out, now!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man swung his hatchet down on Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reached for the broadsword on his back, but did not have enough time to draw it. He quickly turned around, blocking the large man’s hatched with the broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rraaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was pushed back against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr jumped in to protect him, bared his fangs at the large man and tried to bite him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man used his free hand to rummage through his clothes, then threw some yellow powder at Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Urrah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yiip!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha&#8230;this is monster feces, ground to dust&#8230;it works best with dogs like you, right…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s sharp sense of smell could not withstand the intense odor: he fell and started thrashing about on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Ullr, however, an opening was formed. Reito moved to the back of the large man, crimson magic power surging in his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heavy Strike!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woooh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gravity-charged fist sent the large man crashing against the cages. Reito, however, felt something was off with the impact and looked at his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man’s flesh felt too soft to be human, unpleasantly so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Owch&#8230;you little bastard…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man stood back up as if nothing happened. Reito’s fist could slay Orcs and Kobolds in one blow, but it did not seem to affect the large man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room, riddled with cages, was too narrow to swing his broadsword. Reito thus decided to use magic, but—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something fell from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghyeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Goblin child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man looked at the Goblin, its body covered in wounds and scars, and moaned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh…? Tch&#8230;it’s still alive&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, something clicked in Reito’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large man was responsible for torturing the Goblins. He bludgeoned and sliced them with his hatchet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s voice trembled in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the..hell are you…!?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me…? I’m Basil&#8230;Lord Basil, Monster Tamer&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re&#8230;a Monster Tamer…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought Monster Tamers were a kind of magic users, but the man before him, more similar to a monster than a human, completely betrayed his expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aah…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was facing Basil, unable to move, when he felt something grabbing his leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the wounded Goblin child: it opened its mouth, as if to say something, but only blood came out. Reito was once again reminded of the Goblin that helped him in the fight against the Blood Bears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the agonizing Goblin, Reito clenched his teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito drew his broadsword and thrusted it in the Goblin’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was already too late for the small monster: the only thing Reito could do was to spare it any more suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lifeless Goblin crumpled on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey!! You little&#8230;how dare you kill my underling…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;underling…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That thing&#8230;was going to become my underling, in just a little more time&#8230;tch&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why&#8230;why did you torture it so much? If you were going to tame it, what’s the point in hurting it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? You don’t know anything&#8230;aah, right, lord Gain said that Goblins get stronger if you hurt them&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gain, huh&#8230;I don’t know who that is, but I can just ask Airis later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huuh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway&#8230;you’re going down now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated Storage magic and put away his broadsword, then clenched his fist. Soon enough, crimson magic power surged in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil had the feeling that his opponent, much smaller than him, suddenly increased in size. Cold sweats ran down his spine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what&#8230;did you&#8230;you will fight me&#8230;barehanded…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t say another word.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated Stealth, Seal Presence, and Soundless Walk, effectively disappearing from Basil’s sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next instant, he activated Muscle Boost and struck the large man with his fists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hnngh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s punch, boosted to the limit, sank into Basil’s stomach.Reito felt an unusual sensation, like before, but continued to punch nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Daah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gfwah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then tried putting all of his strength in the attack, like when he used Strike Blade. His flurry of punches continued, using Basil’s body like a sandbag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil moaned in pain and swung his hatchet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-you little…! That hurt…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stopped the approaching hatchet with his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He immediately activated Metal Transmutation, turning the hatchet into a soft material, then used Shape Change to bend it in a way it would be useless as a blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil simply stared, dumbfounded by the chain of events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the!? Y-you&#8230;gwah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you to shut up!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;Craft Skill “Strike Fist” acquired&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil dropped his hatchet, as Reito’s newly acquired skill struck his stomach without mercy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orrah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GWEEEHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fist then pounded the man’s face. Basil collapsed on the ground with a shrill wail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forceful attack had cracked and shattered the silver mask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil’s face was thus finally revealed: after one glance at it, Reito stepped backwards, surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gah…! Gwah…! D-don’t you&#8230;dare look at my face…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought Basil to be a human being, but his face was covered in green skin. His teeth were sharp and crooked like a beast: the tooth decay was so strong that Reito could smell his putrid breath even from a distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not a human being’s face, but a Goblin’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8230;you’re a monster…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut up!! I’m human!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil attacked, infuriated by Reito’s words, but Reito grabbed him first and threw him over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Urryah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito slammed Basil on the ground, his clothes were torn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil’s skin became exposed, showing its disgusting, repugnant state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;is this your real body…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-DAMN YOUUUU!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil’s body too was covered in Goblin-like green skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His body was similar, but not identical to a Goblin. The skin color was the same, but the shape of his hands and face were human: only the skin and fangs were Goblin-like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, witnessing a creature that resembled a botched fusion between a Human and a Goblin, was at a loss for words. Basil stood back up, more furious than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You little…!! I’ll never&#8230;forgive you&#8230;how dare you&#8230;look&#8230;at me…!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;you’re&#8230;a Demon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Reito said, Basil was indeed a Demon, a race of creatures that possessed both human and monster-like characteristics. Basil was a Demon with Goblin-like characteristics: because of this, he was persecuted and ended up developing a twisted personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil had never even seen his parents: he was still very young when a slave trader picked him up, planning to sell him to nobles interested in keeping Demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the slave trader’s expectations, however, Basil never found a buyer: when he had grown too much for the trader to keep him, he was given to one of his acquaintances, a Monster Tamer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This tamer, a member of the pro-empire faction, picked up an interest in Basil and taught him the art of monster taming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Basil became a full-fledged tamer himself and a member of the pro-empire faction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was given the task of training and engraving the Covenant Mark on the Goblins sent to the Ymir coal mine, in order to turn them into members of the monster army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of his innate temperament, however, he definitely did not excel at his job…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil, back on his feet, charged Reito again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WOOOHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oops.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito moved one step to the side and dodged. The ability to avoid attacks with the least necessary effort was something he had acquired during his life in the Abyssal Forest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito moved behind Basil’s unguarded back.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-81878362' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-81878362' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He activated Spin Strike barehanded: Reito spun on his axis and elbowed Basil on the back of his head, making him fall spectacularly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, such an attack would prove lethal, but the Demon Basil did not seem to be particularly affected. Basil’s race was probably the reason why Reito felt something was off when he hit him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil glared at Reito, rubbing the back of his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shit&#8230;shit&#8230;what the hell&#8230;are you…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re really tough&#8230;oh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Support spell Muscle Boost was deactivated and Reito returned to his original physical abilities. Basil did not let the opportunity pass by and attacked, his arms open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DIEEEE!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROOOOWL!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was stopped by Ullr, however, who jumped on the large man and knocked him down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blocked by the horse-sized wolf, Basil could not move. The more he tried to, the deeper Ullr’s claws sank into his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghaaah!? Let go, you damned dog…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrr….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keep him down like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito lifted his palm over Basil, forced to immobility by Ullr. He was going to use a magic spell to knock him unconscious when someone came down the ladder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a group of five Goblins, all covered in blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More Goblins…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oooh..oohhh!! You!! Help me…!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil’s order was met by hollow stares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized that there was something strange in the Goblins’ behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They showed no sign of attacking Reito, like the Goblins guarding the entrance to the cave. Quite the opposite: they were glaring at Basil, their eyes filled with hate and resentment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeeeh….!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What, what are you looking at me for? You dare rebel against me!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Basil shouted—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;gheyah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaahhh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins bit on his leg, ripping the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Goblins’ bite was deep enough to reveal the bone. Basil screamed, but Ullr bit on his other leg and broke its bone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghaah!? L-let go!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito called Ullr to come closer. Basil, both of his legs wounded, was writhing on the floor. The Goblins looked down at him, silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized what was going to happen and decided to leave the room. Basil raised his voice behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-wait, you bastard!! Where do you think you’re— ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You better worry about yourself first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeeh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghaah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aaah!? Y-you little….don’t get any closer…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil’s screams reached Reito’s ears even outside the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned around only once, to see the Goblins ravage Basil’s body, despite his desperate thrashing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-wait, please!! Please help me!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;so long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-NOOOO!!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GHYEEEHHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil’s screams echoed in the cave, as the Goblins he “tamed” bit all over his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito closed the door, without a word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew what kind of fate Basil was going to suffer at the hands of the Goblins, but felt no pity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You reap what you sow&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr, worried, licked Reito’s face, so the boy rubbed his head to reassure him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They decided to exit the mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had thus successfully found one of the monster tamers of the pro-empire faction, but could not muster the will to capture Basil and bring him to the royal authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr simply walked out of the Ymir coal mine.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several minutes later, the door leading to the room full of cages was opened again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single Goblin emerged from the room. Inside, Basil was lying against a wall, surrounded by Goblin bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil desperately struggled until the end: as a result, only one Goblin survived the “battle”. The Goblin was not unscathed: it had lost its left arm and dragged its feet as it walked out of the mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears streamed from the Goblin’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled Reito’s figure, who had left at the very end. Why did a Human choose to abandon a Demon — a creature so similar to him? Why did he act as if he stood on the side of monsters like them? The Goblin could not understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the Goblin reached the conclusion that among Humans there were also those who did not unconditionally see monsters as enemies.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several minutes later, the door leading to the room full of cages was opened again.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After exterminating the armed Goblins and the Monster Tamer in the Ymir mines, Reito returned to the Adventure City Lunot. On the way, he communicated with Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told her what happened in the mine and Airis explained as if she knew everything already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The Ymir coal mine is one of the pro-empire faction’s hideouts. Its actual function, however, was to lock up the “undesirable” Basil.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Lock up…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Basil had a history of ignoring orders and killing Goblins. His excessive tortures ended up decreasing the number of the Goblin troops. At first, they tried to admonish and keep using him, but gave up when he killed three of his superiors who brought him new orders.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『He even killed his own comrades? Oh right, he mentioned someone called Gain&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Gain is one of the heads of the pro-empire faction. He belongs to the military side of the organization and is definitely skilled in battle: hundreds of royal soldiers have already died at his hands. But even Gain feared Basil, apparently.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see&#8230;so, what’s the next target?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Next target already? Quite proactive of you&#8230;let’s take a small detour and stop by a village. The direction is&#8230;』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several minutes later, the door leading to the room full of cages was opened again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single Goblin emerged from the room. Inside, Basil was lying against a wall, surrounded by Goblin bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basil desperately struggled until the end: as a result, only one Goblin survived the “battle”. The Goblin was not unscathed: it had lost its left arm and dragged its feet as it walked out of the mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears streamed from the Goblin’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled Reito’s figure, who had left at the very end. Why did a Human choose to abandon a Demon — a creature so similar to him? Why did he act as if he stood on the side of monsters like them? The Goblin could not understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gheeh….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the Goblin reached the conclusion that among Humans there were also those who did not unconditionally see monsters as enemies.</span></p><p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>
