<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-16"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 2: The Neighbor Agreement</h1>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei arrived back in my room exactly one hour later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had changed into a neat dress, which was more cute than mature.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had taken a shower and even put on a light makeup.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Seeing Sensei in her casual clothes for the first time on a day off, I found myself getting nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was as stunningly beautiful as ever, but her expression was more stern than before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered why.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What had happened in this one hour?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it because the sheets that she took smelled bad?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I regretted not washing them more often.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please come in. Breakfast is ready.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you. I’ll join you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After Sensei returned to the room, I quickly took a shower too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since Sensei was sleeping, I hesitated to take a bath and ended up sleeping on the floor last night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, an incredibly beautiful woman was sleeping vulnerably on my bed right beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was impossible not to be conscious of her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It took a long time to fall asleep, and my sleep was shallow, so I really wanted to go back to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I felt that if I missed this chance, I might lose the opportunity to talk with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, with nothing to lose, I invited her for breakfast, and she said she will eat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I must respond to that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Saturdays are usually relaxed mornings for me, but today was different.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After leaving the bathroom, I changed and drank black coffee to wake up my sleep-deprived mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, timing it with her arrival, I started preparing breakfast for two.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s nothing much, but please enjoy the food.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s impressive that you actually cook something like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I usually cut more corners. I just tried a bit harder because Sensei is here.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">On the table, there were French toast and crispy bacon, along with leftover salad and soup from yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For dessert, I had yogurt with strawberries I received from Sensei.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You seem to be good at cooking; you’ll make a great husband in the future.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In the bright morning light, Tenjō-sensei looked at me with admiration.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, are you not good at cooking?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei sat in the same spot as yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, I like doing household chores. It feels good to clean and see everything neat. Right now, I just don’t have time for it. I get frustrated with the laundry piling up, and not being able to cook for myself bothers me, as it affects my nutritional balance──Ah, I’m complaining again…Why do I talk so much when I’m talking to you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei smiled wryly as if she didn’t understand why.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I think Sensei would make a good wife too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t really picture myself in marriage. For me, love and marriage are impossible without the right person.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see. Well, for now, please feel free to choose your drink. Coffee or tea, what do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Coffee, please. Can I get milk and sugar with it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright. You can go ahead and start eating.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I poured the coffee I had brewed in excess into a mug.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After preparing everything she requested, I brought it to the table.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Your morning coffee, sorry to keep you waiting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t say it in a weird way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just coffee in the morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It sounds suggestive.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Being told that while she blushed made me self-conscious too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To fill the awkward silence, we both started eating without a word.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, the French toast is sweet and fluffy. Ah, it would be great if I could have a proper breakfast like this every day, not just on days off.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei seemed happy to have a leisurely meal in the morning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you not eat breakfast on weekdays?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to sleep in as much as possible, so I don’t have time to prepare anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your alarm goes off a lot in the morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“!? You can hear it from your room? I’m sorry for being noisy so early!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to that, I haven’t overslept either.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it bothers you, you should have told me…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei shrank her shoulders in disappointment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, I finished the strawberries you gave me. They were delicious.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right? I still have some at home. Why don’t you eat more? It would be a waste if they go bad.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe freeze the ones you can’t eat? Mixing them with milk or yogurt to make a smoothie is also a good idea.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. My freezer is pretty full, so I don’t think they’ll all fit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, how about cooking those expensive strawberries with sugar to make jam?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s best to eat high-quality strawberries as they are, but it’s better than throwing them away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Jam! That’s it! Nishiki-kun, nice idea!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her mood brightened as if everything was resolved, and I cautiously suggested.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, do you have enough empty jars to store all the jam?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Making jam at home is easy, but I don’t know how many strawberries are left.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once you add sugar to make jam, it’s hard to eat it all at once.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…No.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her uplifted mood plummeted. She’s an easy-to-read person.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Bring the strawberries you can’t eat later. I have jars, so let’s make it in my room.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I kept some empty jars thinking they might be useful someday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I appreciate it, but I feel bad always having you do things for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a thank you for washing my sheets.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s because I took over your bed in the first place!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mind as long as I get some of the jam. I have no plans this weekend anyway, so it’s a good way to kill time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay..Then, in return, I’ll bring some bread that goes well with the jam.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Doesn’t that mean we’ll never end this cycle of owing each other?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s great that she always wants to return a favor, but I haven’t done anything significant.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t have any bread stored in my room, so I’m just going to buy some for myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can share some regular bread with you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I still have a few slices left, so I can give some to Sensei.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t stand leaving a debt unpaid.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, you’re more conscientious than I thought. That’s surprising.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Someone as beautiful as Reiyu Tenjō must have received all kinds of kindness, whether out of goodwill or ulterior motives.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she responded to all of it, she would wear herself out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought she would be used to drawing the line with a smile and gratitude.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This time is special. Thanks to you, I can use the strawberries my grandmother sent without wasting them, so I’m really happy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei smiled genuinely, looking truly happy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her radiant smile was more natural and gentle than the one I usually see in the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Caught off guard by her expression directed only at me in my room, I found myself mesmerized and forgot my nervousness.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“You really love your grandmother, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“She’s the only one in my family who’s always been on my side, and the reason I chose my current job is largely influenced by her being a teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, that’s why she sends you more of your favorite strawberries than you can eat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah… that’s because I used to eat the amount she sent without any problem when I was younger.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She confessed with a bashful look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Despite being slim, you eat a lot.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just can’t stand being hungry. I love delicious food. Is that bad?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it’s good. I was also happy that you ate a lot of my curry yesterday.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei had fallen asleep yesterday, so I expressed my gratitude now for her finishing the curry neatly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Stop thanking me! I feel guilty for eating too much.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She narrowed her eyes as if to apologize.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine as long as your waist doesn’t suffer.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m keeping that in check.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She placed her hands on her hips as if to show off her toned waist.</p>

<p class="calibre4">By the time we finished breakfast, we had returned to the kind of conversation we’d have at school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so, we finally got to the main topic.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;First of all, the fact that we’re neighbors should remain a secret here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course. I’ll do everything to keep it from being discovered. I won’t let Sensei lose her job.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s a given.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. Unfortunately, we have enough circumstantial evidence to be misunderstood.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even though we’re in different rooms, the situation of a teacher and student living under the same roof is not looked upon favorably by society.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Depending on how it’s perceived, it could lead to significant social damage.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We have no choice but to be careful in our daily lives.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be careful too. On top of that, we need to decide what to do moving forward.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The most certain solution would be for one of us to move out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The earliest I can move is during the summer vacation. Of course, I could throw money at a moving company, but honestly, I don’t have that much saved up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Or I could move back to my parents’ house.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t really like this idea, but sometimes you have to make sacrifices.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is your family home within commuting distance, Nishiki-kun?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Barely.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My response slightly furrows Sensei’s brows.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, following the flow of the conversation, why are you living alone as a high school student?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Naturally, that’s a question she would be curious about.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My mother remarried, and well, there were some troubles, so I decided to live separately.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I explained my situation briefly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, Tenjō-sensei’s expression changed completely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Switching to teacher mode, she faced me with a serious look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You decided? Did you choose to live alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. It’s not like I was kicked out by my mother or anything really serious like that, so please don’t worry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you managing your living expenses okay? Do you have any other troubles?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei looked around my room, then continued to probe further.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I receive enough from my biological father so that I don’t need to work part-time. He does insist that I focus on my studies in return.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My father is excellent at his job, but he’s always been a man of few words and not good at expressing affection.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He always prioritized work and rarely came home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, my parents divorced when I started middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For me, it was normal for my father to be absent from home since I was young, so becoming a single-parent family didn’t feel like a big change.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, my workaholic father has always loved me in his own way, albeit awkwardly. I understand that much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why I first discussed wanting to live alone with him, and he didn’t hesitate to support me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry to ask something personal, but how is your relationship with your new family?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei still seemed concerned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My stepfather and stepsister are really nice people. Both of them have said they want me to come back home soon…It’s more that I’ve had a falling out with my biological mother.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your mom, huh… That must be tough.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei showed empathy as if she had a similar experience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing her look so pained as if it were her own issue, I felt somewhat guilty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this day and age, divorce and remarriage aren’t uncommon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, conflicts between parents and their teenage children are a common story worldwide.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just thought it would be better for both of us to be apart rather than making the atmosphere at home worse. Thanks to that, I’m free from my parents’ watchful eyes and enjoying my carefree life alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…are you putting on a brave face?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei asked sharply.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not at all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei quietly stared at my face as if trying to find out something.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;You had to grow up quickly, huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Eventually, she relaxed her expression as if she had come to an understanding.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Having troubles with parents is just a sign of being a kid, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really, is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Listening to you talk, it doesn’t feel like you left home just because of your mom.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why do you think that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t seem to hate or be angry at your mom.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was surprised and at a loss for words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, given your personality, it seems more like you distanced yourself out of consideration for someone else.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei speculated, almost as if talking to herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t come to hate my mother or anything. But I’m also not dissatisfied with my current life, so I’d rather not go back.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She didn’t probe any deeper.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you ever have any trouble, don’t hesitate to consult me. I will be there to help you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Not intruding too much, yet also not distancing herself too far.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite her flustered state upon waking up, this beautiful teacher offered reliable support to me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei. I know I’ve invited you to meals several times, but maybe it’s better if we don’t meet too much in private.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She’s a person of deep emotions. I appreciate it, but I also feel somewhat guilty.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now that I know, I just can’t remain indifferent. If you feel hesitant to discuss with your homeroom teacher, then rely on me as your neighborhood Onee-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She said this with a bright voice and a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While people might focus on her beauty, her most charming trait might be her natural kindness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Setting aside the complicated circumstances, she certainly had the gentleness of an adult who is concerned about a high school student living alone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Beautiful and yet so gallant, that’s just being too greedy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I feel like I can’t leave you alone because you remind me of my younger brother.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She added this as if it was an afterthought.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei’s brother… He must be quite the handsome guy too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If the sister is like this, the brother must undoubtedly be good-looking as well.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know about looks since that’s subjective, but mentally, you’re far more put-together than he is.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t really feel like I’m all that put-together.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m the same way. Society may consider me an adult, but I don’t feel like one at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The line between adults and children seems to be vague.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Age, experience, titles&mdash;&mdash;these alone don’t make the distinction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I guess Yuunagi Nishiki and Reiyu Tenjō are equals as human beings long as we are in this apartment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If that’s the case, I’m happy, and I’ll try to push myself to be worthy of that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. I’m also a working adult with mental limitations, a woman who ended up crying in front of you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She says this jokingly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You like to act cool, don’t you, Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Adults hate to be embarrassed, so they don’t want to show their weaknesses. Well, it’s too late for that with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sensei looked cute even when looking weak.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“See, you shouldn’t tease adults like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Feeling that the beautiful Onee-san next door is attractive is a natural thing for a man.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I say this with a romantic notion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, leave the moving matter to me. I’ll somehow manage to move during the summer break. Until then, I’m sorry, but we’ll have to endure living as neighbors.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei concludes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve been living here without any problems even before I knew my neighbor was Sensei. So, there’s nothing for me to endure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The sound of my alarm clock has been bothering you every morning, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei looked a bit guilty.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In exchange for asking Tenjō-sensei to move, I have a suggestion too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A suggestion? What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll take care of your meals from now on, Sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The words came out more easily than I expected.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m surprised at how nice you are.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei looked utterly astonished.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not a big deal, just something simple for myself. I also enjoyed having Sensei eat the meals I prepared.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s good, maybe?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei seemed unsure how to react.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I get more motivated when there’s someone else’s reaction involved, rather than just cooking for myself. But please don’t expect every meal to be so moving that it makes you cry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Forget about the crying!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It seems it was quite an embarrassing incident for her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As for me, I was glad I could see this rare side of Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei. Just like you, now that I know, I just can’t remain indifferent. If work is tough, I at least want you to eat properly. If you push yourself too hard and break down, it’ll be even harder to recover.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Neglecting one’s physical and mental health is counterproductive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rather than worrying half-heartedly, it’s easier for me to just help out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s a really tempting offer, but no.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei regretfully declines.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The effort to cook for one or two is about the same.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Having a student take care of my meals is definitely going too far.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, you’ve already eaten my cooking, seen crying and sleep here. Moreover, we’ve spent a night together in the same room, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to shake her up a bit with my suggestive wording.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, watch how you say that!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it too late to be shy or pretend now? Our relationship as neighbors is only until you move out.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s still April. There’s nearly three months until the end of the first term.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The woman in front of me looks troubled as if feeling guilty.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve been helping my mother since I was little, so I’m used to household chores.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Until my mother remarried, I used to cook dinner to make her happy when she came home.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not doubting your cooking skills, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just can’t leave a working woman exhausted like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, I almost fall for you, Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei covers her mouth with her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mind if you fall for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s a joke. But being there for someone in need is super attractive to a woman.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, you agree to my suggestion, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not fair to leave everything to you. How about we take turns?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ll definitely get worried if you can’t do it. Increasing your work is counterproductive.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">For better or worse, she’s stubborn, so I gently chide her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ugh, you see right through me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If Sensei gets more tired and the quality of your lessons drops, that’s a big loss for the students.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s too much for you to do it alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just part of my household chores, so it’s no problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can manage both too… I think.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The fact that she hesitates shows she’s an honest person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s stubborn, but it’s obvious that trying to do more is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her quality of life has plummeted, evident from her crying over simple curry rice. Pushing herself further is impractical.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What she really lacks is time for herself, including rest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I take over some household chores, Sensei can use her time for things she enjoys.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Your personal life is in shambles because you can’t do that now. The added mental strain of your neighbor being a student and the upcoming move. Helping someone in that situation isn’t wrong.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I list objective facts, trying to convince her.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“But I’m an adult.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay for a child to help an adult.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her face, which had been looking for an excuse to refuse, lifts.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, you’re already doing your best as a first-time homeroom teacher, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I see her striving earnestly in the classroom every day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A wise adult knows how to cut corners here and there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei was still holding her head, deep in thought.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Adults should have pride, but isn’t it okay to take a rest where you can? Humans can’t always be pushing themselves. Use me to secure some time to take care of yourself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I desperately wish I had that kind of time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her eyes wavered.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if you’re a working adult, please let me support you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Perhaps moved by my words, Tenjō-sensei took a deep breath and fixed her gaze on me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You really have a way of spoiling people, the kind that makes them useless.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I tilted my head.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you being spoiled, Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s, well…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei stumbled over her words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what will you do? Even if you refuse now, I’ll still bring you meals. I can tell when you come home by the noise.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The building’s soundproofing isn’t perfect, so it’s easy to be aware of the other’s living rhythm if one pays attention.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll report it to the landlord as harassment from a neighbor.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Despite her words of reluctance, her expression was calm.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then it’ll be revealed that I’m a student at the same high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That student is threatening me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That sounds terrible. Where else would you find a student so concerned about his Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just one step away from a crime scene, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you really hate it, I won’t force you. The choice is yours, Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And also leaving the decision to a woman…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, is it okay for me to decide? But if I decide, you’ll have to follow it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I have no real power to enforce anything, but Sensei closed her eyes, seriously wrestling with the decision.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I silently enjoyed the sight of the beautiful teacher’s face twisted in agony.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As always, she’s a woman whose every expression is picturesque.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could probably watch the many faces of Reiyu Tenjō forever without getting bored.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;! at least let me pay for all the ingredients!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She shouted this after much deliberation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That doesn’t make sense. I’ll pay for half of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can I split the bill with someone younger who lives off their parents’ money! I’ll pay more, including the cost of ingredients, gas, and labor. I won’t budge on this. Got it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With that said, I had no reason to argue.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright. Is it okay to settle at the end of the month? I’ll keep all the receipts.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m willing to pay whatever you ask.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t you worry that I might charge too much and keep some for myself?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I trust you more than that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She returned my sudden suggestion with a straightforward expression of gratitude.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, please take care of me from now on.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei bowed earnestly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Also, there’s one thing I’d like to change about having meals made for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She raised her head, and now it was Sensei’s turn to make a suggestion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s stop calling me Sensei at home. This isn’t school, so let’s take it easy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that’s the case, I’ll call you Tenjō-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. For me… calling you Nishiki-kun is the same as at school. Then Yuunagi-kun it is. Oh, I kind of like saying your name.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought I had gotten used to being in the same space&mdash;&mdash;I was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she flashed an innocent smile towards me, my heart was easily captured.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She called me by my first name.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It felt completely different from being called Yuunagi by family or friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The ticklish feeling and the special feeling made my heart jump with joy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This is bad, I’m getting too happy&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before my face could break into a grin, I said, ‘I’ll take the dishes,’ and started stacking the empty plates.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can do that much.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san hurriedly reached out, and our hands overlapped.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, sorry!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san quickly withdrew her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No problem.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I barely managed not to drop the dishes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Let me do the cleaning up when I can. I feel bad for falling asleep like yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Does that mean you’ll come to eat in my room from now on?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This time, she came to my room just to discuss the neighbor’s issue.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was planning to pack what I made into containers and share it with her, thinking it would be bad to have her always come over to my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san’s face turned red.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“S-sorry! Considering the preparation and washing up, I thought it would save you trouble if I came to eat! I guess it would be a bother if I come every night!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san waved her hands frantically, desperately trying to explain.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m sorry for the misunderstanding. It’s no problem to eat in my room! It’s not a bother at all! Feel free to come over, morning or night!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was natural for Sensei to think that way, having eaten in my room twice already.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re going to prepare not just dinner but breakfast too!? Isn’t that too much?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be up at the same time anyway, so please come over to eat. If it’s just eating, you can make time in the morning, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even five minutes in the morning are precious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if we leave at the same time, women need to wake up earlier than men due to the time taken for makeup and other preparations.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…are you sure it’s okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it’s better when it’s warm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. I prefer that too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And so we specifically discussed the rules concerning our living arrangements.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, doesn’t this give me too many benefits?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not fine! Let’s make it more of a mutual help in a broader sense.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thus, the agreed-upon rules, known as the Neighbor Agreement, are as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Clause 1: The fact that we are neighbors is a secret just between the two of us.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Clause 2: In times of trouble, we help each other without hesitation.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Clause 3: Yuunagi Nishiki will prepare breakfast and dinner on weekdays. Reiyu Tenjō will contribute more to the food expenses.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Clause 4: The Neighbor Agreement can be terminated upon request by either party.】</p>
<p class="calibre4">【Clause 5: Additional rules can be decided upon as necessary through discussion.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">As of now, these five points are the basic terms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, let’s exchange private contact information for when something comes up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Finally, Tenjō-san said this and took out her smartphone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, is that okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There are times when I won’t need meals due to meetings and such. It’s better to inform in advance, but I can’t exactly tell you directly at school. It’s also useful in case of any emergencies.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can also ask you when I can’t think of a dinner menu.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are we a newlywed couple?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san laughed holding her stomach.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s hard to think of a menu every time, so it would help if you could tell me your food requests.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you have such a wide variety of dishes?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt a little intimidated when faced with such looks of respect.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just refer to recipe sites.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No problem. Just eating new dishes on the menu is enough to make me happy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, Reiyu Tenjō was added to my LINE.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just seeing her name displayed on my smartphone screen gave me a mysterious emotion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now that we could contact each other anytime, I wondered what kind of message I should send.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I send something weird and am secretly thought of as creepy, I’d feel like dying.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What should I do? I don’t know what the appropriate message content is.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Should I start with a normal greeting? But that seems roundabout.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Is it better to go straight to the point in this case?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Should I use formal language? How much are emojis acceptable?</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was confused, a message came from her first.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san sent a stamp of a rabbit character saying ‘yoroshiku ne’ right away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, I don’t need to think too hard and should just send messages casually.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My anxiety quickly dissipated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was right in front of me, but I sent back a similar stamp.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so, my and Tenjō-san’s neighborly relationship officially began.</p>

<p class="calibre4">True to the words ‘strike while the iron is hot,’ Tenjō-san was quick to act once the Neighbor Agreement was settled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She brought strawberries to my room to make jam and then said, ‘I’ll go to the bakery,’ and left on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I also stood in the kitchen, simmering a large amount of strawberries in a pot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the sweet aroma filled the room, Tenjō-san returned, having bought more than just bread.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mmmh, it smells sweet and nice. Here, this is the deli bread and these are savory filled breads. I also bought scones, so let’s spread the jam on them and eat them right away. Can you boil some water for tea?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With her suggestion, it turned into an afternoon tea time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scones Tenjō-san bought were firm and crunchy, pairing well with the jam.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we talked over tea, the jam cooled down enough for us to start bottling it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The kitchen was small, so standing side by side, our shoulders almost bumped into each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s surprising how little the strawberries are left after being simmered down. Jam is such a luxurious food.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san seemed very happy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the day turned to evening, she came back with the freshly laundered bed covers.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I think they’re clean now. Should I help you put them on?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can do it myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a thank you for making the jam.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ve already received bread, so it’s fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be shy. I’ve been able to move around since morning, and it feels good to have a long day.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And so, she began making the bed on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It must be like this to have an actual sister.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today, Tenjō-san seemed to have found the right distance to maintain at home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was more casual and personal than the friendliness she showed to everyone at school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">…But still.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san was on my bed, on all fours.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was carefully covering the bed to avoid wrinkles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, the sight of her back in that position was bothering me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I know I shouldn’t, but I wanted to see it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, done! …Hm, why did you turn your face away?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I-it’s just your imagination…Sorry for the trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just fixed what I had messed up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed satisfied with her work and headed towards the entrance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thanks for everything. I’m looking forward to breakfast starting Monday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, me too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I watched her return to her room, then went to lock my own door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, Tenjō-san popped her head back in.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did you forget something?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I asked, Tenjō-san grinned and threw a teasing question at me after a pause.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, are you a butt fetishist?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please ignore it if you’ve noticed!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But I felt your gaze.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Having a big one is a good thing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I decided to be bold.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re at that age, huh? Naughty.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not about that. Even if it’s not puberty, Tenjō-san is attractive as a person. It’s natural to be attracted to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t make excuses. Because it’s the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her appeal wasn’t limited to her being the opposite sex; her bright aura, dazzling smile, and her entire being felt special to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“W-what are you saying!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With her long hair fluttering, she hurried back to her room next door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As Reiyu Tenjō left my room, I felt a loneliness like waking from a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ah, today was a fun holiday for me&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder when was the last time I spent a holiday with someone.</p>

<p class="calibre3">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">Monday morning dawned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As usual, I woke up to the sound of the alarm from the room next door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My neighbor and teacher, Reiyu Tenjō, is not a morning person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like every other day, the alarm didn’t stop immediately today, and after it finally did, another sound would soon follow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This had been the routine on weekday mornings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sent a message from my smartphone to Sensei, who must still be fighting sleepiness in bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Yuunagi: Good morning, Tenjō-san.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Are you coming over for breakfast?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m making fried eggs, so please let me know if you have a preference for how they’re cooked.】</p>

<p class="calibre4">After getting ready for the day, I returned to my room, hearing the alarm from next door for what seemed like the umpteenth time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">As I changed from my pajamas into my uniform, the alarm stopped quickly this time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, unusually early today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I stood in the kitchen, a message notification came from my phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">【Reiyu: Good morning, Yuunagi-kun!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sorry for the noise so early!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Please make the fried eggs runny!】</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but smile at the lively text early in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Energized by such exchanges, I started preparing breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the time I had two servings of food ready on the table, the doorbell of my room rang.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I found myself gasping.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There stood Reiyu Tenjō in work mode, her hair neatly done and makeup applied, right in front of my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s like, well, she’s in an idling state before gearing up for the day, ready to give her best.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A rare expression, somewhere between her work and private life, as she’s in the process of raising her spirits.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuunagi-kun? What’s wrong, you’re spacing out?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Seeing Tenjō-san this early in the morning in her precious moments before going to school is a feast for the eyes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“? I don’t have much time, so I’m coming in.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Says Tenjō-san as she quickly enters my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san puts down her bag and sits at the table, yet she doesn’t start eating her breakfast.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s so good to be able to have a meal in the morning. What’s really needed in life is leisure, after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed somewhat moved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today’s breakfast was a classic menu: toast with homemade strawberry jam, fried eggs and sausages, salad, and soup.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Come on, Yuunagi-kun, sit down too. We’re going to eat together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She says while patting the seat next to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you can start eating first. I was thinking of making some coffee.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Milk is enough. Come on.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She beckons me hurriedly, so I sit down too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, itadakimasu!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san waits for me before she starts eating.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The fried eggs are perfectly runny. It’s amazing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How would you like it seasoned? Soy sauce, salt and pepper, or ketchup?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Soy sauce, of course!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Same for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I say, placing the tabletop soy sauce in front of Tenjō-san.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mmm, this creamy yolk is great. And the jam Yuunagi-kun made is really the best. Jam toast after such a long time feels nostalgic and delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I agree. I wonder when was the last time I had it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re amazing for cooking in the morning! The deli bread I bought would have been enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s no way I’d skimp on the first day after we’ve gone to the trouble of making a Neighbor Agreement. Besides, that deli bread is my lunch for today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that enough for you? You should eat more.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I usually have lunch at the school store or convenience store, so this is actually an upgrade. You still seem to struggle with mornings, Tenjō-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No-no, if I’ve promised you, I’ll definitely come to eat!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought you might not make it in time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know, like how you sleep in usually but wake up early on trips. You don’t want to miss the hotel’s breakfast buffet, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I get that feeling.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right? It was worth getting up this morning. Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san enjoyed the ordinary breakfast but finished it in no time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll go ahead then. Sorry I can’t help with the cleanup. See you at school.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, have a good day.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;It’s nice to be seen off at home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san says with a smile and heads to the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought this busy morning scene wasn’t too bad either.</p>

<p class="calibre3">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, everyone!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei, entering the classroom of 2-C, greets everyone with a clear voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looks around the classroom, full of energy from the morning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s so sunny this morning, feels almost like summer. The UV rays seem intense. You guys better put on sunscreen as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Saying this, Sensei takes off her jacket, revealing a sleeveless knit underneath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her slender shoulders and white arms extend gracefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō stands so beautifully, it’s mesmerizing. She would be even more attractive in a swimsuit.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Since Tenjō-sensei became the advisor, I’ve heard that the number of students trying out for the swim team increased just to see Sensei in a swimsuit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I would like to see Sensei in a swimsuit too if I could.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, class representatives, please lead the command.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At the call to stand up, I rise from my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since entering the classroom, Tenjō-sensei hasn’t looked my way once.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even as I stand up in front of her, our eyes don’t meet; she always talks while looking over the entire classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I should learn from her thoroughness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I need to tighten up, having been a bit carried away knowing a bit about Sensei’s private life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">To keep our secret and adhere to our Neighbor agreement, we must strictly maintain the line between public and private.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After sitting down, Sensei takes attendance as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Next, Yuuna──, Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just when I was impressed, Tenjō-sensei almost slipped up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was close! You haven’t called me by my first name long enough to get used to it, have you?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I respond as if nothing happened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t react strangely here and arouse suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Glancing up, I see Tenjō-sensei’s eyes saying, ‘That was close, but still safe.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">After calling all the classmates’ names, she notes, “I see, Kuhouin-san is still not here,” looking towards the window-side desk where the habitual latecomer should be sitting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The door of class 2-C suddenly opens, and the rumored girl student enters leisurely.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Today, I’m safe.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira Kuhouin walks up to the teacher’s desk without a greeting, her voice listless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Last year, she kept her hair short to not interfere with sports, giving her a boyish look. Now, it had grown to her shoulders.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She wore her uniform loosely, with a cardigan tied around her waist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The top buttons of her shirt were undone, and her skirt seemed unusually short, likely because of her long legs. Her thighs are solidly thick, a remnant of the training from their time in the track and field club.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her large eyes were half-closed, perhaps from sleepiness, giving her an air of ennui that oddly exuded a decadent allure.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The once athletic girl has become completely lethargic since her retirement due to injury.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuhouin-san, late again. Why were you late again today?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My bed wouldn’t let me go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was too brazen to call it an excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Challenging Tenjō-sensei like that took guts. She’s not your average pretty girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If you snap at Sensei without cause, you risk being seen as envious of her beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, one would play it safe and not make such a risky move.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Kuhouin showed no hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it confidence in herself, or is she just being reckless?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akira Kuhouin was also considered one of the most beautiful girls in our grade.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even in her sporty phase last year, she was secretly popular, but it increased significantly after she became more feminine following her retirement.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Set your alarm to wake up in time for homeroom.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei stops Kuhouin, who was about to head to her seat and reminds her of the obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In front of the blackboard&mdash;right in front of me&mdash;the two faced each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m in a mutual love with my bed, so I want to stay with it forever.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuhouin-san, even if you love it, there are times you must part. If you keep being late, you might not be able to advance to the third year. You need to change your attitude.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei advised her quietly, clearly worried about the possibility of Kuhouin repeating a year.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll worry about that when the time comes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin showed no concern or agitation about her own issues, seemingly indifferent.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s not how it works.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do as you like. Even when I’m an adult, I won’t love school enough to wake up early every day, unlike Sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin probably meant it as sarcasm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But knowing Reiyu Tenjō’s morning situation, I couldn’t help but burst out a small chuckle.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki, did something funny happen?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin narrowed her eyes and stared at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was surprised she even remembered my name. Sensei also looked at me, her face seeming like she wanted to say something.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, bad timing. My hay fever is acting up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I lied casually.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That wasn’t a sneeze. Plus, you had a stupid look on your face.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She giggles softly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Kuhouin. You’re late and now you’re dissing someone’s face first thing in the morning?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Being picked on just for sitting in the front row is the last thing I need.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If you’re late, at least show some remorse and enter from the back of the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why do you have to pass in front of me?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I only commented on your expression. No comment on the face itself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That makes it even more annoying!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, yeah, Mr. Handsome.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s too perfunctory.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not at all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Our eyes met.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if her eyes were drawing me in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She suddenly fell silent, stopping our back-and-forth conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was she actually interested in me and just covering it up with teasing me?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wow, you’re blushing. Don’t take a girl’s words too seriously, or you’ll be seen as a delusional guy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mind your own business, you chronic latecomer.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I made it in time for the first period, though.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">‘So it’s not tardiness,’ Kuhouin casually retorted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Standing next to Sensei at the front of the classroom, her brazenness was almost refreshing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In general, not being in the classroom before homeroom is considered tardiness. Look, everyone else made it on time, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I reminded her of a rule we learned in elementary school, urging Kuhouin to look around the classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Everyone’s so early, that’s amazing…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin said in a listless voice, almost mocking the other classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Watching our exchange, Tenjō-sensei next to me was somehow holding back laughter, her hand covering her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could sense her trying to suppress her giggles, almost bending over with laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could understand if she was angry, but what was so funny?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Confused by her reaction, I had to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin also frowned in puzzlement.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, sorry-sorry. Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei returned to a serious expression and faced Kuhouin again.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“For now, take your seat as the first period is about to start. If your tardiness continues, I’ll have to lecture you in the staff room or call your parents.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei concluded with that warning and ended the morning homeroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hmm, I still don’t understand why Sensei was holding back laughter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ll ask her when I get home.</p>

<p class="calibre3">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m home!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was past nine at night again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Working overtime from Monday, that’s dedication.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The intercom of my room rang, and when I opened the door, Tenjō-sensei was there in a good mood.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, welcome back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her assertive greeting made me reflexively respond in kind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, it’s nice to come back to a lit room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sensei&mdash;no, Tenjō-san. You just said ‘I’m home’…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is it weird? It’s almost like coming home. Ah, I’m tired.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san took off her shoes and entered my room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Your room is next door, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry about the details. Here, I brought you something.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just like this morning, Tenjō-san came to my room for dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She pulled out some convenience store sweets from her work bag and handed them to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you going to change first? I don’t mind waiting.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Instead of stopping by her room first, she came directly here still in her suit.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t want to keep you waiting.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t need to worry about me or bring gifts.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just convenience store sweets. Besides, the convenience store on the way home is an oasis for the working adult’s heart.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s an exclusive space for busy, tired workers to take a break on their way home. A place to reward themselves for a day’s hard work. In my case, I just end up wanting something sweet.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I see, so shopping on the way home is a bit of a breather.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“And you chose cream puffs and pudding.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have to check out the new products. You can pick whichever you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Won’t you gain weight if you eat sweets after dinner?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I swam a lot today, so no problem! Besides, dessert goes to a different stomach!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san took off her jacket and confidently flashed a peace sign at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems she feels no guilt about having sweets at night.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Being the advisor of the swim team, she probably uses her regular swimming as a justification.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing her body, it’s understandable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then please chill it. I’m going to wash my hands.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After entrusting me with the sweets, Tenjō-san disappeared into the washroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be tactless to criticize Tenjō-san’s small pleasures.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After putting the sweets in the fridge, I turned on the stove to finish cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Being a teacher is busy and tough, I thought to myself again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the morning, they go to school and stand at the podium teaching all day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the evening, they move their bodies to coach club activities.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then back to the staff room for paperwork. By the time work ends, they must be exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Going out after work would require a lot of energy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Their daily schedule is packed, and unexpected troubles can arise when dealing with teenagers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin’s habit of being late is a perfect example.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If it’s not corrected, it could significantly change a student’s life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While some can easily say it’s the student’s responsibility, it’s difficult for a conscientious teacher like Reiyu Tenjō.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I found myself wondering if there was anything else I could do to ease Tenjō-san’s burdens.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what’s for dinner tonight?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She returned humming a tune, peeking over my shoulder at what I was doing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re too close.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When she leaned in to look, her hands naturally rested on my shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt a sudden warmth in my left shoulder where she touched.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“These room hallways are narrow, you know. It’s not my fault.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With furniture and appliances like shelves and a fridge, the hallway is just wide enough for two people to walk side by side.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s inevitable for a reasonably priced one-room apartment in Tokyo to be cramped.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can’t you ask me from a distance?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just wanted to see a guy skillfully handling a frying pan up close.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Unfortunately, it’s just a simple task of reheating. And please don’t play around near the fire.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san’s hands left my shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her behavior seemed even more relaxed than in the morning. She really seems to feel at home here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It looks like I’m the only one who’s tense.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you in high spirits today?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Coming home to a warm dinner is something unimaginable for someone living alone. My steps on the way home were lighter than usual.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then it’s worth cooking for you, Tenjō-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry, I’m starving. I’ll devour whatever you make.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She proudly rubbed her flat stomach with a smug look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Does that mean you’ll eat it even if it’s bad?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, the opposite. That means I trust your cooking.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her cute gesture made me like her even more.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll bring it now, so please sit and wait.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can help too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then please serve the rice. The bowls are in that shelf. Serve as much as you like. I’ll have a normal portion.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Did you wait especially for me? Aren’t you starving, Yuunagi-kun?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her cheerful face from before vanished when she realized I hadn’t had dinner yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san’s expression turned to one of concern.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was just late in cooking. I went shopping at the supermarket after school, then took a nap. Plus, I’ve been tasting it along the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“From now on, you can eat whenever you’re hungry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I’m hungry, I will.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re equals here, so you don’t have to be so formal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I also want to see Sensei’s reaction directly. Today’s menu is a new challenge for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I carefully watch the simmered fish being reheated to prevent it from burning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh~, I like your courage to try something new instead of sticking to your specialties.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san smiles, showing her white teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I appreciate her lively and positive reactions.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I would never cook simmered fish just for myself, so I thought I’d give it a try.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tonight’s dinner is a Japanese menu: rice, miso soup, simmered fish, rolled omelet, and boiled spinach.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We carry the food to the table and eat dinner together.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, were you holding back laughter this morning when I was talking with Kuhouin?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, yes. I was trying not to laugh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Was there something funny?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s just that watching Kuhouin-san reminded me of myself as a teenager.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Was the young Tenjō-san like that, so edgy?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“When I was a teenager, everything around me was annoying. I had a period when I was always in a bad mood and rebellious against adults, so I understand the feeling. It felt nostalgic and somewhat embarrassing, you know～”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She squirms as if embarrassed to put it into words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s hard to imagine that from the bright, beautiful, and kind Onee-san image.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s unexpected.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even so, I was seriously troubled and suffering back then. Now I can laugh at my immaturity. It’s like having my high school yearbook opened right in front of me, and I just couldn’t help but laugh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What a torturous teenage flashback.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I became a teacher because I wanted to be an adult who could guide such lost youths in their adolescence.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s great that you can use your own experiences.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s nice to have an adult nearby who understands the pain and suffering of others.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“At your age, people tend to say harsh things defensively to keep others at a distance. As a homeroom teacher, I’d appreciate it if Yuunagi-kun could help Kuhouin-san as a classmate if she’s in trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If there’s any way I can help, I will.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san smiles contentedly at my response.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you. Kids like her are particularly easily moved by casual kindness.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-san, you speak with such conviction.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I am also someone who gratefully enjoys my neighbor’s cooking. It’s delicious today as well. Thank you for the meal.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san ate everything neatly again today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After finishing the meal, she offered to do the dishes, saying, ‘I’ll take care of the cleanup.’</p>

<p class="calibre4">With her long hair tied back, she dons my apron and stands in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I lie down on the bed for a rest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though I’m the owner of the room, should I really let my teacher wash the dishes?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I tried to refuse Sensei’s offer several times, but she insisted.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Fiddling with my smartphone, I can’t help but watch her from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if living together feels like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I indulge in such sweet daydreams, my phone’s ringtone echoes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A phone call? Don’t worry, go ahead and answer it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san continues to rinse the dishes without turning around.</p>

<p class="calibre4">My phone vibrates with the call.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The name displayed on the screen is Kaguya Nishiki.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I flip the phone over as if to hide it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s nothing to worry about, I’m fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But it’s still ringing. I’ve just finished the dishes, so I’ll keep quiet.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san brings over the sweets she bought from the fridge.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I usually don’t answer calls from this person.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…If I’m in the way, I can go back to my room.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please, feel free to stay and have your dessert here.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The smartphone continues to ring.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is it a call from your family, perhaps?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re as sharp as ever.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re always so open, the only thing I can think of is that it must be a family matter.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There should be courtesy even among close friends, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry. I just couldn’t help but notice.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Finally, the ringing stops.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s nothing for Tenjō-san to worry about. Let’s have dessert instead.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While brewing tea after the meal, we share the sweets Tenjō-san bought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We continue to chat about trivial things while watching TV.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Let me have a bite of your pudding too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, we’re sharing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I bought it, so it’s fine, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I thought it was a gift for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What catches my interest, catches my interest.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s pushy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s normal among girls.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m a guy, just so you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t eat it with any excitement if you say something like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-san’s cheeks flushed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wanting to eat it even though you’re embarrassed huh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but laugh. In my mind, Reiyu Tenjō has completely become a character who’s always hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But this honesty was becoming increasingly endearing to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was happy that she showed me her natural reactions and vulnerabilities that she doesn’t reveal at school, and I feel a bit proud to be someone who can support her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Moreover, even when nothing much is happening, just idly spending time with her after meals was fun.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the end, she happily ate my pudding with a bite.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Perhaps this kind of unremarkable everyday life is what people call happiness.</p>
