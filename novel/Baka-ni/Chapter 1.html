<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stood before a city surrounded by enormous walls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its name was “Adventure City Lunot”. The reason for such a moniker was that it was the city with the highest population of adventurers in the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito slightly bowed and thanked Nao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for accompanying me all the way here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t mention it. You’ve helped us in more ways than one&#8230;I can make a proper report to father now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;? Father…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, it’s nothing&#8230;forget it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s father, the previous king, was supposed to already be dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis, the “manager” of this world, told Reito that the father who had exiled him also took Nao under his protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started thinking quietly, then Nao shook her head and changed the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyway&#8230;I think you have talent. With your strength and knowledge, you will surely become a fine adventurer.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-20184230' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-20184230' data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0iYWktYXR0cmlidXRlcyIgc3R5bGU9InBvc2l0aW9uOiByZWxhdGl2ZTsiPgo8c3BhbiBjbGFzcz0nYWktY2hlY2stYmxvY2sgYWktY2ZwJyBkYXRhLWFpLWJsb2NrPSc5JyBkYXRhLWFpLWNmcC10aW1lPScxJz48L3NwYW4+CjwvZGl2Pgo8c2NyaXB0IGFzeW5jIHNyYz0iaHR0cHM6Ly9wYWdlYWQyLmdvb2dsZXN5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmNvbS9wYWdlYWQvanMvYWRzYnlnb29nbGUuanM/Y2xpZW50PWNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGNyb3Nzb3JpZ2luPSJhbm9ueW1vdXMiPjwvc2NyaXB0Pgo8IS0tIEJsb2NrIDkuMSAtIERpc3BsYXkgQWZ0ZXIgcGFyYWdyYXBoIDAuMSAtLT4KPGlucyBjbGFzcz0iYWRzYnlnb29nbGUiCiAgICAgc3R5bGU9ImRpc3BsYXk6YmxvY2siCiAgICAgZGF0YS1hZC1jbGllbnQ9ImNhLXB1Yi02NjA5NDQyMzM4MDgwMTE2IgogICAgIGRhdGEtYWQtc2xvdD0iNjQ2MDkxNjYyMyIKICAgICBkYXRhLWFkLWZvcm1hdD0iYXV0byI+PC9pbnM+CjxzY3JpcHQ+CiAgICAgKGFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlID0gd2luZG93LmFkc2J5Z29vZ2xlIHx8IFtdKS5wdXNoKHt9KTsKPC9zY3JpcHQ+' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, it all depends on you. Make sure you don’t lose the proof of identity I gave you, all right? You’ll need it to work anywhere. Take care of yourself&#8230;you too, Ullr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes&#8230;thank you very much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Nao shook hands and parted before the city gates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valkyrja knights intended to return to the royal capital. They had to report about the band of goblins who attacked the village as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, riding last behind the Valkyrjas as they left, turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Goodbye!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for everything!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wooof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, looking at Nao disappear into the distance, felt nervous. He had lived by himself in the forest for a long time: it was his first time in a city too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soldiers guarding the gate called him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, you&#8230;those were the Valkyrja knights, right!? What’s your connection with them!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t believe my eyes&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;excuse me, can you let me in&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, rather displeased with their approach, showed the proof of identity received from Nao. The document was proof that the kingdom’s first princess vouched for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guards went wide-eyed and hurriedly saluted him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our deepest apologies, milord!! P-please, you may pass freely!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A wonderful day to you, milord!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, thank you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito successfully entered the city, but something else worried him: Ullr’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a monster into town would definitely attract attention, he thought.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly enough, however, tamed monsters were pretty common in the city: they were used as horses, to pull carriages and luggage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, look&#8230;isn’t that a White Wolf?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!! Did that boy tame it!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look at that glossy fur&#8230;how much do you think it’d be worth?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rare species like the White Wolf Ullr was an uncommon sight even in the city. Reito and his partner thus attracted the attention of many unsavory types.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrr&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quiet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito admonished the growling Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of a way to protect him, Reito started looking for lodging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They eventually arrived at a street dotted with open-air stalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey boy!! Yes, you! Come taste our Horned Rabbit skewers!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cute doggie, you’d love this smoked Orc meat, wouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a cute young man and puppy we have here&#8230;won’t you play with me a bit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Reito’s “Detect Presence” activated. It meant that someone with hostile intentions was approaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately contacted Airis, the world’s “manager”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Someone has been following you. Their target is probably Ullr.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Are they thieves?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Apparently so. There are also wanted criminals among them. If you want to take them out, I would suggest turning left into that alley. Conveniently, there’s an empty lot. There』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, following Airis’ advice, turned into the alley together with Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could have used the skill “Leap” to jump on the roof of a building and run away, but decided to fight when he heard that there were wanted criminals among his pursuers: he needed money to cover his future travel expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here we are&#8230;Ullr, get ready to fight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used “Detect Presence” and confirmed that the hostile presences were approaching. The two alleged thieves followed Reito inside the alley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hee hee hee&#8230;looks like we’ve been found&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That makes things simpler. Hey, boy!! Give us that wolf and scram!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two men appeared, carrying pirate cutlasses on their backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They approached Reito, slowly but surely — but he perceived a more dangerous presence behind them. A woman was standing on the roof of a building, observing the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She probably realized that Reito detected her presence: the woman suddenly jumped down from the roof. The moment she landed, a tremor shook the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman was rather short, roughly the size of a child, but her appearance suggested she was middle-aged. Both her hands were equipped with daggers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her muscular body, despite her short stature, suggested that she might be a Dwarf. She seemed to weigh at least 100 kilos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you with them too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman ignored Reito’s question as she walked closer, a grin on her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the two thieves saw her, they started shaking immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what!? Why&#8230;why are you here!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is bad, boss!!! I saw the bounty before, that’s Mira the Ripper!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two men, their faces pale as death, started slowly moving backward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr was in maximum alert mode, his hair standing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRRROWL!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Easy, doggie, I don’t have any business with you, just these guys here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman named Mira then lowered her waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment— </span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-58214742' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-58214742' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-please wait!! What did we even— ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shut your filthy mouth, now!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira’s daggers flew from her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were shot, straight and true, through the men’s throats, piercing them just like bullets. The two men slumped down to the ground and died, without even a whimper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira then spat words full of spite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmph, acting like you didn’t spread rumors about me, saying I slept with goddamn Simon of all people&#8230;anyway. It’s your turn now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira’s eyes turned towards Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, shocked to see people killed in front of his eyes, couldn’t make his legs move. Ullr stepped forward, to protect him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira took out a small bag from her breast pocket and tossed it at Ullr’s feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time to say goodnight!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get away, Ullr!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito finally got a hold of himself and jumped away, while Ullr leaped in the opposite direction. When the small bag hit the ground, a cloud of blue smoke puffed out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito immediately contacted Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ai-Ai!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s new, I’m a panda now? Don’t call me like that again, I even liked it a little. Anyway, that small bag contains powder from Slumbergrass. If you breathe it even a little, you will be knocked out for at least half a day.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito cut off the communication and looked in Mira’s direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman was nowhere to be seen, however. Time was supposed to stop during Reito and Airis’ communication, but she had somehow vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito used “Detect Presence” and found her behind himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He took the bow he carried on his back and threw it at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira was about to strike Reito with the cutlass she carried at her waist but had to quickly use it to deflect the bow that suddenly flew at her instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated “Leap” to put more distance between himself and his enemy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira, impressed, whistled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those movements&#8230;you’re an assassin too? Not half bad, boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was raised by an assassin, yes&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word “assassin” made Reito think about Aria. He had learned the “Leap” skill while running away from her, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking of going on the offensive, Reito created ice longswords with both of his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice swords…? Tch, so you’re a magic-user.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growl!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira clicked her tongue at the sight of the ice swords. At the same time, Ullr pounced her, his fangs bared to strike. Her cutlass, however, was faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You stay back!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s fangs and Mira’s cutlass clashed: eventually, she won the power struggle and tossed Ullr away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to have enough muscular power to easily blow away the White Wolf, despite the fact that his current size was close to that of a horse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was wary of his foe, but knew he had to attack: he charged Mira with his Iceclad Swords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? What’s the plan here, boy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira frowned as she easily dodged Reito’s attack. He continued to attack, however, in a furious frenzy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shaah!! Haah!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your speed with the sword isn’t bad, but&#8230;could it be that you’ve never fought another person!?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira dodged Reito’s swords once again, circled in front of him, and kicked him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito managed to parry the kick with his arm, but, despite the “Break Fall” and “Resilience” skills, he couldn’t endure the impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was blown backward, as Mira laughed heartily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha, this is rich!! I saw those ice swords and thought I was going to have it rough, but&#8230;you’ve only fought monsters until now, haven’t you? Even beginner adventurers can handle a sword better than that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh&#8230;can’t deny that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, breathing heavily, clenched his teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Mira said was indeed true: he had plenty of battle experience against monsters, but very little against other human beings. Excluding the sparring matches against Aria, he had only fought against a trio of thieves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You got to use your hips more, boy!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrowl&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Told you to stay out of this, doggie!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr tried to jump between Reito and Mira, but she moved first and dodged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White Wolf Ullr was definitely faster than her, but she was apparently more skilled as a fighter. She saw through Ullr’s attacks completely and dodged effortlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito imagined that, while one of Mira’s jobs had to be “Assassin”, the other was surely “Swordsman” or “Martial Artist”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just her cutlass, Mira could deliver attacks faster and heavier than Reito with two swords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whirlwind!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Battle Art with both swords, but Mira deftly shifted her upper body out of the way. From that stance, she took the dagger hanging from her waist and threw it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene of the thieves’ demise at Mira’s hands flashed in his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito crouched to dodge the dagger and Mira smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You fell for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;string?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threads indeed stretched from Mira’s fingers. They were ted to the dagger’s handle: when she clenched her fist, the flying dagger changed trajectory, heading straight towards Reito’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Battle Art “Spin Strike”, which had a wider range of attack than “Whirlwind”, and literally spun on his axis and deflected the dagger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The threads attached to the dagger’s handle were forcefully ripped off, consequently digging into Mira’s fingers and twisting her face in pain. The dwarven woman then angrily grabbed her cutlass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You little brat!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated “Observing Eye” on the cutlass swung towards him and managed to calmly see its path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira was pretending to swing it from the front, while she planned to change the trajectory, as she did with the dagger. Just before she changed the cutlass’ path to stab Reito in the neck, he dodged with precision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time for payback!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira, surprised to see her attack dodged so easily, could not dodge Reito’s kick into her stomach: the same attack she had used on him a little while before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira, taken by surprise by the unexpected weight of Reito’s kick, retreated and coughed heavily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kah, wheeze&#8230;you damn brat…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira was too furious to think clearly: she swung her cutlass again from the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believing her sword skills to be superior to Reito, she had become arrogant: on the other hand, Reito thought he couldn’t win if he faced her head-on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito let go of his two Iceclad Swords and thrust his arms forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice Shield!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whuah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had learned this Craft Skill during his life in the Abyssal Forest: as the name said, it used “Ice Block” to create a shield made of ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large shield created by Reito repelled Mira’s cutlass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito took advantage of the opening in Mira’s guard: he let go of the shield and created another weapon.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-45618107' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-45618107' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That again…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not create longswords like before, but a massive broadsword. It was easily longer than Reito was tall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira’s instincts warned that the situation was getting dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, wait a— ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito ignored Mira’s words and unleashed the rotating slash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira knew she wouldn’t be able to block it, so she used the “Leap” skill to jump backward, out of the sword’s range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rraaahhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;.!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gust of wind raised by the slash, however, blew her away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successfully moving outside the sword’s range had made her feel safe, but the feeling did not last long: Reito was coming closer, still spinning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!? That can’t&#8230;gwah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito continued spinning and accelerating, finally reaching Mira.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman’s cutlass was shattered as she was blown away again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwaaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoops&#8230;that was close.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stopped the rotation. Still a bit unsteady on his feet, he looked at Mira, sprawled on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not make the broadsword vibrate, as he had done against the Blood Bears, so Mira’s body was not severed. She had definitely suffered considerable damage, however, as her muscles twitched. She had completely lost consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind her defeat was that she thought Reito was just a novice swordsman. Had she observed his abilities more thoroughly, without losing her cool, she could have probably won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito tied up Mira, then called Airis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ai-Fi?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh…? Oh, is it a pun on Wi-Fi? A bit forced, you know..』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『More importantly, this person was really strong&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Of course. She has 15 gold coins on her head, after all.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『15 gold coins!? Which means&#8230;1.5 million yen!?』(*Note: approx. 14,250.00 USD)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was shocked by the incredible amount of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mira’s strength sufficiently justified her bounty, though. Reito managed to win because she underestimated him and “Spin Strike” worked well, but if they fought again there was no guarantee he’d win: that’s how superior she was to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You could have told me that she was this tough&#8230;I almost died.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Well, you didn’t, and you won, all’s well that ends well. Spin Strike served you well, didn’t it?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, but&#8230;I made that skill to defeat opponents with large bodies. It’s not something to use against people.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spin Strike allowed the user to rotate and unleash a boosted attack: Reito meant to use it against large monsters like the Blood Bears. He had never even thought of using it against human opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had used it against Mira because he thought that he couldn’t gain the upper hand while fighting normally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『In any case, this battle has let you find out a weakness: you lack battle experience against humans. You should focus on that for the time being.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It was totally different from the other times I fought against people&#8230;I never thought that I’d one day fight another person to the death&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『You managed to win this time, but if you don’t fix this weakness soon, you will be in serious trouble. Let’s focus on training your sword skills.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Sword skills&#8230;right.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Okay then, you should bring that wanted criminal to the guild. They can act on behalf of the kingdom, so you can hand her over and receive your reward. No matter how dangerous a criminal may be, if they’re surrounded by the guild’s adventurers they have no way of escape.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see. So I can entrust her to the guild and register as an adventurer too, since I’m there.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled Nao telling him that he could become a capable adventurer. His resolve to become one strengthened even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Hmm, will it be okay for a “hopeless” job holder like me to become an adventurer, though? I hope they don’t think it’s weird and I end up standing out the wrong way&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A classic development in other world novels, isn’t it? I think you could take care of such troubles with ease, but&#8230;it won’t be good if you stand out too much. Someone might figure out you are the person from the bounty four years ago too&#8230;oh right, we could do it like this: when you do the adventurer registration, you should— 』</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis further explained that there were three adventurer guilds in Adventure City. After listening to Airis’ advice, Reito and Ullr headed toward one of the adventurers’ guilds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito chose the smallest guild, with the lowest number of registered adventurers, the “Black Tiger” guild. Nao had recommended that he register with this guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This should be the place&#8230;wait, is it just me or is the building leaning to the side…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wooden building’s age clearly showed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hefted the trussed up Mira from Ullr’s back, lifted her onto his shoulder, and entered the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were dozens of people inside: some were sitting around tables and merrily chatting, others eating and drinking, talking with the receptionists, or fervently reading the paper leaflets posted on the bulletin board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, Mira still on his shoulders, proceeded inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? What’s with that brat? Coming here carrying a broad like that…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does he know that this isn’t a slave trader…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe she’s wanted? Wait, that woman&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adventurers looked at Reito with curiosity and suspicion. Some of those who recognized Mira, however, were utterly shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, acting as naturally as he could, headed toward the receptionist while repeating Airis’ advice in his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me? I caught a wanted criminal, I would like to exchange her for the reward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? A wan-wanted criminal?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bespectacled receptionist, surprised, reacted louder than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put down Mira, tied so that she couldn’t move a muscle. The receptionist hurriedly consulted the bounties, comparing them with Mira’s face over and over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what!? This is&#8230;the rank A wanted criminal Mira!? Have you captured her by yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist’s words caused all eyes in the guild to focus on Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did she say!?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-73622746' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-73622746' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He caught Mira the beheader!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito calmly answered the receptionist’s question by shaking his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then offered the excuse he had prepared in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t actually capture her, I found her knocked out in an alley. I was worried about her, but when I looked at her face, I recognized her from the wanted posters and brought her here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the plan Reito and Airis had come up with: Reito had not caught Mira by himself, but found her passed out — she had drunk too much — in an alley. He had doused her in alcohol before coming, to make the story more believable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist frowned at the smell of alcohol from Mira’s body. She probably believed Reito’s words, as she gave instructions for Mira to be brought to the underground jail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Mira woke up, Reito’s lie could be uncovered easily, but he didn’t think it would be a big problem. The most important thing was to get out of the situation without creating a fuss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many adventurers were still looking at him, but after hearing that Mira was brought in after passing out drunk in an alley, they quickly lost interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist smiled warmly at Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congratulations!! The reward is 15 gold coins!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, thank you very much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You sure got lucky, boy! That’s a damn miracle right there!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Get us a drink, c’mon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cut that out, guys&#8230;you can’t call yourself an adventurer if you mess with normal people!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito received the reward from the receptionist, attracting looks of envy from all around. He put away the money, then asked about the adventurer registration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, excuse me, I’d like to become an adventurer&#8230;can you register me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Well, yes, of course. Do you have your proof of identity?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was told this should be enough&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gave the receptionist the parchment he received from Nao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist casually scanned the contents, then suddenly went wide-eyed and stood up from her seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh, what…!? Ah, er, p-please excuse me&#8230;g-guildmaster!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the receptionist’s voice, Black Tiger’s guildmaster came to see what the fuss was about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person in charge of this adventurers’ guild was a human woman, formerly a general for the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was over 190 cm tall, had long red hair and a bulky, muscular physique scarred all over. She was apparently only in her late twenties, but her presence and aura went beyond her years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had joined the guild and reached rank S — then took over as guildmaster when the previous one suddenly passed. Her name was Bal: even after leaving the battlefield, her strength was not inferior to active adventurers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s going on? You’re awfully noisy today&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-please look at this. It’s from that princess&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh, this is…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal glanced through the parchment, then directed a sharp look at Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then asked another question to the receptionist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have the Appraisal skill, right? Is the signature real?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it is!! That’s why I called you…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So there’s no risk of this being fake&#8230;For that tomboy of a princess to write something like this is hard to believe&#8230;especially for a man.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parchment contained a statement according to which Nao vouched for Reito’s identity and was marked with her signature and the Baltros royal seal. It also reported that he was a formidable user of basic grade magic. Nao had done all she could in order for Reito to not be refused registration in the adventurers’ guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal whispered to herself, impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;that princess is a well-known man-hater, but for her to go so far&#8230;it also says here that he uses interesting magic. Can’t deny I’m curious too&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ehm, what should we do? The rules say we should hold an exam first, but&#8230;he has the princess’ introduction&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rules are the rules, even if he was introduced by the princess, he has to take the exam. Besides, I really want to see how well he can fight with basic grade magic&#8230;hey, boy!! You want to become an adventurer, right? We’ll let you take the exam!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal addressed Reito all of a sudden, so he was taken aback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, but&#8230;I haven’t paid yet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can do that later!! The training grounds are this way. Come on!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito wanted to become an adventurer while standing out as little as possible, but things definitely weren’t going as planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal led Reito to a building behind the guild: it was used by the adventurers for training. Inside, Reito found an array of weapons he had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal walked Reito to a stone-floored circle in the center of the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circle was surrounded by a wooden fence: there was only one way in and out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stood on the “ring”, facing Bal. She was ready to fight: she was equipped with armor and had a broadsword on her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to do the exam here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;what exactly are we going to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An ability test, literally. I’m not going to do anything, though: just attack as much as you want, within the time limit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal took out an hourglass, showed it to Reito, and placed it on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then smiled and continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can attack me any way you want until all the sand in this hourglass falls down. I’m only going to defend myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that really okay? You might be&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re still too green to worry about me, boy!! I won’t attack, but I’m still going to move.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He activated “Muscle Boost” to raise his physical ability, then thought about what weapon to use. His bow had been destroyed by Mira, so he decided to use “Iceclad Sword”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Iceclad Sword”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!? That’s some unusual magic&#8230;a sword of ice, huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s creation of ice longswords left Bal surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Bal reversed the hourglass and the exam officially started, Reito used Leap to instantly move closer to Bal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he was right in front of her, Reito swung his longsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaah!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant Reito performed his attack, Bal drew the broadsword on her back and parried it. The blade of her weapon shone in a platinum white hue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito created another longsword and swung them again and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with those movements? Your swords need a lot more practice!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal performed a side sweep with her broadsword, knocking Reito’s longswords away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it happened in the battle against Mira, his inexperience with the sword was revealed. Even so, Reito stepped forward to engage in close combat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whirlwind!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;— into Helmet Splitter!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito activated the Battle Art “Whirlwind” as a horizontal sweep with both of his longswords, which Bal tried to deflect with her broadsword. Reito, however, activated Helmet Splitter with one of his swords, changing its path. He tried to hit his opponent’s palm, but Bal quickly retracted her hand and dodged the attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito then held his longswords together and spun. Bal’s torso leaned backward to avoid the attack, then her leg extended to kick Reito from that position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here goes!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same development had happened during the battle against Mira.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito remembered it, so he used “Evasion” to dodge the incoming kick and let go of his two longswords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then clenched his fist and activated a Martial Artist skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bullet Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito planted his feet firmly on the floor, rotated and accelerated from his sole through the ankle, knee, hip joints, abdomen, chest, shoulder, elbow to the arm, finally directing his fist against Bal’s leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shit….“Harden”!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal activated a defensive Battle Art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The muscles on her leg became as hard as metal: when Reito’s fist collided against it, a loud, dull sound reverberated in the surroundings.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ow!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fist hurt: he felt as if he had punched a steel wall with all his might. On the other hand, Bal was in more pain, like she had been smacked down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two put more distance between each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ow ow ow&#8230;what was that skill!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ouch&#8230;that’s my line, boy! What’s with your fists!? You left a damn mark&#8230;are you really a magic-user?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s fist simply hurt a little, but Bal’s leg clearly had a mark left by his knuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had she received Reito’s attack normally, she would have surely ended up with broken bones. Cold sweat running down her back, Bal readied her broadsword again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, the exam isn’t over yet. I admit you managed to land a hit on me, but you have to keep attacking until time runs out!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? It’s not over yet!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you, you have to attack until the sand in the clock runs out. The amount of damage you will be able to inflict on me will decide your rank, so you better do it seriously. If it goes well for you, you’ll have a high rank from the start!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, intimidated by Bal’s spirit, glanced at the hourglass. There was still more than half time remaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, thinking it was a good chance to test his abilities, decided to use more of his powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can use magic too, right? Then&#8230;Flame Bullet!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whaat!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito pointed his palm upwards and created a giant Fireball, which left Bal flabbergasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito hadn’t poured his full power into the Fireball: he thought that he would end up burning his opponent into a crisp if he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stopped increasing the Fireball’s size when it was about one meter wide, then shot it at Bal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eat this!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch, who do you take me for!? Helmet Splitter!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal faced the descending Fireball head-on and cleaved it in half with her broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her body dripping with sweat, she breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay, that was really surprising&#8230;pretty good, boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re saying that after you just cut through my magic…? Was that a sword skill too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito too was surprised by Bal’s feat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course not, my sword is just made of Mithril. Weapons made of magic metals can work on magic. You didn’t know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think I’ve heard that before&#8230;okay then, how about this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito decided to go for quantity instead of quality for his next attack: he materialized 20 Fireballs all around himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;Scattershot!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You just made that up, did you!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fireballs floating around Reito all shot towards Bal at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guildmaster, her broadsword ready, calmly analyzed the Fireballs’ path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly realized that Fireballs traveled only in a straight line and swung her broadsword without even attempting to dodge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal activated another defensive skill: she drew a circle with her broadsword and wiped out the Fireballs one by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, Fireballs exploded upon impact, but when they touched her broadsword they vanished as if put out by a strong wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was surprised, then understood that the skill she used was similar to his Battle Art “Circle Parry”. He then switched to the next attack, in order not to give her any time to rest.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-96866139' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-96866139' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay then, how about this! Flame Lance!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lance of fire? Interesting!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal looked at the flaming lance flying towards her and smiled. She deactivated “Parry” and met the lance with her sword, erasing it instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing solely on the Flame Lance, even for an instant, was enough for Bal to lose sight of Reito. As soon as she realized he wasn’t in front of her, she quickly scanned the surroundings, eventually perceiving there was something unusual above her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked up and found Reito, swinging his Iceclad Sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helmet Splitter!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal immediately pulled up her broadsword. As soon as she blocked the attack, Reito let go of his weapon and activated a magic spell at point-blank range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind Blade!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gwah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crescent blade of wind struck Bal’s body: the impact was cushioned by her armor, but still managed to send her flying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch..shit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal was back on her feet the next instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized that not even Wind Blade, which could fell an Orc in one blow, was enough to cause significant damage, then sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;I’ve used too much magic power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah&#8230;you look more strained than me. What are you going to do? There’s still time left.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito glanced at the hourglass: judging from the remaining sand, there was less than one minute left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal had moved to the edge of the arena. Reito used Leap and went to the opposite side of the ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He prepared his broadsword and held it horizontally in front, then Bal called out to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re still up for more? Sure, I’ll take it, I haven’t had a fight like this in a while&#8230;give me all you’ve got!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, then&#8230;could you move three steps to the left?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh? Yeah, why not&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito waited for Bal to comply with his curiously detailed request, then activated Observing Eye. He carefully confirmed their positions, then gripped his broadsword tighter and focused to unleash the next — and final attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He eventually spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin Strike!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whaat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the distance between them, Reito swept his broadsword horizontally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal was dumbfounded at the apparently meaningless attack, but soon enough realized something was different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started his second rotation, without losing momentum. Slowly but surely, he was coming closer to Bal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woooohhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kh&#8230;Strike Blade!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal judged she could not fully parry the attack and went on the offensive instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The muscles on her arms swelled, as she focused all of her power in a single blow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two broadswords clashed, producing a deafening metallic sound and shaking the fences surrounding the ring.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was sprawled on the floor of the ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal looked at him, holding her left arm. Her Mithril broadsword was lying at her feet — visible cracks on its blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal glanced at the Ice Block shards scattered in the surroundings, then spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;The difference in our weapons was the reason why I won. Honestly, I didn’t expect you could go that far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hah&#8230;hah&#8230;hah&#8230;what about&#8230;the exam…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You pass. Only a fool would fail you after all this. Anyhow, sorry for knocking you down like that, despite promising I wouldn’t attack. As a token of apology, you’re exempt from the exam fees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal then sat on the ground, smiling as she rubbed her arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was relieved to hear he safely passed — though the plan he and Airis had come up with involved joining the guild without standing out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, acting while standing out as little as possible was always going to be a priority. Otherwise, his connection with the kingdom might be discovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito recalled something Airis told him.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-87757956' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-87757956' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Listen well, Reito: if you wish to lead a normal life, you have to stay in rank D or C. Adventurers of rank B, A, and S easily become subject of rumors, so you should make sure you never reach them. A normal life is possible only up to rank C, remember.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had gone fairly overboard, so Reito started worrying — though it was too late. Bal pulled him up on his feet, then told him something very unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From today, you’re a rank F adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Rank&#8230;F?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Disappointed? To be honest, since you pushed me this much, you might as well go straight to rank B&#8230;but the way you use your sword is too unstable. You’ve only fought monsters until now, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing the same thing Mira had told him, Reito was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eergh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew it. If you think adventurers are always fighting against monsters, you’re dead wrong. Catching thieves, guarding merchant convoys, escorting nobles, assisting security guards, patrolling towns&#8230;we take all sorts of requests. Even if you’re strong, if you aren’t used to fighting people I can’t let you go to a high rank just like that, you understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was nothing Reito could say: Bal was right on all accounts. She smiled, then glanced at her broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I’ve been using this sword ever since I became an adventurer, but it’s actually a failed piece, at least according to the master of the smithy I always go to. It’s too focused on sturdiness and weight, at the expense of its sharpness. It’s also too heavy for normal people to use well&#8230;so I’m the only one who can.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, is it really so heavy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Want to try holding it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, his interest piqued, reached for Bal’s broadsword. He took it in his hands, but it was too heavy: he had to let go almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadsword fell to the ground with a clanging sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“S-so heavy&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right? Other than me, I reckon only Giants can use it. Still, despite all of its sturdiness, it’s all cracked like this now&#8230;that last attack was something else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-thank you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thanked Bal, but could not feel genuinely happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recalling how easily she handled the broadsword, he realized once again how terrifyingly strong she was. She only defended herself in the exam, but in a normal fight, she would have bested him easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal looked back at Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His final blow had been powerful enough to crack her broadsword: so strong she had to use one of her ultimate techniques, “Strike Blade”, which she had sealed when she stopped being an adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— I found a worthy successor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a thought flashed in her mind. He was still immature as a swordsman, but with some polishing, he could turn into a hero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your name&#8230;was Reito, wasn’t it? Who taught you the sword?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An assassin who worked as a maid for my family&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!? An assassin&#8230;and maid? Which is it…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er, well, I kind of learned it on my own, anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito learned the basics of swordsmanship from Aria: he came up with his twin sword style and use of the broadsword himself however, so it was not wrong to say that he learned them by myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal nodded, convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His movements with the sword were very unusual. She immediately understood that he had no experience in fighting against humans, but his attacks definitely worked against monsters.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-96598118' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-96598118' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had no intention of handing down her “Strike Blade” to anyone, but that very moment, she decided to teach it to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal looked at Reito, straight in his eyes, and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you remember the last attack I used on you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;I’m sorry, I was so focused on attacking that I didn’t&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, you were spinning around like that after all&#8230;that was my ‘Strike Blade’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had never heard that before, so he cocked his head to the side, puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it a Battle Art?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. But I’m probably the only Human that knows it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Why is that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very few Humans use broadswords in the first place. They’re really heavy and hard to use, while there are plenty of other swords that are just as good, or better, choices&#8230;for me, well, I’ve never used any other weapon on the battlefield.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few Humans wielded the heavy broadsword as their weapon of choice. If they didn’t have superhuman strength like Bal, they would have difficulty wielding such swords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadsword that Reito created with Iceclad Sword was much lighter than a real one, and he could change its weight at will too. A real broadsword was too heavy for him to wield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This “Strike Blade” skill is generally used by Giant broadsword fighters. They tend to rely on their brute strength to fight, though: you can’t call that a sword skill, if you ask me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your way is different?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t just swing the sword with power&#8230;I give it my all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, unable to grasp the meaning of Bal’s words, stood there gawking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guildmaster then picked up her broadsword and took a stance. She swung it down, tearing through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, looking at her movements, felt that something was off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reflected on it, as Bal lifted the sword on her shoulders and turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So? Could you tell the difference from how I swung it during the battle?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;maybe, did you just use your arms this time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right.  Most Giants fight like this too: they tend to rely only on the strength in their arms to fight. If Humans like us did the same, our arms wouldn’t hold up, so we have to use our whole body’s muscles when wielding the sword.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal then performed another large sword swing: this time she used not only her arms but her whole body as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blade cleaved the air at a much higher speed, even producing a shockwave on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito realized that he had been wielding his swords in the same way, using his whole body. He felt as if a question he didn’t even know he had was answered. Bal then spoke again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you wield a heavy weapon, your lower body is more important than your arms: your legs and hips need to be able to support the great weight of the weapon. I see you’ve been training them well though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well&#8230;I didn’t do it on purpose, it just happened.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito often used skills such as Leap and Swift Legs when he lived in the Abyssal Forest, running alongside Ullr to hunt down monsters. Thanks to that, his lower body was well developed and trained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal smiled at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That Spin Strike of yours was pretty good, but you can’t keep moving like that in battle, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right, well&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And so I thought of teaching you something right up your alley. I don’t know if you’ll be able to use it like me, but it won’t hurt to learn it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Do you mean, Strike Blade?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. Well, at least the basics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal thus started teaching Reito how to do Strike Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was far more unique than the other skills he had learned until then, however: it looked like it would take him a long time to learn it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, he could not learn it that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterward, Reito returned to the adventurers’ guild. He registered as an F rank adventurer and received his guild card and a copper badge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventurers wore badges that changed depending on their rank: copper for ranks F and E, silver for D and C, gold for B and A, and Mithril for S.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-90284704' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-90284704' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bal had accompanied Reito back inside the guild building, so Reito asked her how to undertake requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you find work in the guild?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“See that bulletin board? Just check what requests are posted there and tell the receptionist. Well, you’re still a greenhorn, so start from the chores.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh, chores?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Adventurers do pretty much anything, there’s a lot more than hunting monsters. If you want to find good requests, you have to get the townspeople to trust you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, Bal walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the bulletin board, examining the pieces of parchment posted on it one by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most requests could only be undertaken by adventurers at least rank E or D: there was only one suitable for rank F.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is&#8230;a Goblin extermination request, huh. I should be able to handle it just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The party sending the request was not a Lunot citizen, but someone from a nearby village. The request was simple: to take down the Goblins raiding the village’s crops. Depending on the numbers, the reward would increase too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito removed the parchment from the board and brought it to the reception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me, I’d like to take this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, yes, right away. Congratulations on passing the exam. Please show me your guild card, then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito gave his card to the receptionist, who then checked the request parchment and took care of the necessary procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here you go, no problem here. Please do your best and take care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The receptionist returned the guild card and parchment to Reito then sent him words of encouragement. He bowed his head and left, heading toward the location marked in the request.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span>◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Reito arrived at the village, he realized he had already failed his first request. Or rather — more precisely — that he couldn’t receive the reward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village marked in the request was indeed the one he visited after leaving the Abyssal Forest, where he met princess Nao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So the request came from this village&#8230;it’s too late to do anything, then&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The village had sent the extermination request to the guild before the village was destroyed, but its population had been wiped out. Even if there were survivors, there was no way to receive a reward after what happened to the village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh well, the request is over&#8230;by the way, Ullr, how do you like the crown?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arrf!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crown was an accessory that Reito put on Ullr before they left the town.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had bought it with the bounty money so that Ullr wouldn’t be mistaken as a monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought of getting a collar first, but Ullr hated the idea, so he ended up buying an expensive crown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That cost good money, you know. Well, it looks good on you, so it’s fine, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sighed, about to start retracing his steps back to the Adventure City, when Ullr suddenly barked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!! Arf!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? What’s up buddy, did you find something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr headed off on his own. Reito followed him for a while until shouting voices reached his ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-WAAAHHH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orraaaaaahhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are you doing, you idiot!! Run!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several human voices and a monster’s roar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr ran towards the source of the commotion: they found a group of men and women, as well as a Beastman captured by a massive green giant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thought the roar belonged to a Goblin, but changed his mind when he saw the monster’s size. It was as large as a Blood Bear cub, with a face much more hideous and menacing than a Goblin. The color of its skin was also darker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito contacted Airis, in order to learn more about the monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Airis!!』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s a Troll. They look a bit like Goblins but are completely different monsters. Their arms are about as powerful as Blood Bears arms, and they also have enough intelligence to use weapons. They are extremely resilient, so do be careful.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A Troll&#8230;so we have to fight it in a women’s toilet!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes, I’ve seen that movie too&#8230;but that’s not the case, is it!?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll was holding the swordsman-like Beastman by the neck, clearly trying to choke him. Reito immediately pointed his palm at the monster’s back and activated a magic spell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ice Blade Bullet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orryah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ice Block blades stabbed the Troll’s back. The monster’s body was sturdier than Reito expected, so they failed to pierce through it, but the Troll lost its hold on the Beastman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster turned around, facing Reito and Ullr.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-33436154' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-33436154' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No questions, just run!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito yelled back at the swordsman’s question, then activated Iceclad Sword to form longswords in both of his hands. He then jumped on Ullr’s back and charged the Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ORRAAAHHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll roared, but Ullr and Reito did not falter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster crossed its arms to defend itself; Reito activated the Alchemist skill Shape Change to make his sword’s blade vibrate at high speed, then struck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whirlwind!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orrgah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood splattered on the ground, causing a reaction from the adventurers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No way!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-he cut&#8230;a Troll!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vibrating blades dug deep in the Troll’s arms. The arms weren’t fully severed, but the cuts caused very deep wounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito removed the blades, then ordered Ullr to move away from the monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They lack power compared to the broadsword, after all&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beast Swordsman lifted up one of his comrades — an unconscious Axeman, collapsed on the ground — then spoke to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey you!! Take care of the Troll! We’re running away first!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huuh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised to be put in charge of fighting a strong opponent so casually, Reito blurted out a lame sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman of the group, probably a Martial Artist, ran to a female Magician who was collapsed on the ground and bleeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Amyr!! Pull yourself together!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lin, give up!! We can’t save her&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Beastman’s words were cold. The Martial Artist called Lin, however, shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No!! I-I can’t give up like this…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ORRAAAHHH….!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll suddenly roared angrily and switched its target to the adventurers attempting to flee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching the Troll approach at incredible speed, the Beastman yelped and dropped the comrade he was carrying on his shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah!? D-don’t get any closer!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“D-Dacen!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orruaaahhhh!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Dacen was the Beastman. His legs gave out and he fell down: the Troll raised its right leg, ready to squash him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito directed Ullr to run toward the monster’s back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crap&#8230;I have to make it…!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, using what little remained of his magic power, activated Magic Power Boost on the two Iceclad Swords in his hands, which started emitting chilling air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trolls had extremely sturdy bodies: Reito had already confirmed this fact, however, he knew that his vibrating blades could cut them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, still riding on Ullr, stabbed the monster’s back with his swords.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ORRYAAAHHH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ooh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito knew that even if he managed to cut through the Troll’s skin, he could not go much deeper: he thus poured a massive amount of chilling air in the Iceclad Swords planted in the monster’s body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll froze from the inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rraa&#8230;graaah…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;did we do it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the Troll &#8211; now frozen stiff &#8211; and sighed in relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That very same moment, a jolt of pain coursed through his hands. He looked at them and saw they were freezing too: he hurriedly let go of the swords and cast Fireball to melt the ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ow, ow, ow&#8230;I knew it, if I use Magic Power Boost on Ice Block, it gets too cold to touch&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know, I know&#8230;Recovery Boost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito reinforced his healing abilities to mend his wounds faster, then approached the frozen Troll. It was completely encased in ice, so it was not possible to recover any materials or items.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito raised his palm to finish off the monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flame Bullet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flaming bullets shot towards the monster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matter mixed with water becomes brittle when frozen, and the Troll’s body was no exception: it shattered to pieces fairly easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;we managed somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen, the Beast Swordsman, and Lin the Martial Artist approached Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A-are you&#8230;an adventurer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8230;you saved us!! Thank you so much!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, it’s nothing&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had acted on the spur of the moment, but his actions indeed saved the small group from an untimely demise. Reito simply focused on the monster, however, so it felt strange to be thanked all of a sudden like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen, who tried to run off leaving Reito behind, had an awkward expression, but Lin’s thanks were sincere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know how to thank you&#8230;we would have been killed if it wasn’t for you. Hey, Dacen, you say something too!! He just saved our lives!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I’m sorry, thank you for saving us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s nothing&#8230;er, are the other two okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-oh, right!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen and Lin ran towards the unconscious Axeman and Magician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were heavily wounded, but they were not in mortal danger. Lin took out a glass bottle with green liquid inside, then spoke to the Magician called Amyr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t move&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uuh&#8230;aaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito inquired about the green liquid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A recovery potion. It’s a low-grade one, but it’s enough to heal wounds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Lin poured the potion on Amyr’s wound, it closed immediately, as if the blood was just washed away. The Magician looked more peaceful as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the Axeman, Garril, was in a worse state. He had probably been blown away by the Troll’s fists: his left arm was bent in an unnatural direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it&#8230;hold on, Garril, I’ll definitely help you…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen grabbed his comrade’s arm, trying his hardest to help him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen tried to make Garill drink a recovery potion, but Garril was drifting in and out of consciousness, so he wasn’t able to focus on drinking it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn it, Garill!! You have to drink this!! Wake up!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, unable to stand there watching anymore, offered to heal Garill’s wounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;can I try casting healing magic on him?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? R-really!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“P-please!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito pressed his palm on Garill’s body, then cast Recovery Boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just a support spell, but he had maxed out its proficiency, so it was enough to heal Garill’s wounds, little by little. Even his bent left arm returned to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garril eventually regained consciousness and spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uuh&#8230;ah&#8230;what..happened to me…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh thank goodness!! Garill, you’re awake!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m saved&#8230;thank you so much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin embraced Garill, who expressed his gratitude to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t mention it. But are you really okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito asked, worried, and Dacen replied with a stern look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s lost a lot of blood&#8230;we have to go back to the Adventure City immediately so he can rest. Why in the world was a Troll here, of all places&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fiery Flames&#8230;are no more, then&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito asked what that meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Fiery Flames?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people over there. We were taking a break there with them, then out of the blue the Troll attacked.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin pointed at the village elder’s house — from which Reito had stolen his clothes during his previous visit to the village. It was supposed to be the largest building in the village, but it was now half-demolished, probably because of the Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were splatters of blood everywhere: you could smell the blood from a distance. The carnage inside was not difficult to imagine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen spoke to Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to take these two back to Lunot, what will you do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, er, I still have some business here, so&#8230;”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-65809229' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-65809229' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see&#8230;okay then. Be careful though, this is a dangerous place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dacen and Lin lifted the half-unconscious Garill and Amyr on their shoulders and headed towards the carriage they stopped nearby, not before speaking with Reito one last time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re ‘Red Flag’, a party of adventurers in the Adventurers’ Guild Fang Dragon. If anything happens, we’ll be happy to help you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for everything! If you ever need anything, just say the word!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take care on your way back&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito watched them go, then turned towards the Troll’s corpse. His surprise attack was successful, but he didn’t expect to defeat it without a scratch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would have been much worse if we fought it normally&#8230;it was tougher than a Blood Bear, after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What should we do with the body though? Doesn’t look like we can get anything useful out of it&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito examined the Troll’s remains with Observing Eye: its claws and fangs were all damaged, its teeth all decayed and rotten: there was nothing valuable to be found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Orcs, Troll meat was not fit for consumption: Ullr stayed away from it after a quick sniff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a shame, but there’s nothing to collect&#8230;I should probably take the head though. I don’t know if we get money out of it, but it’s still proof we defeated it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Arf!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito picked up the Troll’s head and activated his Storage magic. Living beings could not be stored in the Storage subspace, but dead bodies were treated as items, so Reito could store them without trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then looked at the elder’s residence. He thought to see what became of the “Fiery Flames” party of adventurers, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This&#8230;is just horrible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito found four corpses inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One had their neck snapped, another one their head smashed, the third one their body ripped apart — the final one tried escaping through a window, but was stomped, their back broken, left hanging from the windowsill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Aiiiriiissss….』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Let me go ahead and say it, I don’t like scary movies&#8230;anyway, what’s wrong?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What should I do with these people?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『The adventurers’ corpses..』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Reito registered with the guild, he was told what to do in such a situation. He asked Airis anyway, to confirm what he was supposed to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『When an adventurer dies, a living adventurer in their same party receives the rights to their possessions. The members would then report to the guild. If a lone adventurer dies, whoever finds them is supposed to report to the guild, which will take their possessions, but the person who found the deceased adventurer will receive a reward.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Since they’re all dead, I should collect all of their possessions?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s right. By the way, I said that the guild will take the dead adventurers’ possessions if there are no living party members, but most humans take whatever they can before they report to the guild.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Eh? Is that allowed?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『It’s difficult to say&#8230;but the guild generally turns a blind eye to such cases. Even if there are traces that the bodies were stripped of their possessions, you can simply say it was the doing of monsters. Goblins, for example, are often curious about human tools.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How horrible&#8230;but I guess it’s normal here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I suppose so. The guild tacitly approves of it anyway, so why don’t you check if you can find anything useful? You’ve used the tools left behind by the people who lived in the cave, didn’t you? If the owners are dead, there’s no harm in taking their things for yourself.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airis’ explanation was convincing, but Reito wondered if it was really the right thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started by examining the adventurers’ remains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on their equipment and appearance, Reito surmised that the party was composed of a Swordsman, a Martial Artist, a Magician, and an Axeman, just like “Red Flag”. As they wore equipment matching their jobs, Reito noticed that some of their gear seemed rather valuable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The defensive gear is all unusable&#8230;I guess it couldn’t withstand the Troll’s attacks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were fragments of shields and armor scattered all over: Reito realized once again what a fearsome opponent the Troll was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could take the weapons, then&#8230;please forgive me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito clasped his hands and apologized to the dead adventurers, then picked up a staff and a sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staff, probably used by the Magician, was snapped in half, but the fire elemental magic stone on the tip was still in one piece. Magic stones, items capable of boosting magic, were very important items traded at high prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito put the staff into his Storage subspace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, is this sword made of magic metal?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sword was broken: the blade and hilt were separated. The blade was shining like a gemstone, so Reito asked Airis about it, and learned it was made of Mithril, the same material as Bal’s broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That sword was made by a Dwarf, apparently. The blade is consumed by years of usage, so it is of no more use. It was a treasured sword handed down in their household, so they fought by relying excessively on the weapon, that is why it reached its limit. The hilt can still be used though. It’s made with materials from the World Tree too.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『World Tree? What’s that?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『A gigantic tree that has existed since the birth of this world. It grows in the Elven capital city. Materials taken from its branches are used in various weapons.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Ooh, I see&#8230;what effects does it have?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Strong resistance to magic, far higher than average magic metals. It’s a very valuable item.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Really&#8230;』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito looked at the hilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Alchemist abilities could do nothing with the blade, but the hilt could be repurposed. He picked it up and stored it, together with the blade, just in case, when—&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr’s warning bark was heard from outside the residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito rushed out of the residence and found himself face to face with a green giant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He immediately armed himself with an Iceclad Sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orraaaaaahhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crap, another one!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrrrr….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito and Ullr were once again facing a Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about one head taller than the previous one. The monster walked towards them, stepping over the remains of its dead brethren.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito called Ullr closer, then readied his ice broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll wielded a broadsword too, so it seemed dangerous to approach it as they did in the previous battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr, do you think you could handle it by yourself?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr shook his head to Reito’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a monster himself, he could clearly tell the gap in strength between them. Ullr knew he couldn’t fight the Troll by itself, so he went to Reito&#8217;s side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the many other species of giant monsters, Trolls were not extremely large in size. Their intimidating aura, however, made them appear bigger than they actually were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito carefully walked one step forward.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If things get dangerous I’m counting on you, Ullr.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orroh…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, the Troll started beating its chest like a gorilla and roared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito felt the urge to retreat, but there was nothing but a lake behind him. He literally had no escape: Reito thus decided to advance instead and activated Leap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here goes&#8230;wah?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hgrrrh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Reito could go on the offensive, the Troll swung down its broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito rolled on the ground to dodge: the blade crashed down with a rumble. The earth shook as if rocked by an explosion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be on the receiving end of such a blow would definitely be fatal. Reito gave an order to Ullr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ullr!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr jumped on the Troll’s head and sank his sharp fangs on its neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood spurted from the monster’s neck. Only one layer of its sturdy skin had been pierced however. The wound was far from deadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the Troll, irritated, focused on Ullr however — an opening was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stood up, then swung his ice broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Take this!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orrah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two broadswords clashed, with the shrill sound of clanging metal. The Troll’s sword was made of copper, so it cracked immediately after meeting Reito’s Iceclad Sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crap&#8230;Circle Parry!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll shot its other unarmed fist at Reito, who spun his sword to block it — as Bal had done against him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll’s fist was forced in a different direction: the monster thus lost its balance, so Reito took advantage of the situation to unleash a kick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eat this!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rraah…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito planted his foot in the beast’s stomach, but the latter seemed unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the contrary, Reito felt pain: as if he tried to kick a metal plate with all of his might.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that normal blunt blows couldn’t damage the Troll, Reito activated a spell at point-blank range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flame Bullet!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flaming fireball struck the Troll’s body and sent the monster flying several meters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, holding his broadsword tight, observed the Troll from a distance. Flame Bullet was the most powerful fire element spell he knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll stood up again, swatted the flames away from its body, and howled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrr….RUOAAAHHHH!!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damned monster&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trolls were supposed to be weak to fire, like Orcs, but Flame Bullet could only cause a slight wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, cold sweat streaming down his back, glanced at his ice sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking it would be difficult to damage the Troll using his normal strength, he activated Muscle Boost to reinforce his physical abilities to the maximum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then used Shape Change to make the blade vibrate at high speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here I go!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RRRAAHHHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito started running, broadsword in hand: at the same time, the Troll moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vibration raised the broadsword’s sharpness to its limits. Reito swung, targeting the monster’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“HAAAAAAAAAHH!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graaah…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment Reito swung his sword, the Troll stopped in its tracks: it had probably perceived the incoming danger and put up its right arm to defend itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s Iceclad Sword clashed against the monster’s arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll’s steel-like skin had repelled it before, but this time the broadsword carved into the monster’s flesh, instantly cutting through it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRAAAHHH!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not done yet!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll screamed in pain, but Reito did not waste time: he quickly removed the sword and thrust it towards the monster’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll rolled backward, however, causing the attack to go through thin air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn you&#8230;Helmet Splitter!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAHH!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito swung down his broadsword on the Troll, but the monster rolled again and dodged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch&#8230;you’re not getting away!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrruaaah…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While giving chase to the fleeing Troll, Reito decided to try using the sword technique Bal taught him, Strike Blade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grrrrowl!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graah!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr bit down on the Troll’s legs, stopping its movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito did not miss the opportunity: he lifted the broadsword above his head, as he recalled Bal’s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Am I clear? To use Strike Blade, you have to focus your whole body’s muscles on the swing. Giants can do it with just their arms, but Humans don’t have enough strength to pull the same thing off. You have to put your legs and waist in the swing too. Don’t think too hard about it, just swing the sword with all of your might.』</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">『During our battle, you used Bullet Strike, a Martial Artist skill, right? It was my first time seeing it, but&#8230;you rotate your whole body to use it, didn’t you. That means that you already know how to use your whole body’s muscles in an attack. You’ll learn Strike Blade soon enough, I’m sure.』</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Never rely on Strike Blade too much, though. It can cause heavy damage to your opponent, but if you miss you’ll be full of openings.』</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito stepped forward with eager momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like he did when activating Spin Strike, he subconsciously twisted his whole body as he swung down the broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“WOAAAAHHHH!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GRRROAAAHHH!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strength from all of his muscles poured in the swing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll tried defending itself with its remaining arm, but the broadsword struck too fast for the monster to react in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;Battle Art “Strike Blade” acquired.&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Graah&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll’s arm soared in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skill acquisition screen appeared before Reito’s eyes. At the same time, his broadsword’s blade was painted red. He only managed to cut the Troll’s arm however: it didn’t reach the monster’s chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, having used too much strength already, was about to faint, but he planted his broadsword in the ground to prop himself up. At that moment, Ullr barked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito regained full control of his senses and looked at the armless Troll. He took the broadsword in his hands again and activated Heavy Strike, a skill that manipulated gravity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crimson magic power surged in his palm: he extracted the sword from the ground, raising a cloud of dust that blinded the Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heavy Strike!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grouh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito didn’t let the opportunity go to waste, and raised the broadsword with Heavy Strike still active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then used the Battle Art he was the most proficient with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spin&#8230;Strike!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“GROAAAHHHH!!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The broadsword, imbued with gravity, spun and slashed the Troll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monster’s body, as tough as steel, was torn in half. At the same time, Reito’s broadsword cracked and shattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Waah…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr ran to the collapsing Reito and supported his body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Troll fell, its body split in two. The boy realized that he had finally won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did it…! But it was too hard&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine…*lick*”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahaha, thanks&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr licked Reito’s cheeks. The latter responded by patting his partner’s head, then looked at the Troll’s broadsword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hilt had broken off during the battle, so only the blade remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An idea flashed in Reito’s mind. Could it be possible to combine the World Tree hilt he collected with this broadsword’s blade?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito, despite feeling tired, decided to test it immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm&#8230;unlike magic metal, you can use skills on this&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magic metals were normally unaffected by Alchemist skills. The World Tree material, while it had properties similar to magic metals, was still wood: Reito could use his skills on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retro took the Troll’s broadsword and combined it with the World Tree hilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>&lt;Exclusive Skill “Grafting” acquired.&gt;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status window appeared before Reito, signaling the acquisition of a new skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito picked up the broadsword from its new hilt and tried swinging it. He made sure the hilt was firmly attached, then collected the dead adventurers’ badges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once he was done, Reito sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I never expected my first request to turn out like this&#8230;I’m beat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whiine&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back for today. I got a new weapon anyway, so it’s all good in the end, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito thus decided to go back to the Black Tiger guild.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s request officially ended as a failure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parties that sent the request were dead, so it was not a valid request from the start. The failure was not Reito’s responsibility, so the request was removed from the guild records too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito had not worked hard for nothing, though: the party he saved, Red Flag, visited the Black Tiger guild to bring him a reward for healing their members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to their visit, Reito also learned of the circumstances behind the incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two Trolls that appeared in the village were targets of extermination requests undertaken by “Fiery Flames” and “Red Flag”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trolls were not wild monsters, but “pets” of a certain noble. He picked up and kept the Trolls when he was a child, but lost interest or became too busy to keep them after he became an adult, so the Trolls were returned to the wild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being raised by people, the Trolls adapted to nature quickly and started attacking village after village, causing severe damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fang Dragon guild parties “Fiery Flames” and “Red Flag” were tasked with locating the two Trolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parties arrived at the village while looking for the Trolls and entered the residence to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the Trolls’ attacked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, “Fiery Flames” were annihilated and “Red Flag” could survive only thanks to Reito’s timely arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Red Flag” members gave Reito half of the reward they received for their request, five gold coins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito’s own request ended up a failure, but helping the Red Flag party unexpectedly earned him a small fortune.</span></p>
