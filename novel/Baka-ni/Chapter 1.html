<p class="calibre4">“Was the neighbor last night really Tenjō-sensei?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The following morning, I sat at my desk and pondered the events of last night after arriving at school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Could it have been an illusion borne from the loneliness that a man who lives alone unconsciously carries?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s hard to believe that my own homeroom teacher lives next door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I, Yuunagi Nishiki, attend a college preparatory school in Tokyo, the private Kiyō High School.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Class 2-C, attendance number 23, and I’m not a member of any clubs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I take my studies seriously, as per the agreement with my father who pays my living expenses, so my grades aren’t bad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have friends to talk to during breaks, but no one is close enough to call my best friend. No girlfriend either.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And my class’s homeroom teacher is none other than Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, but we did touch hands.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The sensation and warmth of our overlapping hands were real.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The strawberries she brought over are still in my room’s refrigerator.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eating them for breakfast, they are as sweet, juicy, and delicious as she described.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Near the entrance of my room, I kept the sandal she left behind in case of her return.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s like a fairy tale of Cinderella for her to leave her glass slipper behind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she were called a princess, I would immediately agree.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō is indeed that strikingly beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nevertheless, the Onee-san next door ran off at full speed as soon as I introduced myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If a man living next door who has had no interaction with her knows her name then yeah… even if not Sensei, maybe any woman would get scared and run away…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a night’s reflection, I looked back on my behavior with a wry smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our doors and mailboxes only display our room numbers. Neither I nor Sensei have nameplates that reveal our names.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her reaction was perfectly natural for a young woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, the probability of a student and a teacher coincidentally becoming neighbors is far more unlikely.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei living next door, can such a thing really happen?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Despite my surprise, I found myself slightly excited.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just knowing that a beautiful woman lives beyond the wall under the same roof makes my heart race.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, everyone! The weather is clear and pleasant this morning!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When homeroom time arrived in the morning, Reiyu Tenjō appeared in the classroom with her usual cheerful attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She stood at the podium with her usual bright smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">My seat is at the very front of the central row of the classroom, directly in front of the teacher’s desk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Meaning, I’m sitting right in front of Sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Our eyes meet for a moment, but Tenjō-sensei maintains her refreshing smile without faltering.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the pressure she must feel having a student she met privately the night before sitting right in front of her, she handles it impressively.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After the class representative’s call to order, she takes attendance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei joined Kiyō High School last year as a new teacher, the same year I enrolled in this school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She immediately drew attention throughout the school as the incredibly beautiful new teacher.</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I first saw her, I instantly knew that she was the rumored Tenjō-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without a doubt, she was the most beautiful woman I had ever met in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her face, her figure, her manner, her intelligence&mdash;&mdash;everything about her was top-notch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if you live a decent life, such an amazing woman seemed like someone you’d never encounter in a lifetime.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The expression ‘stunningly beautiful’ was made a reality for me by Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, my interest in her was not solely because of her looks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I still remember the moment I was first captivated by her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">One day, not long after I enrolled in the school, I happened to be on the day duty and was tasked by the math teacher to collect homework prints and take them to the staff room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I took the prints to the staff room, the math teacher was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instead, my attention was captured by a teacher who was working intently at a desk by herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That was Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even in the midst of the staff room, I was spellbound by her profile and couldn’t move.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was struck by how cool a woman not much different in age from myself appeared as she worked seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I envied her ability to be so engrossed in her work so much that I hesitated to interrupt her to ask about the math teacher.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her seriousness was admirable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Being someone who struggles to work hard myself, I found myself admiring her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And yet, it was a mystery that someone with such beauty had chosen to be a teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My curiosity was piqued by so many thoughts, one after the other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In essence, I found Reiyu Tenjō’s dedication endearing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Oh? Do you need something?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She noticed my gaze and looked up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she spoke to me, I remember my response was vague.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I probably explained my errand while stumbling over my words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei laughed and pointed out, ‘Sensei’s desk is over there’ to help me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was a simple, business-like conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But for me, it was the first time we had spoken one-on-one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since then, I have become increasingly intrigued by Reiyu Tenjō Sensei, as if she were an object of my admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I learned that such a young and beautiful woman was to be the homeroom teacher of class 2-C this year, the whole class was excited.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Of course, I was among them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A breathtaking beauty when she’s silent, a friendly Onee-san when she speaks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I had to be looked after by a homeroom teacher for a year, I’d definitely prefer Tenjō-sensei over someone intimidating.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And due to the seat changes at the beginning of the term, I ended up sitting right in front of Sensei like this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I respond with a simple ‘Yes’ as naturally as I can.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei didn’t show any signs of disturbance either and simply continued calling the next student’s name.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As usual. No particular changes are noticeable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was I the only one feeling self-conscious? At this point, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I came up with a few strategies to clarify whether I was mistaken about last night’s incident or not.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Strategy number one: observe Tenjō-sensei closely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her light-colored long hair shines translucent in the sunlight streaming in through the window.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her fair skin glows as if illuminated from within.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her large eyes sparkle like gemstones, and her glossy lips and the high bridge of her nose within her petite face all seem to be placed in the best balance by the goddess of beauty herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her outfit consists of a white blouse with a light blue cardigan draped over it, paired with a tight long skirt.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The business-casual attire composed of simple items gives off an intellectual attractiveness and a refreshing impression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She also advises the swimming club, and her posture, back straight, makes her stand out even more.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite being a teacher, Reiyu Tenjō is too gorgeous.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, let’s all do our best today!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After delivering the final announcements, Tenjō-sensei left the classroom as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oops, I was so mesmerized that the morning homeroom ended before I knew it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…was last night just my misperception?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Maybe the neighbor isn’t Sensei but another person with a similar face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because the interaction was so brief, my certainty that it was Reiyu Tenjō herself started to waver.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, my heart was denying the theory of it being someone else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was pondering this, the late-arriving student Akira Kuhouin walked past in front of my desk.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The former track and field ace who arrived late has a strong-willed face with sleepy eyes, and a Chupa Chups is sticking out of her mouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rather than looking dignifed, she comes across as brazen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s a girl with a somewhat unusual delinquent-like vibe for this school, and secretly, many boys are interested in her</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, Kuhouin. Late for the homeroom again, I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t suddenly talk to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She glanced at me sharply and quickly headed to her seat by the window.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">Strategy number two: probe indirectly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The fourth period was a Japanese history class, and once again, Tenjō-sensei visited the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei’s Japanese history class is very popular among the students.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s known for explaining historical events clearly and making many figures memorable, so names are easy to remember.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She also mixes in soft topics like popular historical content and news, which makes history very easy to understand, even for those who are not interested.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Nishiki-kun, your pen has stopped moving. Are you following the board?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice snapped me out of it, and I realized my notebook was completely blank.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had been too focused on finding the right moment to ask her a question by taking advantage of the position of my seat and had neglected to write.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t erase it! I’ll write it down now!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">From this front-row seat, my view is almost entirely filled by Sensei at the podium and the blackboard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition to the seating position, it is especially easy to stop when Reiyu Tenjō is in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s because I could watch her forever without getting tired.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s hard to see from the front row, isn’t it? I’ll wait a bit for you. If anyone else isn’t done, hurry up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei allows for a little break time as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Reiyu-chan Sensei is just too beautiful, I think it’s hard to concentrate, especially for the boys~.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ririka Mayuzumi, the central figure of the girls’ group who stand out in the class spoke to Sensei with the same casualness as she would with friends.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mayuzumi-san is a typical bright and lively gal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She has long black hair tied up in twin tails, with a purple inner color mixed in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As flashy as her appearance appears to be, she’s high-energy and light-hearted, and with her straightforward and unpretentious personality, she has many friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite being at the top of the class hierarchy, her open-minded nature allows her to talk to everyone without concern for group boundaries.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She chats with the popular crowd, learns from the studious group, gets hyped with the sports team crowd, and engages in heated discussions about anime and games with the otaku group.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Good news, Gal-friendly Otaku really does exist!</p>

<p class="calibre4">Such is Mayuzumi-san, who genuinely admires our homeroom teacher, Reiyu Tenjō.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just like Mayuzumi-san, many female students gather around Tenjō-sensei during breaks and after school, asking for her beauty secrets and consulting about love.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s not true. The boys are enthusiastic about their studies and often ask questions.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“They just want to chat with Reiyu-chan Sensei, don’t they?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a smile, Mayuzumi-san sees through the boys’ modest aggressiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Stop it, don’t expose the chicken hearts of guys who can’t speak without a reason!</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sensed the boys who got hit in the mark clutching their chests behind me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Having common topics makes conversation easier. Study, love, work, in any scene, it’s better and more fun when the conversation flows.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her choice of straightforward manner words and persuasiveness is undoubtedly also one of the reasons why Tenjō-sensei is popular with both boys and girls.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now, Nishiki-kun, are you done writing?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei checked on me as I was inadvertently admiring her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, not yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come on, concentrate. You’re looking over here too much. Is there something strange about me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei checked her appearance. Even her casual gestures were alluring.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What to do, should I suddenly ask about last night’s incident here?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, don’t go silent on me. It makes me worried.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s nothing. Actually, I was just mesmerized by Sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My deliberately joking comment caused the whole class to burst into laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“See, I told you!” Mayuzumi-san’s bright voice rang out clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I think about it again, probing during class is a bad move.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If the neighbor really is Sensei, having this fact known to my classmates would be inconvenient both for me and for Sensei.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just make sure you do it in moderation,” she says with ease, brushing off my words lightly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, I have something else I want to consult about.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While moving my hand, I decided to try a different kind of question.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s troubling you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The thing is, this seat makes it hard for me to doze off in class.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…You’ve got some nerve, Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei was dumbfounded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She didn’t seem as angry as her words might imply though.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei’s Japanese history classes are interesting, so I stay awake.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not just in my class, make sure you’re awake for all subjects.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But getting enough sleep is important.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I guess that’s also true.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She agreed quite emphatically.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, are you not getting enough sleep?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Most working adults don’t get enough sleep.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Speaking as if representing all working adults, Sensei complained.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Adults and children alike need to lead healthy lives. Sleep, exercise, diet, relaxation&mdash;all are important. Otherwise, you might make mistakes in important decisions.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hearing that kind of talk makes me don’t want to work.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can’t be a high school student forever.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If Sensei wore a uniform, she’d easily pass as a JK. (High schooler)”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I imagine Reiyu Tenjō in a girls’ high school uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yeah, she’d easily pass for an active JK, it probably suits her so well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Man, I’d kind of like to see that…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What kind of nonsense is that?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei, looking displeased, leans forward to peer into my face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">With her face so close, I unintentionally look away and cast my eyes down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And where my gaze fled, an even more provocative scene awaited.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Beneath the blouse that seems about to burst are two things presenting an overwhelming presence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Their size is something that my classmates simply cannot match.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s just too mature.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Moreover, unbeknownst to her as she leans forward, Sensei’s cleavage is pressed against the edge of the desk due to her posture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This stimulation is too intense.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It means not to worry too much about age. Everyone has a youthful side within themselves.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My birthday was in April, and when I turned seventeen, Sensei was still just twenty-three years old.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks to her willingness to engage in such trivial conversations, I don’t feel much of an age difference.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if you say that, you’re just a teenage boy…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As she straightens up, her chest sways. Well, maybe she’s too mature to pass as a high school student.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Doesn’t Sensei have moments when you feel like a child again?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Such as?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Like when eating food you’ve loved since you were a child? What’s your favorite food, Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Strawberries, I guess.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Asked directly, Tenjō-sensei answers like that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, what a coincidence, I also like strawberries. Just last night, I received some strawberries from my neighbor, and they were incredibly delicious.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As if I had been waiting just for this moment, I hinted at last night’s events in a roundabout way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“──I think we’ve talked too much. Okay, let’s get back to the lesson.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a face that looked like she wanted to say something, Sensei unnaturally changed the topic and began erasing part of the writing on the blackboard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her reaction was very suspicious.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">Strategy number three: returning Cinderella’s lost glass slipper.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Given her reaction during the history class, it’s almost certain that my neighbor is Reiyu Tenjō.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a move to give the final push, I resorted to a more assertive approach.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, I had brought to school the sandal that my neighbor had dropped last night.</p>

<p class="calibre4">When lunch break came, I took it with me to the staff room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Excuse me. Tenjō-sensei, could I have a little of your time?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“N-Nishiki-kun!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei was so surprised to see me that she nearly fell off her chair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then she immediately noticed that the bag I had put the sandal in was the same department store paper bag that had contained the strawberries from last night.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We’ll use the student guidance room. Nishiki-kun, come with me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei pulled my arm and led me to the student guidance room next to the staff room with a stern face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After locking the door behind us with a click, Tenjō-sensei turned to glare at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you trying to threaten me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asked angrily, in a hushed voice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Threaten? That’s an exaggeration. I just came to return something that was forgotten. And while I was at it, I thought I’d confirm if my neighbor was Sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I took a seat on one side of the long table placed in the center of the room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You could have just hung it on the doorknob at home! Why bring it all the way to school?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see, so my neighbor is Tenjō-sensei?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I asked for confirmation, Sensei gasped with an ‘Ah!?’ as if holding her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was right.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You seem quiet, but you’re actually quite bold, huh? I’m surprised.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know I’m bothering you. But it must be inconvenient to only have one sandal, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not the point.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei, unable to hide her agitation, lacked the composed demeanor she usually displayed in the classroom.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, we’re actually facing a big problem here. Then Sensei, you ran away last night because you want to keep your identity a secret, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Of course.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As if it were the most obvious thing in the world, Sensei crossed her arms.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I understand that you want to keep things secret. But think about it calmly. It’s honestly tough to spend every day until graduation knowing that Sensei lives next door.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even with zero interaction, it makes me restless to know that my homeroom teacher lives just a wall away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s true for me, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now that we know, we should at least have a minimal discussion to protect each other’s privacy. It would be awkward for you too, wouldn’t it, if you had a boyfriend stay over and then run into me the next day?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wouldn’t want to encounter such a situation either. It would make things awkward.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t have a boyfriend!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei’s ears turned red, seemingly embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had only meant to give an example, but the reaction was more than I expected.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I was genuinely curious, I thought it would be rude to pry any further and let it slide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I felt relieved to know that Sensei didn’t have a boyfriend.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not even a prince from Cinderella’s story…I never expected there would actually be someone who would find me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei took a seat on the opposite side while seemingly resigned.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, Sensei, about the specifics…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be in a hurry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She gestures as if to say ‘stay,’ holding out her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;This is school, so let’s keep our private conversations outside of it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She firmly draws a line with a clear-cut attitude that work and private life are completely separate.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright. When would be good for you? I’ll adjust to Sensei’s schedule.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I want to sort out the situation as soon as possible, but Sensei is busy with work, and she probably has plenty of invitations for dates.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well… Let’s see, when would be good…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei’s responses are hesitant.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…You’re not trying to run away again, are you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course not.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She blatantly averts her eyes as if I’ve hit the mark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s suspicious. Make up your mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright, fine! I’ll come over tonight! Happy now? But I have to work late, so you’ll have to forgive me for that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Was it something that required such determination?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay as long as you come. I live alone, so I can be flexible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, you’re a high school student living alone!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I nod, Sensei’s expression grows even more stern.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, I don’t mean to assume, but do you have a problem with going to a boy’s place who lives alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re a teacher and a student! There’s no way I’d be conscious of that!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She denies it vehemently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, it makes sense that she wouldn’t consider me, her student, as a man.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Let’s change our perspective here. Sensei is just going to counsel a student who happens to live in the same neighborhood.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What kind of consultation?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei, I’m actually struggling with how to interact with my neighbor. Please lend me your help.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to reveal my concerns with a serious expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, I am merely giving advice to a student, after all. Right, it’s like an impromptu home visit!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei was emphasizing as if to convince herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Fine. Let’s clear things up tonight.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright. Then, I’ll just return the sandal to you for now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I offer the paper bag respectfully.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Showing her conscientious nature, she properly expresses her gratitude at the end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s confirmed: my neighbor is Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">After getting home from school, I quickly tidied up my room and then started preparing dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tonight’s menu is curry rice with a side salad and soup.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As the cooking is finished, the room’s intercom rings just in time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I head towards the entrance, take a small deep breath, and slowly unlock the door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good evening, Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei stands there with a somewhat stiff expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good evening. Sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to appear as natural as possible.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry I’m late.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, don’t worry about it…don’t you seem tense?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her confident demeanor from school has subdued and she seems somewhat awkward.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah!? N-no, it’s not like that. I’m normal!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She waves her hands frantically, denying it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A home visit at night…are you nervous?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t make it sound so suggestive.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She pouted her lips.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“First, let me confirm! This isn’t some kind of bad prank or hidden camera show, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Brushing off my nonsense, she asks again with a cautious look, even though she knows it’s a bit much.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I assure you, this is genuinely my room, number 102.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And I am in 103. So, that means…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’re an actual neighbors.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I state the conclusion, Tenjō-sensei held her head.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just too absurd that a student coincidentally lives next door to me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei exclaims with a voice close to tears.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, these things happen sometimes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but laugh at the miraculous coincidence.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This isn’t funny at all! What should we do!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s why you came over, to talk.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, why are you acting so… normal about this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei seems dissatisfied with our difference in reactions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even with a sulky face, she gave off a charming impression.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was older than me, but she was so endearing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I am surprised that my homeroom teacher is my neighbor, but as a guy, I also think I’m lucky to have a beautiful woman living next door.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I answer her honestly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re so carefree.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not really, I was observing all day because I wasn’t sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve been looking at me too much! I was really on edge the whole time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She didn’t seem that way at all in class.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s admirable that you can still stay in work mode. I think that’s really cool.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, you’re very eloquent, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was strictly taught by my mother to always express good thoughts directly to the other person.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s nice. I agree with that way of thinking.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei’s expression had relaxed more than before after she found a point she could relate to.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Looks like you’ve relaxed a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you perhaps teasing me on purpose?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s making me nervous too to talk informally to someone older.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I shrugged my shoulders lightly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How pathetic. To be worried by a child…I’m still immature.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her exasperated expression was somehow attractive.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, how long have you been living here?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She shifted the topic, trying to move the conversation forward.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since I started high school. I’ve been living here for over a year.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I moved to this apartment when I got the job.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, if you’re renting a place considering the commute to school, it makes sense it would be in this area.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Even so, it’s not just the closest station, but the same apartment building. It’s strange we haven’t met each other until now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wholeheartedly agree.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I would have preferred it if you hadn’t noticed me until you graduated.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But now that I know, you can’t ignore it. That’s why you came, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because what you said made sense.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei spoke as if resigned&mdash;then the sound of a growling stomach interrupted us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The noise wasn’t mine. Startled, Tenjō-sensei touched her stomach with an embarrassed look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why don’t we stop standing around and have some food while we talk at my room?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even though it is early spring, the nights are still cold. I’d would feel bad if she caught a cold.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s only natural for Tenjō-sensei to hesitate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even I’d be hesitant to give an immediate answer if our roles were reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it would be better than me, a male student, were to go to her, a female teacher’s apartment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tonight’s dinner is curry. Do you dislike curry?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I love curry, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I made a lot, so don’t hold back. It’s hard to have a calm conversation on an empty stomach.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Still, this feels wrong…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Think of it as a return for the strawberries.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I told you, you don’t need to worry about it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei doesn’t refuse because she understands the need for a talk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, it’s natural that the psychological hurdle is high.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Let me make it clear, my wish is to continue living a peaceful life as before. I have no weird intentions of threatening you or anything like that, so please be assured.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I try to ease her reluctance by assuring her of my harmless intentions.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really&mdash;?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m met with a skeptical look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I won’t lay a finger on you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I respond immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, I’m also a man. If a woman enters my room, to say that I wouldn’t hope for a sweet development would be a lie.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I don’t have that kind of boldness, nor do I have the confidence to handle such a situation well if it did arise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, dreaming about it surely can’t be a crime.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright, I’ll trust you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō finally let her guard down and showed me a genuine smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A full-faced smile from such a close distance is too powerful. It makes my heart flutter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned to the side blinded by her brightness, covering my mouth with my hand to hide a smile that was about to leak out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please, come in.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…Sorry for disturbing you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei hesitantly enters the entranceway and awkwardly removes her shoes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;&mdash;Reiyu Tenjō has come to my room.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wow, you keep it clean. Impressive that there’s not a speck of dust in the entrance or hallway.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei looked around with interest.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry for the cramped small room…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know, I’m your neighbor. The layout is exactly the same.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that so?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Having a woman in my room makes my heart race.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is your room this tidy so you can invite girls over anytime you want?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei makes a suggestive remark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Unfortunately, there are no girls I could invite over.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh. Nishiki-kun, I thought a guy like you would have a girlfriend.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I had a girlfriend, I certainly wouldn’t invite other women over.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, what a gentleman. Any girl who becomes your girlfriend can rest easy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I head to the kitchen in the hallway to prepare Sensei’s portion of dinner.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, you can just take a seat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll help you with something.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei stayed at the border between the room and the hallway, looking hesitant.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s no need really, it’s just serving the curry on the plate. Oh, do you have any preference for the amount of curry or rice?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll have a larg&mdash;&mdash;no, actually, just a regular serving.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Whether it’s a maiden’s shyness or an adult’s restraint, she’s about to blurt ‘large’ but corrects herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay. a large serving it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I intuit what she wants and take out a plate, opening the lid of the rice cooker.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“People need to replenish energy for the amount they move. It’s because after coaching the swim team rigorously after school, I haven’t eaten anything!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s natural to be hungry after nine at night, but from Sensei’s tone, it seems she also swims extensively herself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do advisors have to swim a lot?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I had assumed that as an advisor, her main jobs were to supervise by the poolside, give swimming instructions, and ensure safety.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps she also swims to demonstrate techniques.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Maybe because I like swimming myself. It helps me keep in shape.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She put her hands on her waist with a look of pride as if to show off her own style.</p>
<p class="calibre4">True to her words, her slender figure is emphasized with beautiful curves that gracefully rise and fall.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, what do you usually do for dinner?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I put a generous amount of white rice onto the plate.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’d prefer to cook for myself every day, but I’ve been eating out or just buying something to eat lately.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I guess it’s difficult for working adults to manage household chores on weekdays.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sick of a life that’s just going back and forth between home and work, and being in a room where the chores aren’t done just makes me feel even more depressed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei must like things to be clean.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For her to lament this much means she’s feeling a little overwhelmed by her current situation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A house gets dirty if you leave it alone, but it never gets tidy on its own, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right! There’s just not enough time, especially for busy working people.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Working adults deeply lament the lack of time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you taking time off to relax properly? Like going out on weekends or devoting yourself to some hobbies?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“On my days off, I’m just trying to recover my energy…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei’s eyes look empty as she continues,</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sleep is one of the three basic human needs, after all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I started to feel worried.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Come to think of it, during today’s history class, when the topic of lack of sleep came up, Sensei seemed to relate very strongly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In this day and age, the whole society is so hard-pressed. Sleeping might be becoming the ultimate luxury.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a strained laugh with a dead-eyed smile, Sensei snaps back to reality.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“──What am I doing, complaining to a student…Sorry, just ignore everything I said.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s too late to say that now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The Reiyu Tenjō I knew during the day was beautiful, brimming with confidence, always smiling, and bright.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had assumed she was born into many blessings, fulfilled, loved, and leading a shining life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, even a beauty like Sensei also has ordinary problems.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Realizing this simple truth made the person I admired feel a little closer to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“At least satisfy your appetite as much as you can.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I ladled curry sauce from the pot, pouring it generously over the rice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wiped off any curry that had spilled onto the rim of the plate with a clean cloth, then placed it on a tray.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Here you go Sensei, your curry. Can you bring the salad and soup to the table?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, it looks delicious. You’ve even got the side dishes all set.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed excited after being entrusted with the tray full of food.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I dished out my own curry and carried it to the table.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you for preparing everything, Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei thanked me as she sat down on a cushion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but stare intently at the scene before me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The idea of a beautiful girl like Tenjō-sensei eating normally in my room felt unbelievably out of the ordinary.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, what’s wrong? Come sit down.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Prompted by her, I took my seat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry to keep you waiting. Please go ahead and eat it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then, itadakimasu.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei put her hands together before starting her meal with good manners.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I found myself watching her, curious about her reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a moment charged with tension.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Nishiki-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re staring too much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s hard to eat when someone is staring at me like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, I’m not used to having someone other than my family eat my cooking.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry. I can tell how good you are just by how carefully you’ve plated the food.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She smiles as if to approve of my cooking skills.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, Sensei takes her first bite.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“──Hng.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She lets out a small noise, and her eyes widen. Her lips briefly twist into a slight frown.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She chews slowly, savoring the taste as if she wants to thoroughly enjoy the food.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her reaction is reminiscent of a baby tasting new food for the first time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After swallowing, she remains motionless, spoon in hand, and staring at the curry on her plate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The mysterious tension paralyzes me. What is this reaction from Sensei about?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it bad?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Were the ingredients not cooked properly?</p>

<p class="calibre4">But I’ve made curry many times before, so there shouldn’t be any mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe the store-bought medium-hot curry roux is too spicy for Sensei?</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, she doesn’t reach for the cup of barley tea as if in need of relief.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t like it, you can spit it out. The bathroom is over there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei finally spoke just as I was about to offer both the cup of barley tea and a box of tissues in case of the worst.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s really delicious. Nishiki-kun, you’re a genius! I could eat this forever!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She praises me with a beaming smile and pats my shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I let out a sigh of relief and say,</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re too absorbed in the taste.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I just wanted to fully savor the first bite.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a pleasure to see her happily munching on the curry I made.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad it’s to your taste.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Happy that she likes it, I finally start eating my own curry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just like the kind of home-cooked meal you’d want to eat every day. Whoever becomes your wife is going to be very lucky, Nishiki-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei jokingly says such things in high spirits.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, you could eat it every day if you wanted to.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey now, are you trying to woo me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The adult Onee-san winks teasingly at me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just mean that being neighbors, you could come over to eat whenever you feel like it. It would be too cocky of me to try and woo Tenjō-sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I clarify to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ahaha, I’m just kidding. There’s no way you would be interested in someone older like me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei laughs it off as if it’s impossible and continues to eat her curry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei is exactly my type. I like you, and if I could, I’d be happy to date you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I declare my feelings openly and without concealment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What are you saying with such a serious face!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei is more than surprised; she’s shocked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, rather than trying to hide my feelings and acting suspiciously, I thought it’s better to tell you that I’m interested from the start to avoid any misunderstandings.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t have enough experience to play the game of love.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Despite the fear, I decided to be honest so she wouldn’t misunderstand me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then thank you. As my student, I like you too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It seems we have mutual feelings, then.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes-yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can like me as a member of the opposite sex too if you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be waiting for the day your feelings change.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Are you being assertive!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m not lying though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…It’s also true that I really like your cooking, Nishiki-kun. It’s not just flattery.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei’s response was kind of funny.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“For now, I’m satisfied with that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re really coming on strong.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m the kind of guy who deliberately delivers forgotten items and asks for a meal in return. Looks like you’ve been smoothly brought into a home date, haven’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, that makes you sound like such a player.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei was amused by my candid response.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Anyway, please help yourself to more curry without any reservations, Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Really? Then I’ll take you up on that offer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She quickly finished off the remaining curry on her plate.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How much would you like for seconds?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Regular serving for the rice and a little extra curry, please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This time she communicated what she wanted honestly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way she innocently pleaded for more was cute.</p>

<p class="calibre3">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, that was delicious. I think I can’t move for a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei lay on the bed and seemed relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a late dinner, the room filled with a peaceful atmosphere as our stomachs were full.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Should I make some warm tea?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Such thorough service. It feels like I’m at a fancy hotel.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The room layout is the same as next door’s though.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but laugh at her exaggerated expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The comfort level changes with the owner. I just didn’t expect it to be so comfortable.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can rest here as much as you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You have a way of spoiling people that makes them useless.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not my intention, though.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know. I guess it’s because you do it so naturally that I can relax without hesitation. It’s been a long time since I’ve been able to relax like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei looked very sleepy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m happy to see a new side of Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Disappointed?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not at all. My affection for you has skyrocketed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ahaha. If I were a perfect person, I wouldn’t have made the mistake of sharing food with my student next door.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not a mistake, it might have been fate.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fated to be neighbors who help each other out? A classic kind of relationship.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s easier than avoiding each other.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fufu, I’m touched by my student’s kindness.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, thank you for your hard work this week.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“────”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At my casual remark, she suddenly stopped speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thinking it was a pause in the conversation, I started gathering the empty plates to take them to the kitchen&mdash;&mdash;then I froze.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Sensei, are you okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I asked softly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei herself hadn’t yet realized something was amiss.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re crying&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I pointed out, hesitating to put it into words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tears silently rolled down Reiyu Tenjō’s white cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a somewhat fleeting expression, tears kept overflowing from her eyes continuously.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m crying…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei finally realized she was crying at my words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What, why? That’s strange…”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00009.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">She was wiping her cheek with her finger, but tears continued to fall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I grabbed a tissue box from beside the pillow and went over to her side to hand it to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry about this,” Sensei awkwardly tried to force a smile and hide her true feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sniffling, she wiped her eyes with several tissues, but her tears wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was like her emotions hadn’t caught up with her body’s reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as she became aware that she was crying, her sobs turned into wails.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sensei looked very troubled from the embarrassment of crying in front of others and confusion over the unstoppable tears.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“～～～～Ahh, I’m so pathetic!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Forcing herself to be spirited, she tried to rouse herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she looked up at the ceiling, saying “Hold back your tears!” transparent droplets trailed down her neck.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s better to cry when you feel like crying.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Setting aside the guilt of having seen a woman cry, I spoke to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her words were blurred by her tears. (TN: Saying goben instead of gomen)</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t apologize. It’s hard to hold it in.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…but I’m an adult.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She tried to hide her face with her arms, not wanting her student to see her crying so hard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s no law that says adults can’t cry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My words made her cry even more again.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, is there anything I can do for you? There’s no need to pretend to be cool now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t just stand by. I naturally felt that way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can you keep everything a secret?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asked hesitantly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes. It’s our secret from now on.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then…stroke my head.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her adorable request made her, an older woman, seem like a young girl.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thanks to that, I was able to boldly reach out to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Feeling her hair in my palm, I gently stroked her head to comfort her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You really stroked it…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll stop.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll do what you want until you feel better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“────”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Reiyu Tenjō openly accepted my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her shoulders trembled, and, unable to hold back any longer, she pressed her forehead against my shoulder, hiding her face as she sobbed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We awkwardly lean against each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus, I silently continued to stroke her head until her tears stopped.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun, sorry to keep you waiting. You can come in now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Called by Sensei, I, who had been out in the hallway, returned to the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though her tears had stopped, I had stepped out for a while until she calmed down.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I made some tea if you’d like some.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah. That’s nice.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her response was much quieter, likely due to exhaustion from crying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tenjō-sensei’s eyes were still bright red, and the nearby trash bin was filled with tissues.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She wrapped her hands around the mug of warm tea, blowing on it to cool it down.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sat beside her, quietly waiting for Sensei to start talking while sipping tea.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry you had to see me like that earlier. Please, forget everything.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a while, she spoke.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a secret that Sensei is in my room, so I won’t tell anyone.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wouldn’t say it because I don’t want people to suspect anything.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Also, no one would believe it anyway.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right. Ah, I’m glad our conversation is a secret. I was really out of my mind earlier.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei forced a cheerful voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, her voice was hoarse from crying, making her fake-cheerfulness obvious.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Can I ask a question?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Go ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why did you cry?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I asked bluntly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you really want to know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course. I want to know everything about Sensei.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That seems to mean something different to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t explain, my biggest high school memory will be stroking Sensei’s head while she cried at my house.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I deliberately brought up what Sensei was trying to avoid.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s a no-no! Forget it! I just got weak and spoiled myself! I think it was too careless of me, but I couldn’t help it! It’s not like it had a deep meaning or that I have special feelings for you or anything…!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She stammered, desperately making excuses.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry if I made you uncomfortable.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you forgive me, can we just call it even and move on?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I suggested a resolution by asking for her forgiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instead of agreeing, she began to explain why she cried.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“While you were waiting in the hallway…I thought about why I cried.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you get an answer?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe…I was moved by your cooking.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t make fun of me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s the truth.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei confessed in a whisper.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…It’s been a very long time since I had someone’s homemade cooking.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Sigh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I struggled to understand, Sensei continued to speak.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You see, curry made by professionals outside is delicious, but homemade curry at home is something different, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, the ingredients, equipment, and skills are different, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. But for me now, your home-cooked meal was comforting. And before I knew it, I couldn’t stop my tears…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei had a somewhat relieved expression.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Your cooking was so sweet to me. It’s a simple, unpretentious meal made by an ordinary person that felt warm and made me happy; I think it gradually threw off my tension, and then your ‘thank you for your hard work’ was the last straw. I probably wanted someone to recognize my hard work…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei confessed, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’ve been under a lot of pressure, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When you start living alone, you rarely get words of appreciation that aren’t just out of habit or politeness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I understand that from my own experience.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Entering my second year of work, there’s more to do, and I have to make more decisions on my own. But because I lack experience, I’m not very efficient, and often it’s difficult.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It seems there were various tensions and struggles that were invisible to the students when she first took charge of a class.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though she’s an adult, Reiyu Tenjō is still in her early twenties.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s easy to forget, but she’s only been a teacher for a year. And as a working adult, she’s still a newcomer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No one is perfect from the start.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s natural to get tired if you work hard.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I remember the scene when I first saw Sensei in the staff room a year ago.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess so. I was surprised to find out how little leeway I had left.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re doing a great job as a Sensei.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even a swan seen gliding gracefully on the water is actually moving its feet frantically under the water.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She simply maintains a composed expression all the time so as not to let anyone realize that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I’m ashamed that I didn’t even realize Sensei was having such a hard time that she would cry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve seen my worst side…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her tense face relaxed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now that I’ve seen your worst side, one or two more bad sides won’t change anything.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t threaten me just because you have something on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s not a bad idea. If I start skipping school and seem like I’m going to repeat a grade, I’ll use it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Before that, I’ll take you to school every morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei flashed me a mischievous smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t that too generous? There’s no need for Sensei to care for her students beyond the school grounds.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t leave it alone now that I know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Being neighbors is inconvenient, huh? I can’t easily skip school.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re not the type to do that, are you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At the end of our silly banter, Sensei and I burst out laughing at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Laughing together lightened the atmosphere of the room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, it’s nice to have someone to talk to after coming home,”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei mused deeply.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been a while since I’ve had dinner with someone at home too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As Sensei gradually regained her composure, she started to vent.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Because I’m new, I get loaded with all sorts of chores besides my own work, and I’ve also been staying late because of club activities. I rarely get to leave on time these days.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s impossible to do housework if you’re always coming home late, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I nodded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a student, I only manage household chores after school hours.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I were in clubs, on committees, taking additional lessons, or working part-time, I’d have to resort to convenience store meals or eating out for dinner too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Exactly! All I can do at the end of the day is just to get home. Plus, in a dark, empty room, there’s no one to say ‘welcome back’ to me. It’s really lonely!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can somehow relate to that. You end up talking to yourself more than necessary if you’re living alone.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I could empathize with the common experiences of living alone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s empty, just emptiness. It’s something created by the darkness of my heart. That’s how my weekdays go, just coming home to sleep. On weekends, I sleep until noon to recover, and by the time I finish catching up on chores, the day is over, and before I know it, it’s Monday again.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She vented her pent-up frustrations as if casting a curse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed Sensei was on the edge as a working adult, more than I had imagined.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you for your hard work…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was nothing else I could say.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to that, my QOL is plummeting, and I feel like I’m about to die!” (TN: quality of life.)</p>

<p class="calibre4">‘Laugh if you want,’ says Sensei with a sense of resignation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If it’s that hard, don’t you ever think of quitting being a teacher?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course not. I haven’t even seen my first graduates off yet. Can I just quit easily?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yet, light and determination returned to her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m sure these were words from her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">People who strive towards their ideals with such effort like her are too dazzling.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While eating strawberries previously shared by Sensei, we passed the time with trivial conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stood up to make another pot of green tea, having finished the last.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Waiting for the water to boil, I decided to bring up the main topic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We should establish some rules to avoid any troubles that could arise from being neighbors with Tenjō-sensei and to smoothly continue school life while protecting our privacy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In fact, it was also necessary for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If things continued this way, I felt I might lose my self-control as a man.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was hopelessly nervous but also excited.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How bold of me…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even if she had been crying, to stroke the head of an older woman!</p>
<p class="calibre4">And not just any woman, but Reiyu Tenjō! My homeroom teacher! My neighbor!</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment I was alone in the hallway, I was internally in agony without making a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As the new tea was ready, I gathered my courage and went back to the room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Seriously?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei was quietly breathing in her sleep. She was sleeping soundly, leaning against the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of course you’d be sleepy after a day’s work, a big meal, and crying a lot.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She lay there, vulnerable and peaceful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt a bit guilty to glance at a woman’s sleeping face, but this was my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s her fault for falling asleep here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I quietly placed the tea on the table and watched Reiyu Tenjō’s sleeping face for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even her sleeping face is cute. That’s so unfair.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was so beautiful it was mesmerizing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked relaxed and happy, perhaps having a pleasant dream.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But falling asleep in a guy’s room, isn’t that a bit too careless?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It made me worry.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really, I guess Sensei really doesn’t have a romantic interest in her students.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt a little hurt, wondering what to do next.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had been thinking about Sensei all day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I’ll feed bad if I forcibly wake her up. I’ll let her be for a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She would probably wake up on her own eventually.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll do the dishes first. By the time I’m done, she’ll probably wake up and go back to her room.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s what I thought.</p>
