<h3>Short Story 2</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time as Reito’s victory over Gain…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haah&#8230;what’s wrong with me, honestly&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first princess of the Baltros kingdom and captain of the Valkyrja Knights —  Nao was in her lodging in the Adventure City of Lunot, sighing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had arrived in Lunot a few days prior, but not one day passed without at least a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not good. As they say, to sigh means to run away. Aah, why am I always thinking of him…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main cause behind Nao’s sighs was the boy she met a few days before, Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a hopeless job holder, he had befriended a White Wolf; he was just a Support Magician but could use powerful combination spells.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He too lived in this town, so she could probably see him if she wanted to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, however, had come to Lunot in order to find a certain person: her subordinates, the other Valkyrja knights were currently investigating the whereabouts of the person in question. It would not be appropriate for Nao to act on her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn’t keep her mind off that boy, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s gotten over me&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was still young, but he was still a man. Nao was confused and perplexed by how often her thoughts drifted to him. She had the curious feeling that he wasn’t a stranger to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite her general dislike of men, she did not find Reito repulsive at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt he was similar to her little sisters, which only made her more inclined to look after him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Calm down, Nao&#8230;focus on the mission&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to properly fulfill her role as captain of the Valkyrja Knights. While she was a princess, her position was not certainly a pampered one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao hated monsters — more precisely, she was deathly scared of them. The reason why she could be a knight captain, despite such a disadvantageous trait, was not that she was the princess, but because she had achieved significant feats, outside of monster extermination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Excuse me, Princess!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Finally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A black-haired knight entered the room without even knocking. Nao did not rebuke her but simply stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The visitor was the vice-captain of the Valkyrja Knights and Nao’s attendant, Rinon. She was one of the best swordswomen of the band, on par with Nao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, Rinon was not wearing the Valkyrjas’ uniform right now: in order to blend on with Lunot’s population, she had bought civilian clothes at the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As you predicted, Princess, there have been eyewitness reports of a female Necromancer. Apparently, she visited an informant in this city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An informant&#8230;a rat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and the Valkyrja knights were trying to track down the Necromancer but did not know her name: their only clue was a portrait based on her likeness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She really came here, then. That informant is&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dead, unfortunately&#8230;they were killed as soon as they sold her the information she wanted. The body was left in a back alley, stuffed inside a wooden crate.”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-9-87564908' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-9-87564908' data-code='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' data-block='9'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='9' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tch, we got here too late…! But she should still be in the city. Continue the search.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Princess!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, right&#8230;contact the Black Tigers’ guildmaster too. We might have to petition them for help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Yes, right away&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinon was taken aback by Nao’s order but quickly left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao stood up, took the two cutlasses leaning against the wall, and hung them from her waist. She then gave orders to the petite knight standing by in front of her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Laika, I’m going out. Come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Auf! With pleasure!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laika was a young dog-type Beastman. Nao patted her head and they left together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, she would wait to hear the reports from other knights too, but as there were already casualties, Nao couldn’t just stand still and do nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm, hm&#8230;I smell something good!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s almost time for lunch, isn’t it. We don’t have time to sit around and eat, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;we can buy something from a street stall on the way, I suppose&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beastmen and Giants required more food than the average Human, so it was more painful for them to endure an empty stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao started walking down the street, one eye on finding a street stall fitting to fill Laika’s stomach, and noticed that the city was more crowded than usual: compared to her last visit, there were more tourists around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Hunting Festival will be held soon, won’t it. Hopefully, our mission will be done by then&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hum?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve never heard of it, Laika? It’s a monster hunting event held in this town during this season.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hunting Festival was held every year in Lunot, in the season when monsters reproduced the most, organized jointly by the Adventurers’ Guilds and monster traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All sorts of monsters are let loose in the city, and the adventurers compete by defeating as many as possible. The citizens and tourists watch it as a show, so it’s called the Hunting Festival.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really okay to let monsters loose in the city, though?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They take the necessary safety precautions, of course. Barrier and Decay stones to limit the monsters’ movement, royal guards positioned in strategic locations&#8230;the spectators watch from a specific area, and the monsters are controlled by Tamers anyway, so there’s no real danger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see, I see~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laika happily wagged her tail as she listened, so Nao couldn’t help but smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Valkyrjas’ captain quickly focused again on her mission, scanning the crowd for any suspicious individuals, and noticed that they were attracting a bit too much attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey&#8230;that’s the Valkyrja Knights’ uniform, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You mean those girls are knights!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why would knights be in a place like this?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-1' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, we stand out too much like this&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Awooh! I had no idea!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao had instructed the knights to change their outfits in order to blend in with the crowd but forgot to do the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, Nao and Laika found a used clothing store and tried various outfits, based on the clerk’s recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Milady, you absolutely must try this one next!! It’s a dress based on the famous “goth lolita” fashion, designed by a summoned hero&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-how could I wear something like that!? Bring me something else!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Miss, what do you think of this? This outfit too was designed by a hero, based on certain mystical priestesses&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it’s so cute!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Laika!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The female clerks brought clothes upon clothes for Nao and Laika to try, almost turning them into dress-up dolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao just wanted to buy clothes that would allow them not to stand out, but she had probably picked the wrong store: the clerks kept recommending outfits that did not match her plans in the slightest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How about this one, then!? This swimsuit is very popular with mermaids too!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you really expect me to wear that in public!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In that case&#8230;this bikini armor would look great on you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you to bring me clothes!! Clothes!! Why do you even sell stuff like that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Very well, I must recommend you this “tracksuit”, then. It is very comfy and easy to move in!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is there a single normal outfit in this store!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For whatever reason, the store sold a wide variety of clothing inspired by other worlds’ outfits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Nao and Laika bought a relatively “normal” sailor uniform and jersey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They ended up spending one hour just to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What am I even doing&#8230;if I knew things were going to turn like this, I would have stayed at the inn&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aun&#8230;please cheer up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao was huddled down, despite the fact she was wearing a skirt, so Laika put a hand on her shoulder and tried to console her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao soon made her resolve, however: she had changed her outfit, one way or the other, so there was no choice but to go gather information from the townspeople.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no point in feeling down, is it!! Let’s go investigate, Laika!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aye-aye!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, her spirits regained, clenched the “Black Crystal Pendant” hanging from her neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A black whirlwind, similar to Reito’s Storage Magic subspace, appeared before her, and she took out a piece of parchment paper from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pendant was indeed a Magic Tool, created from a special Magic Stone called Storage Stone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Stones allowed anyone to store items in dimensional subspaces: they were a very popular kind of Magic Stone, especially among merchants, as they could be used to transport large amounts of goods with little effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existence of Storage Stones was probably the greatest reason why Support Magician, the only Job with natural access to Storage Magic, was considered a worthless one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Stones, however, had various limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Storage Stones subspace had a weight limit: in the case of Nao’s Storage stone, it was only 10 kilograms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Stones also gained weight according to the items placed in the subspace. If the weight limit was 100 kilos and the subspace was filled to the limit, the Storage Stone would become 10 kilos heavier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like Storage Magic, only solid objects could be put into the Storage, so it could not be used to store liquids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storage Stones were extremely convenient, but required an intricate process to be used, so it was not possible to mass produce them and they were rather fragile to boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular Magic Stones were as hard as gemstones, but Storage Stones shared both appearance and hardness with glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incidentally, if a Storage Stone was shattered, all of its contents would be thrown out on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Storage Magic, as long as the user did not die, the Storage subspace could be used freely. The weight limit depended on the user’s level, which increased more slowly compared to other Jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants preferred using Storage Stones rather than relying on Support Magicians, as the stones were much more practical, despite being less effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Phew&#8230;this Storage Stone isn’t convenient at all, is it? Laika, let’s start asking around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes ma’am!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao took out another piece of parchment paper from the subspace, which showed the portrait of the person they were looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The portrait had been drawn by an Appraiser, using the Tech Skills “Quick Brush” and “Reproduction”. It was possible to obtain the Necromancer’s likeness from someone who happened to see her in person, but this collaborator vanished the very next day the portrait was drawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This piece of paper is our only clue&#8230;we have spares, but let’s make sure we don’t lose or damage it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Loud and clear, ma’am! I&#8230;ah&#8230;achoo!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What did I just say!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laika replied energetically, maybe even too much: she ended up sneezing all over the parchment paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, sighing helplessly, took out the spare portrait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photocopiers did not exist in this world: the kingdom’s Appraisers could create new copies of the portrait, however, so there was no real problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bounty poster with the Necromancer’s portrait was soon going to be distributed throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t ruin this one too, okay?”</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-2-55689481' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-2-55689481' data-code='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' data-block='2'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='2' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry&#8230;ah?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like I’ve seen that person before&#8230;oh, it’s that boy from the other day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao turned towards the direction Laika pointed to,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The boy from the other day was surely Reito: Nao, however, could not see him anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked everywhere, to no avail. At the same time, Laika approached a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for picking up my wallet the other day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah&#8230;it’s you, little lady. Don’t mention it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is that!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completely betraying Nao’s expectations, Laika had approached a young Giant man. Laika grabbed his sleeve and introduced him to Nao.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He helped me look for my wallet the other day!! Thank you so so much!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry, really. I can’t just ignore people in trouble.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-is that so&#8230;thank you for helping my subordinate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Subordinate?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, never mind&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Giant, Gonzo, was puzzled by Nao’s words, but patted Laika’s head and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao was sincerely disappointed that the “boy” was not Reito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sigh&#8230;no, wait, what am I sighing about&#8230;I wasn’t expecting anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, it’s that magician boy!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for picking up my money the other day!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? Who&#8230;oh, the dog girl from the other day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who in the world are you!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, Nao was face to face with a stranger. The young man was surprised to be suddenly addressed so aggressively, so Laika explained the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other day, I dropped the coins from my wallet, and this young man helped me pick them up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-is that so&#8230;thanks for helping her&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-it’s nothing&#8230;man, you shocked me&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;please pardon my rudeness, but judging from your appearance&#8230;are you a Dark Magician?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am, so…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao had correctly guessed the young man’s Job, thanks to the typical grey mantle and black robe he wore: only Dark Magicians or Necromancers wore such an attire. She took out the portrait and showed it to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Have you ever seen this person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hm? A portrait? No, I don’t think so&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A-anyway, I have to go now. Don’t you drop your wallet again, you hear?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aye-aye!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man lightly patted Laika’s head and left. Nao sighed after the second bout of betrayed expectations but quickly returned her focus to the mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No good, my concentration is really lacking&#8230;what’s wrong with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, there’s the boy wolf!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It must be him this time!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao heard the word “wolf” and her expectations skyrocketed, but the person Laika was looking at was a young adventurer she had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. wolf!!! Thank you for picking up my sword the other day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm…? Oh, it’s the dog girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ARGH! I don’t know you either!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wha!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young adventurer was a wolf-type Beastman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he was reeling from Nao’s sudden approach, a red-haired girl and a black-haired man appeared from behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s wrong, Garo? Friends of yours?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-no, I barely know them&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, it’s the dog girl we saw the other day. What are you up to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wouf! We’re working!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, Laika&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man behind Garo noticed Laika and spoke to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao quickly put her hands over the dog girl’s mouth, before she could blurt anything else. The other three looked at them funny, so Nao decided to show them the portrait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;actually, we’re looking for this person. Have you ever seen her?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hmm, a portrait…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who is this person anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hey, wait, didn’t we see this woman recently…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you really!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young girl reacted positively to the portrait, so Nao pressed her for details. She did not look completely confident, but nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes, over there&#8230;she went inside that building.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you!! Let’s go, Laika!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes ma’am!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“H-hey, wait!! That building is— ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and Laika ran inside the building the girl pointed at. The moment they were inside, however, they found much more than they could ever expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Welcome, esteemed guests&#8230;oh my, we have some adorable clients today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what is this place…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wah&#8230;the smell of perfume is strong&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and Laika were welcomed by a couple of gorgeous, scantily clad woman, who looked at them curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao then realized they had wandered into a brothel: she blushed fiercely and pulled Laika closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have quite interesting preferences, don’t you? We had another female client just now, if I recall&#8230;in any case, would you like to be served by someone in particular?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-no!! We’re just looking for someone&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry, I understand&#8230;everyone feels compelled to make up excuses at first, but no one would come to a place like this by mistake. We have plenty of girls fitting your preferences, so please rest easy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told you that’s not why I’m here!! Laika, hide behind me!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, wah…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao judged that she couldn’t show such a place to a child, so she ordered Laika to stay behind her. She then took out the Necromancer’s portrait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This woman!! We know she came here!! Does anyone know her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This person…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She came as a client, yes, Are you friends?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;this woman is a criminal. We are affiliated with the kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The kingdom…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The women looked surprised for one moment, then laughed heartily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao was confused by her reaction, but then remembered that they were not wearing their usual uniforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahahaha! Are you really saying you’re soldiers? Our kingdom’s proud warriors, investigating criminals&#8230;dressed like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did mommy never teach you not to make fun of your elders?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-we really are…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Enough, you all. We are not going to give out information regarding our precious clients in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An older woman, probably the owner of the brothel, approached the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She shot an annoyed look at Nao, took a puff from her pipe, and apparently concluded they were not clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re going to get in the way of our business, then leave! We don’t have time to humor little girls playing detective!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;what did you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh my, did that get to your head? I’ll let you know, little lady, that we’re angrier than you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao reacted with an irritated frown to the owner’s belittling of their mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She quickly set her anger aside, however, and took out the pendant hanging from her neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we prove that we really were dispatched from the royal army, will you cooperate with our investigation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;yes, if you can show proper proof, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t forget those words, now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner sneered, but Nao kept her cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then opened her Storage subspace and took out two cutlasses. The women were surprised by the sudden appearance of the two weapons, but Nao ignored them and called Laika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Laika, let’s do that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, yes!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What in the world are you…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laika opened her wallet, took out one coin, and tossed it in Nao’s direction. Nao raised her cutlasses, then performed one of the skills she was most proficient in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cross Blade”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eek!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao swung her cutlasses in front of the owner and her workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin, now split in four, dropped on the floor. As the room fell completely silent, Nao put back her cutlasses, picked up the coin shards, and gave them to the owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here’s the money. Do you believe that we belong to the royal army now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes&#8230;I suppose so. I apologize for doubting you&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No average swordsman could slice a coin in four in midair. It wasn’t exactly proof of belonging to the royal army, but it was more than enough to prove that Nao wasn’t your run-of-the-mill swordsman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao pushed the portrait onto the hands of the awkwardly smiling owner and once again requested her cooperation.</span></p><div class='no-visibility-check ai-check-4-72976624' data-insertion-position='after' data-selector='.ai-check-4-72976624' data-code='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' data-block='4'><span class='ai-check-block ai-cfp' data-ai-block='4' data-ai-cfp-time='1'></span></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bring me to this woman. Before there are any more deaths&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-eek!? Y-yes, immediately! Please, calm down!! You are too young to become a murderer!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Er&#8230;I didn’t mean *I* was going to kill anyone&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The owner, shocked by Nao’s “death sentence”, dropped her pipe and tried to calm her down: as they already caused a commotion, however, there was the chance that the target could escape, so Nao asked another brothel worker to take her to where the Necromancer was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Nao was led to the room where the woman in the portrait was — or more precisely, where a woman closely resembling the female Necromancer on the portrait was. The woman was a Giant, while the female Necromancer was reported to be a Human.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao’s investigation continued until the evening, but she could not find any information of value: eventually, she returned to the inn, helplessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sigh&#8230;today was a tough day, wasn’t it, Laika&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whine&#8230;I’m hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be a good girl, it’s almost time for dinner&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laika plodded behind Nao, her dog ears drooping. Nao patted her head, sighing again at how they ran around the whole day for nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On their way back to the inn, Laika spoke up again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh! It’s the white wolf!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve had enough of that&#8230;who is it this time? A dog-type Beastman?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao turned around after hearing Laika’s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Woof!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whoa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had seen that large wolf before. Nao couldn’t help but react with surprise: riding on the wolf, there was indeed the boy she was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, Nao&#8230;ehm, Princess? Why are you in a place like this…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“R-Reito!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lick lick&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha, that tickles!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ullr, with Reito on his back, had finally appeared before Nao. When Reito hopped down, Ullr started licking Laika’s face, like an adult dog playing with a puppy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you sightseeing&#8230;Princess Nao?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’m on a mission&#8230;what about you? Are you off duty today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Off duty…? Well, more or less, some things happened&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao had heard that Reito became an adventurer: for some reason, seeing that he hadn’t changed from the last time they met made her feel relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concerns hiding in her heart were thus dispelled and Nao regained her usual confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard from Bal, you know. You just joined the guild, but won’t work at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahaha&#8230;I’m doing what I can, actually&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honestly&#8230;I introduced you to her guild, remember? It’ll be bad for my name if it turns out I recommended a slacker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito sincerely bowed his head and Nao smiled wryly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not knowing what to talk about other than work matters, Nao eventually came up with a generic question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So&#8230;how are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Fine, I guess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao realized how Reito’s casual answer gave her great relief. Seeing him safe and sound blew away all of her fatigue and brought a smile to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s good, then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;what about you, Princess?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me? I&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words died in her mouth for a moment. She had many things on her mind recently, but looking at Reito’s face made her feel at ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She answered with a smile, the same smile she had when she talked with her little sisters in the capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m doing great, of course!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several months later&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao, back in the royal capital, finally found information about the female Necromancer. One of her subordinates had found a clue thanks to the portrait, thus they could find the Necromancer’s alleged whereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nao and her knights prepared to finally capture their target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Valkyrja Knights!! Let us depart!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, Princess!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wouf!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leading the beautiful, valiant warriors, Nao rode on to accomplish her mission.</span></p>
