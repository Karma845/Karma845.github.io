<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito was born as the heir to a royal family, but due to his jobs being considered “hopeless”, he ended up expelled from the capital and royal family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and his mother were confined to a residence far away from society, but his misfortunes were not over yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aria, a maid he loved and admired like an older sister, was ordered to take his life; Reito was forced to flee the residence and survive alone in a forest teeming with monsters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living on his own, he focused on training and acquiring skills: he lived in the forest for four years, together with Ullr, a White Wolf he befriended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He finally decided to visit a human settlement when the bounty on his head, known throughout the kingdom, was retracted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On his way, he encountered Nao, the first princess of the Baltros kingdom. She was the captain of the Valkyrja order of knights and also Reito’s cousin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reito joined the Valkyrja knights and traveled with them to the nearest town. He was brimming with excitement, thinking about the adventures that awaited him.</span></p>
