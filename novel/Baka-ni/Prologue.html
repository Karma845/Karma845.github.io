<h1 class="calibre1">Prologue: Sharing</h1>


<p class="calibre4">“I’m home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Living alone, there’s no one to reply when I return to my apartment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My name is Reiyu Tenjō, 23 years old, single, and no boyfriend. I work as a Japanese history teacher at the private Kiyō High School in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This year is my second year, and I’ve become a homeroom teacher for the first time; every day is so busy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After school, I guide the students as the advisor of the swimming club.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even after dismissal time, I return to the staff room to finish grading quizzes and other administrative work.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the time I finish overtime and head home, I’m exhausted.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good job today, ‘me’.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I turn on the light, there’s a garbage bag rolled up in the narrow corridor leading to my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I overslept again this morning, rushed out of the house, and forgot to throw it out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I dodge the annoying garbage bag blocking my way and head to the washbasin.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After washing my hands and gargling, I look up and see my tired face in the mirror. Taking off my contacts brings a sense of freedom along with a slight blur in my vision.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I throw the clothes I wore today and the swimsuit I used for club activities into the washing machine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I change into a camisole, shorts, and an oversized hoodie and finally take a deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I collapse onto the bed as if my strings were cut.</p>

<p class="calibre4">──There are nights when I want to throw everything away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s exactly how I feel right now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The students in my second-year class C are all good kids, but there are some I’m worried about.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One girl has always been very late even though it’s only April.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve warned her several times, but unfortunately, there’s no sign of improvement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder how I can help her…</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel frustrated by my own lack of ability to be a teacher who can support her students.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On top of that, work takes up so much time that I have no room for a private life.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, it’s so hard. I wish I could take a day off tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A monologue named ‘true feelings’ slips out of me unintentionally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I ate out on my way home for dinner, so I felt like I could just go to sleep with this full stomach.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I need to eat the strawberries.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My grandmother from the countryside sent me a lot of high-quality strawberries.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They’ve been my favorite since I was a child, but I’m getting a little tired of them after eating them day after day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They’ll spoil if I don’t eat them soon, but finishing them all by myself seems difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After pondering what to do, I decided to call someone who has been my best friend since high school.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why don’t you come over this weekend to eat some delicious strawberries?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『I can’t, I have a mixer to go to.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She declined so casually with her usual carefree manner, without even a bit of small talk.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Such a heartless best friend. Let’s have a girls’ night out after such a long time~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Spring is the season for new encounters. My schedule is packed with invitations from many men.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t you mistaking spring for all year round?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Reiyu-chan too, you should be a teenage boys’ heart thief in moderation. Aren’t you afraid of being hated or feared by the girls?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her sweet voice, laced with a hint of poison and always polite, is always interesting to hear.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How rude, I am well admired, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Eh, really? Back in high school, the beauty Reiyu-chan was so prickly that everyone was scared of her. Aren’t your students just being considerate, but in fact, actually frightened by you?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t cast unpleasant suspicions on me when I’m already tired.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but feel worried.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『It’s good to care for your students, but you should get a boyfriend already.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m a homeroom teacher from this year, I don’t have time for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『You have time to talk on the phone with me, though?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your fault for picking up my call.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The time had already passed ten o’clock at night.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『I’m currently on my way to the next place with a high-spec gentleman.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re lively even on a Thursday night…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m too exhausted from work to have the energy to go out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『You never know who your destined partner might be. You should increase the number of encounters just in case.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Reiyu-chan, you’ve always had zero interest in romance, it’s such a waste for a beauty like you. You won’t be able to get married.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I received a massive sigh on the other end of the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be helped. I grew up in an environment where my parents were constantly fighting, so I don’t believe in eternal love.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">On top of not being interested, I’m busy with work, so romance is quite low on my list of priorities.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I have the time, I’d rather relax or catch up on household chores that I’ve neglected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Besides, I don’t feel the slightest urge to rush into marriage, so there’s no way I could find a boyfriend.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At least within my current lifestyle, I can’t imagine there being someone who I’d enjoy spending time with.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『What a lonely woman you are.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shut up. I simply don’t dream about romance. I’m realistic.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Isn’t it rather that your standards are too high? For someone like Reiyu-chan, you could have your pick of handsome or wealthy men, yet you’re being too picky.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If happiness could be achieved just by specifications, life wouldn’t be so hard. First of all, someone who’s perfect from the moment you meet them can only get worse later on.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『…says the one with zero dating experience.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmph, romance is all about compatibility and timing. Oh, if I met the right person, I’d date him right away.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hold back my loud voice and brag just a little.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Really~? Well then, why don’t you try contacting the guys from your university seminars? Now that they’re all working adults, maybe some have improved.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Why?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…After graduation, I rejected confessions from each of them. So I’m already out of touch with all of them.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I reluctantly confess.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Even though there have been countless confessions you’ve turned down since high school, the legend of the unsinkable Reiyu Tenjō is still being updated even after becoming a working adult.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">This conversation is practically a gag now, my best friend seemed to struggle to hold back her laughter.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’d fall in love too if I met someone I click with, you know.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There’s no lie there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the very least, in my private life, I want a relationship where I can interact comfortably with someone whose feelings and values align with mine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">More than how highly others regard me objectively, I wanted to cherish a sense of comfort for myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Reiyu-chan, there’s no guarantee that a prince on a white horse will fall in love with you.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend, who diligently attends mixer parties night after night, was quite cynical.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It sounded almost like a sermon, saying that chasing ideals as an adult over twenty is vain.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I know that much. I simply don’t want my life to depend on someone else. I’m going to make myself happy, and I might as well make my partner happy too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『So manly. I’d definitely propose to you if you were a man, Reiyu-chan.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to stay friends, so I’ll pass.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『I’ve been rejected again. You’re about the only one who would turn me down, Reiyu-chan.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but give a wry smile at our unchanged exchanges over the years.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Chatting with a close friend who knows me well is a good pastime.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Listen, Reiyu-chan. It’s fine to work hard, but it’s a different issue to use busyness as an excuse. I want you to learn to take a break and spoil yourself sometimes.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She touches a sore spot with a voice as gentle as a feather’s stroke.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s why I’m on the phone with you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『I really want to see Reiyu-chan falling head over heels in love soon…』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I can meet such a special person, I’ll gladly come to you for love advice.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even I would like to meet someone special as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Maybe someone suitable is closer than you expect? Isn’t there someone nice at school?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She asked with the casualness of asking about tomorrow’s weather.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Workplace romance is absolutely impossible~. Bringing love into the workplace is seriously out of the question.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Really? Having someone you like nearby might add excitement to your work.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would distract me and I wouldn’t be able to concentrate.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『You’re talking like a teenager. That’s why you’re a virgin&mdash;&mdash;』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s got nothing to do with it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I end up raising my voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, with a thud, I heard something fall in the next room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wonder if everything is okay?</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a housing complex, even a small thing can lead to complicated troubles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Living alone in Tokyo, I’ve had absolutely no interaction with the neighbors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t even know the faces or names of the people next door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Reiyu-chan. The partner doesn’t have to be a Sensei, why not a student? Why don’t you captivate a handsome one who looks promising with your nice body?』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I absolutely can’t have a romance with a student.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t help but be astounded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I understand because I see the students every day in class.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No matter how much their height and size resemble adults, they’re still children inside.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『You might be thrilled by the passionate and earnest feelings of a younger guy. There are no absolutes in this world.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d be fired from the school before that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『You look glamorous, Reiyu-chan, but at the core, you’re super serious. Women need to be a bit more aggressive too. Otherwise, it won’t lead to anything even if there’s a chance.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a final piece of advice and ‘I have arrived at my destination’, the call ended.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The phone call with my best friend chased away my sleepiness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I took out a pack of strawberries from the fridge and ate it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s delicious, but there’s no way I can finish all of these.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Luckily, there’s plenty of space in the fridge since I haven’t been cooking much lately.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking at the remaining packs of strawberries crammed in there, I made up my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, sharing is the only way. It would be better if someone else could enjoy them.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a feeling of reluctance,</p>
<p class="calibre4">I packed several packs into a department store paper bag and left room 103, my own room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’m not in love right now, but maybe I should be a bit more proactive.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While having such resolve, I pressed the intercom of the next room, 102.</p>

<p class="calibre3">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">The voice I heard from the next room woke me up, and I fell off the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ouch… What?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After dinner, I finished the Japanese history worksheet for homework and lay down on the edge of the bed, but it seemed that I had fallen asleep.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Rubbing my backside, I couldn’t help but look at the wall adjoining the next room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know her face or name, but judging from the voice I had just heard, she seemed to be a young woman.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The neighbor must be a working adult or college student.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Their morning is early, and they come home late, so their rhythm of life is different from mine as a high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, I’ve never once met her outside the apartment.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, the walls here are relatively thin, so I can often hear the sound of her alarm clock set loudly in the early morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Plus, it goes off several times, so I’ve naturally become an early riser.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, I’ve never been late once despite living alone as a high school student.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before going back to sleep, I finished preparing for tomorrow and had just finished washing the dishes in the kitchen when the room’s bell rang.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Coming! I’ll be right there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I opened the door without even checking the door peephole.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good evening, I’m sorry for the late hour. I’m Tenjō from room 103 next door, and I’m here to share something with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“───!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, it felt as bright as midday, and my field of vision lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was there a halo shining?</p>
<p class="calibre4">A stunningly beautiful woman stood at my doorway, and I was frozen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman who visited my room who calls herself Tenjō stated her purpose with a clear voice, all the while wearing a pleasant smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The long-haired woman claiming to be my neighbor was beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her age appeared to be in her late teens to early twenties.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She had a small, well-defined face, and despite wearing an oversized parka that covered down to her hips, her arms and legs were long and slender.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My eyes were involuntarily drawn to her thighs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On her feet were fur-trimmed sandals, an odd choice that didn’t quite fit the season.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Despite the casual outfit, she had an overwhelming charm that could not be hidden.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like a doll, her beauty clearly transcended that of an average person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I definitely won’t be surprised if she was a model or an actress.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, are you listening?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Seeing me in a daze, she asked with a concerned look.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah? Um, are you my next-door neighbor?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that’s right. I have some delicious strawberries, do you want them?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She opened a department store paper bag and showed the strawberries inside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The strawberries, packed and glistening, were a juicy red, gleaming like jewels.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“They do look very tasty.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry, it’s not a sales pitch or solicitation. I know you might be surprised, but I received so many strawberries that I can’t finish them all by myself. Do you dislike strawberries?”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Cat/00011.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I like them, so it’s not a problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s great, I can vouch for the taste! They’re sweet and juicy, and once you start eating, you can’t stop! I’d appreciate it if you could accept it. What do you think?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed to be the type whose actions were as spontaneous as her feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she asked, she stepped closer and offered the paper bag to me. And as she moved, her hair swayed, and a pleasant scent wafted towards me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, I’ll accept it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I take it, pretending to be calm so as not to show her that I’m shaken.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please put them in the fridge and try to eat them as soon as possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alrigh──hm?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I continued the conversation nervously, I suddenly realized something.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I recognized this scent coming from her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perfume… no, maybe shampoo.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt like I had smelled it very recently. In fact, I sensed the same scent earlier today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Where was it from?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Curiosity overcame my nervousness, and I took a good look at her face again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, I realized who she was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The person I see almost every day in the classroom at school came to mind, but I immediately dismissed the possibility.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It couldn’t be her in a place like this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thinking this, I blinked several times. But the woman in front of me did not disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To me, she was too beautiful to be considered just someone who looked like a person I know.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t recognize her immediately because she was out of her usual adult-looking image. Dressed in casual clothes and with makeup removed gives her a younger appearance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you here!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Startled, I almost dropped the paper bag. She reacted at the same time, and her slender hand overlapped mine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, we ended up both holding the handles of the bag filled with strawberries.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m so sorry!? It’s because I didn’t grip it properly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry too! I think I put too many strawberries in the bag, and it was too heavy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She hastily drew her hands to her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, an awkward silence ensued.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please don’t worry about it. Anyway, sorry to disturb you this late at night.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She seemed to feel uncomfortable and started to escape back to her own room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, I called out her name.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re Tenjō-sensei, aren’t you!? Reiyu Tenjō.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suddenly hearing her name called, she stopped in her tracks.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What, I thought I only introduced myself by my last name?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice had turned tense at once.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did I mishear you? And it seemed like you were also called me Sensei…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She turned around slowly with stiff movements like a robot that had missed an oiling, staring at me cautiously.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good evening. I’m Yuunagi Nishiki from Sensei’s class…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hurriedly introduced myself by my full name to clear up any misunderstanding.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“yuunaginishiki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She repeated my name in a broken speech.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m the boy currently sitting in front of your desk in class. Sensei, don’t you recognize me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I added a self-introduction with an apologetic tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she leaned in close to my face as if she couldn’t see very well.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, Tenjō-sensei. Aren’t you, like, too close?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was bewildered by her face being close enough that I could almost feel her breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I guess a beautiful woman is still a beautiful woman even if she has removed her makeup.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Being stared at so intently by those large eyes from such a close distance made me hesitate even to breathe.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“───! Yuunagi Nishiki!? What, Nishiki-kun!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sensei, recognizing who I was, staggered back as if jumping away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then one of her sandals came off with that momentum.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, Sensei, your sandal…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Y-you’ve got the wrong person!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ignoring her rolled sandal, Tenjō-sensei fled into her own room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Wherever she is, her radiance never dims.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That dazzling smile that captivated people, her breathtaking beauty, the cheerful aura that uplifted spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no mistaking such a sun-like beauty.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The neighbor who came to share something with me──was my homeroom teacher, Reiyu Tenjō.</p>
