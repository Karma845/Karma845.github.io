<h3>Prologue</h3>


<p>After the end of school, the two of us took a detour to home to cover our traces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was an off-travel railway route, a one-way street flanked by fences and wall tiles.</p>



<p>“It’s hot.”said Hayakasa, who was walking beside me. She was dressed in a refreshing summer school uniform with neatly cut hair, and her shy expression that showed his childish side.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;My throat is dry.”</p>



<p>Saying that she took a sip of the soft drink she just bought at the vending machine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kirishima-kun, do you want a sip?&#8221;</p>



<p>“You don’t mind?”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>Then she happily handed me the can of soda. Although I already had a bottle filled with tea inside my bag, considering the hot weather and blue sky I really wanted to drink a refreshing soft drink.</p>



<p>But was this really okay?</p>



<p>My classmate, Hayasaka-san, had just drunk the soft drink, I couldn’t stop myself from looking at her soft and watery lips which just touched the can of soda.</p>



<p>If I drank it like that, it could well also be labelled an indirect kiss!?</p>



<p>She, however, had an unconcerned expression and a seemingly innocent girl’s smile.</p>



<p>If I hesitate any longer, I will make her realize this instead.</p>



<p>So without caring and thinking much about it I drank the drink with my mouth.</p>



<p>“Indirect Kiss”</p>



<p>She choked me, as soon as those words came from her mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;You dare to play with me ah!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ehehehe&#8221;</p>



<p>Sasaka-san smiled and made a V gesture. But the smile was very reserved, and her face was red.</p>



<p>“Don’t be shy, if you have the ability to go so far to do it.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;“I’m not shy.”</p>



<p>The apparently shy-faced Hayasaka-san, however, directly changed the topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, you seemed to be chatting a lot with your friends today during the lunch break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That guy said he has a crush.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh! Did Kirishima-Kun’s friend ask you for relationship counseling! ?</p>



<p>“You don’t think it’s appropriate either right? I am just an average looking guys with four-eyes[ TL: Here Four-Eyes refers to wearing specs]</p>



<p>“But I really like the way Kirishima-kun looks. Indeed there is a feeling that he is only good at studying, and the persona is instantly established.”</p>



<p>“You are not saying good things for me.”</p>



<p>&#8220;So, so? What kind of advice did you give your friend?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Explain it to him* the &#8220;Looking More Effect&#8221;</p>



<p><em>*Mere Exposure Effect is a psychological phenomenon-people will have a good impression simply because they are familiar with something. In social psychology, this effect is also called the &#8220;familiarity principle&#8221; (English: familiarity principle). This phenomenon covers a wide range of things, such as text, paintings, portrait photos, polygons, and sounds. In the study of interpersonal relationships, the more times a person appears in front of one&#8217;s own eyes, the easier it is for one to have a preference and affection for it.</em></p>



<p><em>{ED: Our TL is a smart kid!}</em></p>



<p>Hayasaka-san, whose eyes were shining, heard me say so, and immediately said &#8220;Ah-um&#8221; and turned her expression into a subtle one.</p>



<p>&#8220;How do I say it. It definitely feels like Kirishima-Kun&#8217;s answer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re definitely not complimenting me, are you?</p>



<p>The &#8220;look-more effect&#8221; is the psychological phenomenon of &#8220;being attracted to things that are familiar to you&#8221;. This psychology can also be used to explain the tendency to want to buy something after seeing an advertisement, or the tendency to like people around you more than those with whom you have little interaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Human beings fall in love with things they know.&nbsp; So I suggest that he first meet the girl he likes every day. Say hello, borrow something from her, etc.,then it should be fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh~ “look more” at effect!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san who nodded slowly showed a naughty expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Then let&#8217;s try it too, this method.&#8221;</p>



<p>“She gently pressed the back of her hand against my hand.”</p>



<p>“Let’s first start by holding hands.”</p>



<p>&#8220;No, the contact mentioned here refers to the perceptual meaning of seeing and hearing.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong><em>[ TL: Look more at the effect.</em></strong><em> The original Japanese text is a pure contact effect, and Hayasaka understands it as a literal contact.]</em></p>



<p>&#8220;But maybe direct contact works better? That&#8217;s definitely true.&#8221;</p>



<p>At some point, the schoolbag that was originally hanging on my one shoulder moved to my other shoulder!.</p>



<p>At such a close distance, I couldn&#8217;t help but get nervous.</p>



<p>——&#8211;Maybe direct contact works better?</p>



<p>She was&nbsp; definitely taking it out of context, but it may be true.</p>



<p>Even if you accidentally touch your shoulders with a girl who has no feelings, you will bump into the deer. If you are hugged by the other person in the haunted house, there is a certain chance that you start developing feelings for the other person.</p>



<p>This is probably the sensibility that rationality or reason cannot suppress.</p>



<p>Physical contact has a special magical effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if I were to hold hands with Hayasaka-san at this time?</p>



<p>Maybe I will like Hayasaka-san more than I Thought, and she will like me more than she thought</p>



<p>&#8220;Kirishima-kun&#8221;.</p>



<p>She was still touching me gently with the back of her hand.</p>



<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wwtCmRy/freda-book-image.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>She kept leaning towards me until my arm seemed to touch her chest.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>



<p>Although Hayasaka has a baby-like face, her body is too mature.</p>



<p>I suddenly felt embarrassed for some reason, so I turned my face away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Holding hands is too logical. It&#8217;s not suitable for verifying psychological phenomena&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bad habit to try to escape by forcing words, Kirishima-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>She then grabbed my hand.</p>



<p>So I hid my hands in my trouser pockets.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, then I&#8217;ll take your arm.&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing her about to put her arm around me, I ran to the side of the road in panic.</p>



<p>I said I would break away from her clutches, but because I pulled away I cursed myself to see a valley wrapped between her white shirt.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh heh, I seem to understand the reason Kirishima-kun is shy.&#8221;</p>



<p>ED/N: Yes he says it like causing harm to himself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If we had more physical contact, maybe our relationship would improve?&#8221;</p>



<p>With a grimace, she chased him aggressively.</p>



<p>We chased each other through the alley.</p>



<p>Although Hayasaka-san looked and acted like a child, she indeed looked like a high school student with her limbs sticking out from her school uniform, and her skin was clean and beautiful, and her panting red face was a little s**y.</p>



<p>Because I was not mentally prepared to make skin-to-skin contact with her, I ran away. Hayasaka-san, who was not very athletic, almost tripped herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, then let me do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>She ran ahead and spreaded her arms in an impassable posture, while I passed under her armpits as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you have some fun, Kirishima-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>She slammed her whole body towards me, and I leaned back with my shoulders, and for a while there was a stalemate.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, it&#8217;s too early for us!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for us to go further.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, wait, wait. Weren&#8217;t we supposed to be still discussing and looking at the effect.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>However, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to be crunchy!? Hayasaka-san is actually…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t had any contact with men either, have you? You&#8217;re actually very shy. Don&#8217;t pretend to be experienced.&#8221;</p>



<p>As if hit by a single word, Hayasaka-san&#8217;s eyes began to drift away.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What are y-yo-you talking about, Kirishima-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You still do this kind of thing even when you&#8217;re this shy&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your fault!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said furiously, probably realizing it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you keep refusing to hold my hand!&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought I was being unforgiving, and she was really thinking about that?</p>



<p>This creature is really too cute. I want to think so, I still put my shoulders against Hayasaka-san who was pushing hard into me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do? Look how red your face is!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t try my best. It&#8217;s just because the weather is too hot!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so!&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m still ashamed here.</p>




<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>The following day in the classroom, I observed the movements of Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>As soon as she got to school, she spread out her textbook and previewed what was to be taught. She took notes in her book while also responding to those who greeted her.</p>



<p>Although she was already a very kind person, today she was extraordinarily spirited.</p>



<p>I think she was pushing herself too hard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Hayasaka!&#8221;</p>



<p>A boy from the next class who looked a bit frivolous walked into our classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tonight, we borrowed a studio band to practice playing, don&#8217;t you want to hear it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry &#8230;&#8230; not tonight. My family doesn&#8217;t allow it&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really. Then, We&#8217;ll talk about it another time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not going to work,&#8221; the boy who said that to himself left again in disgust.</p>



<p>The boys in the class who saw this scene also began to discuss.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hayasaka-san is still the same, she&#8217;s as cold as ever.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get it, do you? That&#8217;s the best thing. She&#8217;s so innocent and pitiful, she feels like she&#8217;s growing up under the care of someone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;According to my personal investigation, there are rumors that the only male in her phone contacts is her father.&#8221;</p>



<p>The above conversation was going on right behind my seat, but I didn&#8217;t join in, nor was I asked to comment on Hayasaka-san.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;A girl who is so reserved must be very difficult to get involved with.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get it, do you? You don&#8217;t understand that, do you? You&#8217;re the type of girl who would be shy to hold hands, like Hayasaka. You really don&#8217;t know anything about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;According to my sources, Hayasaka-san has been confessed to many times but has not dated anyone. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s a late bloomer in this area.&#8221;</p>



<p>The sound of their discussion was so loud that Hayasaka-san hid behind her textbook in shame.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, boys over there, stop your strange delusions about Akane-san.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who can stand this?&#8221;</p>



<p>When the bell rang, everyone went back to their seats. The boys looked at Hayasaka reluctantly, while the girls blustered at the boys to protect her.</p>



<p>In the midst of all this hustle and bustle, I caught a glimpse of Hayasaka-san. The next thing I knew, she was covering her face with her textbook. Then she secretly put the textbook down again and observed my face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you keep staring, everyone will find out,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>The expression she put on her face seemed to say so.</p>



<p>Her cheeks were flushed.</p>



<p>Although I wanted to say something, I turned my eyes back to the blackboard and prepared for class.</p>



<p>My relationship with her was a secret from everyone.</p>



<p>Even when it came to lunch break, this would not change.</p>



<p>I ate my bento alone, while Hayasaka-san was called by the guy in the next seat. It was about the survey of hopes for higher education that the teacher had mentioned earlier.</p>



<p>&#8220;What would you like to choose Hayasaka?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liberal arts or science?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good match for the literature department. A studious girl who sits on a bench in the school and reads many books!&#8221;</p>



<p>The other students in the class also joined the conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;English is not bad, right? You could be a translator or a stewardess if you speak English fluently?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It should be home economics!&#8221;</p>



<p>After a heated discussion, Hayasaka said politely.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Is science&#8221;</p>



<p>In a flash, everyone was dumbfounded. It didn&#8217;t fit her image.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahhh, I get it!&#8221;</p>



<p>The person who is good at reading the atmosphere spoke up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Miss Nurse! The angel in white clothes is also a good match for Hayasaka-san. I really want to be taken care of by you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The topic was finally put to rest.</p>



<p>And she smiled at me helplessly.</p>



<p>This is completely labeled but I can&#8217;t help but think so.</p>



<p>Serious, innocent, cute, and with that, she was idolized.</p>



<p>Indeed, that was the impression she gave.</p>



<p>She takes notes in class, lends notes to students who forget to listen to the scope of the exam during class, and helps the teacher carry materials even if she&#8217;s not on duty. In physical education class, even if she was not very good at sports, she would endure with her bumped foot and practice hurdles many times.</p>



<p>Even the direction of further education was chosen as a veterinary subject with the reason of petting small animals, so the image is really similar.</p>



<p>All people like this kind of Hayasaka-san.</p>



<p>But this love, in my opinion, is sometimes the same as treating a cute doll.</p>



<p>They only have these labels in their eyes, but ignore Hayasaka-san herself.</p>



<p>So no one noticed that she was different from her usual self today.</p>



<p>With concern, I stood up and walked to Hayasaka-san&#8217;s seat when no one was looking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Since we hadn&#8217;t spoken in the classroom, her voice started to panic.</p>



<p>I, on the other hand, pretended to pass by accidently by chance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hayasaka-san, why do you look so red?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when everyone finally noticed the fact that she wasn&#8217;t feeling well today.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s too good at showing off. I told her yesterday, didn&#8217;t I?</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you really not, really feverish?&#8221;</p>





<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>




<p>Before the start of the fifth class, I left the classroom.</p>



<p>At that moment, I saw Hayasaka, who was leaving early and was about to go home by the window.</p>



<p>I walked out of the school gate and took a few steps to catch up with the stumbling Hayasaka.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kirishima-kun, what are you doing here?</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you home and will carry your bag for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry for causing you trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all because you tried too hard.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yeah. But I always try to be a good girl in front of everyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not the case, said Hayasaka.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bad girl, much more than anyone would have thought.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I saw that she was about to faint, I held her hand without thinking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kirishima-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>The eyes of Hayasaka-san widened when she looked at the hands she was holding.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; How can I say this? It&#8217;s just that I want to try to see the effect of more.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well. So, did it work?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just that my body is a little hot. I feel like I&#8217;m getting hot too. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I seem to like it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hayasaka-san held my hand and leaned against me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s working.&#8221;</p>



<p>The weight of this leaning and the heat coming from it.</p>



<p>I could feel Hayasaka-san&#8217;s presence on my side. It&#8217;s not the kind of impression or label.</p>



<p>&#8220;If other people knew that I was doing this, they would be shocked. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a scandal.&#8221;</p>



<p>She now puts on a cute expression that she could never show in the classroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually, I&#8217;ve wanted to post with Kirishima-kun before&#8221; [TL: EDITOR HELP IN THIS LINE PLEASE]</p>



<p>She said, rubbing against me happily with a blushing face. As if enjoying the touch with me, the strength of her grip on my hand was sometimes strong and sometimes weak.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fortunately, I&#8217;ve been getting hot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I can be treated kindly by Kirishima-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>She pressed her entire face and body close to me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;You did it on purpose, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When I recover, I will do more and more dangerous things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I said.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I am not a good girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>I helped Hayasaka-san, who had a fever, to take her home. Although she looked very uncomfortable, she smiled contentedly.</p>



<p>To an outsider, it seemed like a cute girl and a passerby-looking guy were dating, I guess. Indeed we have said that we are a couple hence, it&#8217;s not wrong to look at it that way.</p>



<p>However, we have hidden secrets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have another person I like, and Hayasaka-san is my backup option.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m her backup, too, since Hayasaka-san also has someone else she likes. In other words-</p>



<p>Neither of us has each other in our lives, but we are dating as backups.</p>
