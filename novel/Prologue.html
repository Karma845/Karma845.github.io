<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito
... You're banned from the party."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"……eh?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't understand what's going on. I was surprised and leaked out my voice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">We
are currently exploring the world's largest , hardest and most punitive dungeon,
'Naraku'(hell).</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">My
role in the party is a baggage carrier and miscellaneous worker.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
we were taking a break before entering the dungeon's middle level, I was told
that I would be banned.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As I
put down the backpack on the ground, the sweat I wiped off turned to cold sweat.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Drago-san
is the leader of the Legion "Race Union" party. He is a bipedal
dragon race who is strong, smart, kind, and reliable.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
seems that without realizing it, I have annoyed Drago-san or the other party
members and made them angry.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So I
hurriedly bow down and ask for them to forgive me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
shout, asking for forgiveness with a pale face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Sorry
I'm sorry! If you have any problems, I'll fix them right away, so please don't
ban me from the party!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Huf,
hehehe... we've decided to ban you because we don't need you anymore. Don't you
understand that?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
hate inferior humans because they're really stupid."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou-san
the beast race, and Sasha-san the elf, the rest of the party looked disgusted
and looked down at me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I am
more surprised by what both had said than Drago-san's ban statement.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There
are six races in this world: human race, beast race, dragon race, elf race,
dwarf race, and demon race.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
human race is less powerful than the beast race, and unlike the dragon race and
the elf race, they don't have a long lifespan nor good at magic.</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">
</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They are not as skillful as the Dwarves
and not as smart as the demon race.</span></span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The human
race is looked down and discriminated against in this world as the 'most
inferior'.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
the Race Union is famous for its members who disliked such discrimination. They
gathered their members based on the noble idea of creating a world where all
species are equal in the future.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou-san,
who looked like a wolf walking on two legs, also yelled and got angry when I
was mocked by the beastmen in the city.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Sasha,
an elf with beautiful blond hair that reached all the way down to her back and
pointed ears, had comforted me when I was discriminated against and crying.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
two of them looked at me as if I had changed, as if they're looking at ugly
insects, as if they're looking down on pitiful prey, and spat at me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
could not help but be shocked by the sudden change, as if I had been hit in the
head with a blunt object.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Oh,
why the hell are you--"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
remaining two members gave their opinions faster than my question.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hey,
how long are you going to messing around? We don't need him anymore, right?
Then kill him quickly. If another party comes and sees this, we'll be in
trouble.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
agree with Nano. It's painful for me to even breathe the same air as human, but
I can't take it any longer."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nano,
a dwarf with a bushy beard, urged to kill me. He talked as if he wants to throw
away a tool he no longer needed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
carefully taught me how to polish my sword and repair and maintain my armor at
the Legion mansion.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Diablo
is<span> a young demon race with horns, wearing a pale and tall
suit.</span> He often taught me table manners. He is usually sarcastic, but
I've never heard him say anything with such obvious murderous intent as he did
just now.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
turned my attention back to Drago-san, the party leader.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
realized that my own teeth are gritting in fear, I ask Drago-san.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"You're
kidding, right? You guys are acting to make fun of me, right? Be, because there
is no reason to kill me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
there is."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Drago-san
immediately declares.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Just
in case, let's kill him."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Just,
just in case. ...... Just in case, you'll kill me?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Oh,
I don't understand what you mean......."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito,
you have a rare gift that other humans didn't have, don't you?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ye,
yes. It's called 'Infinite Gacha'. But don't you already know that it's a
useless gift that only produces trash."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
one reaches the age of 10 in this world, some people will be granted an
extremely rare gift.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
was lucky enough to get one, but it was an 'Infinite Gacha', something I didn't
understand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">To
use 'Infinite Gacha', simply open the Gacha button and press it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
you press the button, you get a card.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
object drawn on the card can be materialized in the real world.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
sounds very useful, but in these two years, until I turned 12, I have only got
garbage such as "bread (with mold)," "socks (one side),"
and "spoons (broken).</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
a completely useless gift.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Initially,
the top management suspected that Raito is a 'Master' who got the unique
benefit of 'Infinite Gacha'. We were taking you in and closely observing your
gift, personality, speech, and behavior. But...... your gift produces nothing
but garbage, and your status is just human level. I'm sure that you're not a 'Master',
just in case we'll kill you. Put out the fire while it's still small, otherwise
it could be disastrous." </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't even understand half of the story!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
apparently, I'm not a 'Master' and just to be safe, they're going to kill me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">What
the hell is a 'Master'?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"The
government was disappointed that he wasn't a Master, but I was grateful. If Raito
is a Master, I would have had to marry a human to take in his blood. Just
thinking about it gives me goosebumps!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hahahaha!
I'm sure the Elf Nation will be disappointed. Because I've heard that masters love
the elf for some reason!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Na,
nation?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Oh,
so the "upper management" that Drago-san was talking about is the
nation?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Is 'Master'
the kind of person who would be targeted by the government?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">What
the hell did that 'Master' do?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Drago-san
glared at Garou-san and Sasha-san.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
expected, the two shrank a bit after being glared by Drago-san, who is indeed
the highest level among them. They shook their shoulders and made a serious
face.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nano-san
and Diablo-san turn their eyes to the two.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"*<i class="calibre7">Yareyare</i>, elf and beastman shouldn't be
so talkative."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"We
are superior to humans, so I guess that's more of a charm than a flaw..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Drago-san
is ignoring their words and rebuke the two of them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Don't
say unnecessary things. How will you take responsibility if the information is
leaked?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
sorry, leader. My, my mouth slipped..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Sorry,
I'm sorry I got carried away. We'll get rid of this kid so that information
won't leak.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yeah!
Garou says good things! We'll take responsibility!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hii!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou-san
has his steel claws equipped, and Sasha-san takes out her bow and starts
drawing the string.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They're
really trying to kill me!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
scream escapes my lips.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
stepped back then turned away to run from them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gyahahaha!
This place is 'Naraku'! Even if you lowly human can escape from us, there's no
way you can survive a demon beast attack!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
not going to let you go, though!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
talking, Sasha shoots an arrow.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gyaaah!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
arrow went straight through my left leg.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
screamed because of the intense pain, and rolled to the ground, unable to run
anymore.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I am
bleeding in many places because I had fallen so hard on the rugged cave, but
the arrow in my left foot hurt more than anything else.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ah,
that's good, that look, that screams! After all, Hunting game with humans as
prey is still pleasant. I can't understand the language if it's a monster or
just an animal, so the fun is halved."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Don't
give him a chance. Kill him quickly! The story was supposed to be 'we were exploring
Naraku, world's hardest and dangerous dungeon. Unfortunately, one of my friends
was attacked by a monster and died. But if another party sees this, they won't
believe our story!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yeah,
I know. Actually, I wanted to ridicule and kill you. Still, since you had danced
and entertained us without knowing our purpose, so I won't make you suffer any
longer and kill you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Mr.
Garou approaches me defenselessly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
wants to kill me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"
My face are full of tears and drools, blood flowing from the wound in my leg. I
keep denying reality in front of me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
a lie, it's a lie, and it's a lie!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
people at the Race Union are good people. ...... You're imposters! You are
definitely imposters!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"><span></span>Drago-san's imposter yells at me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Nonsense.
A proud dragon race would never seriously associate with humans on equal terms.
We only reluctantly did what the upper management instructed."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou-san's
impostor laughs happily.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gyahahahahaha!
Damn, it's the most entertaining thing I've ever done! It's amusing!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Sasha-san's
impostor frowns unpleasantly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"What
do you mean by respecting us? Human's despair face is ugly and unpleasant! I
wonder why my nation doesn't destroy these humans quickly."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nano-san's
impostor looks troubled and urges them to hurry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't care, just kill him quickly. Since he's not 'Master', I don't care about him.
It's a waste of time."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Diablo-san's
imposter shrugs and agrees.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Just
like Nano said, it's a waste of time. Above all, human despair face is ugly.
It's most rational for us to kill him quickly and leave the dungeon."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
imposters speak, look, and sound like the real ones. They're cursing, mocking,
yelling, and going to kill me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't want to be killed. I desperately run away.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">My
legs hurt, and I can't run, so I crawl on the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Because
this place is a cave, the ground is rugged stones</span></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">,
and just crawling causes the skin all over my body to tear and bleed, but I
ignore it and keep moving.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't want to die without knowing why.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
in the corner of my head, I understand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'll
never make it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I'm
level 15.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I am
12 years old this year, but the level is high for my age.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
reason is that they helped raise the level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So,
how high is everyone else's level?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Drago
level is around 500.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou
is around level 150.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Sasha
is around level 300.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nano
is around level 300.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Diablo
is around level 400.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
human race is inferior to other species in strength, magic and longevity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Therefore,
they are the lowest, and other species can easily raise their level by
utilizing their strength, magic power and life span. This is a factor that
increases racial discrimination.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
overwhelming difference in level, species, and the number of people make it
absolutely impossible to escape from them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Still,
I didn't want to die, so I crawled along the ground.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">--that
struggle brings me bad luck.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">My
right-hand reaches out to crawl and touches the trap.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Instantly,
the ground begins to glow.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?
He touched the transfer trap!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Don't
let him get away! Kill hi---"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Everyone's
voices cut off at that point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">My vision
was cut off there for a moment.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
whole body hurts......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
was lucky enough to escape from the members of the Legion (Race Union).</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
an arrow pierced my left leg, and I crawled on the cave ground, causing my skin
to tear and bleed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
the relief of escaping safely, the pain immediately attacked me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
lay on my back and looked up at the ceiling.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
managed to get out of there safely, but it looks like I'm still in a cave-type
dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
not like the cave at the entrance to the middle part of 'Naraku'. The ground
where I lay is a darker rocky ground.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Dad,
mom, brother, Yume... After all, the city was a scary place. I want to go back
to the countryside..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Pain
all over my body, arrow wounds, the friends I trusted cursing me and almost
killing me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
sadness made me nostalgic.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Originally
I am the second son of a poor farmer. My older brother left home to follow in
our father's footsteps.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">My
parents and older brothers kept saying, "Raito, you don't need to leave
home.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But if
I left home, my life would be more comfortable, and I could feed my sister Yume
more.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is the result of my greed to make a name for myself in the city.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There's
no way I'm going to let my family see me now.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Above
all, if I don't escape from this world's largest, hardest and dangerous dungeon
'Naraku', I will never see my family or even see the sun again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
Why did they try to trick and kill a country bumpkin like me? What's a 'Master'?
Why the nation bother to give such instructions? I don't want to die without
knowing anything about it. Above all,......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Respect,
betrayal, despair, and sadness are all turned upside down.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'll
never forgive them for betraying me!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
will kill them!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I'm not going to die like this without
taking revenge! I can't die if I don't take my revenge on those who betrayed
me!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
flame of revenge burns in my heart.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
flame of revenge overcomes the pain in my body.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"To
survive and take revenge on them, and to reunite with my family, I must stop
the bleeding and get out of here--huh!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
my bad luck continues.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gurururururu!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
monster appeared, probably because it was too noisy or because they can smell
the blood.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
large, four-legged beast roughly 10m high. Its tail looks like a snake and
bigger than my body. It sticks its tail towards me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
four-legged beast grabbed me firmly and drooled over me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
it was just a beast, it would have just attacked me, and that would have been
the end of it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"What
!? Im, impossible ... Level 1000 !?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
status screen can be optionally displayed to a third party.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
four-legged beast displays the status screen as if it's trying to mess my mind.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Show
me the difference between us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
was wrong.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
had mistakenly thought that when the transfer trap was activated, I had been
transported to somewhere near the entrance of the middle part of 'Naraku' where
I first entered the level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
the truth is that I am in the deepest part of 'Naraku', a place that no one has
ever reached.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Otherwise,
there's no way a mythical beast with level 1000 can stand in front of me!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I,
I have to run away! I have to run away-- whe, where?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If I
am in the deepest part of 'Naraku', there is no way for a level 15 human to
escape.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is impossible to escape from the monster in front of me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gurururururu!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
monster laughs.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
if it understands my despair, the beast laughing happily and slowly walks up to
me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If I
get too close to it, I'll be eaten alive, but I'd rather die before that happen.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
I can't die yet.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't want to die without knowing the truth, without seeing my family again,
without getting revenge on those who deceived and betrayed me! I'm not going to
die like a piece of trash!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
since I left my backpack behind, I don't have a knife, a water bottle, or even
a flint.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
only thing I have is the gift.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
pray desperately and hit the 'Infinite Gacha', the gift given to me by God.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
have no choice but to put my trust in the 'Infinite Gacha' to get me through
this horrible situation!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Guru!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
big, divine magic circle formed around me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
light was so bright and mysterious that even the level 1,000 monster that had
been approaching me with a relaxed attitude stunned. </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gurugaaaaaaaaaa!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That
light covered my whole body and the entire deepest part of 'Naraku'.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/TvxpryN/000012.jpg" height="500" width="330"></img>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"---I
won't forgive anybody who dares to turn his fang at my master, not even a
puppy."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Black
hair dancing in the light.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
head of that 1000 level monster was instantly chopped off. His limbs were
sliced by sharp blades that made one wonder if it had been torn apart from the
beginning.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
voice owner was not showered by the monster's blood. She's standing between the
beast and me as if she had been there from the beginning.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
long black hair looked as if it had been cut from the night darkness and tied
with a long ribbon into a ponytail.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is wearing a maid's uniform, like those often worn by servants of noble
families. Her gloves are pure white, and even her shoes are clean. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is tall for a woman, and her face has big eyes, long eyelashes, red rosy lips,
and a lovely shaped nose. Everything is perfectly arranged, and her skin is so
smooth and white that she looked like a doll created by God.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
beauty alone is eye-catching, but her breasts, which are pushed up from
underneath by her maid's uniform, are extremely large. Any man would be tempted
to look at them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
waist is so thin that it looks like it might break, and her arms and legs are
long and slender, so she has a very good figure.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
eyes turn to me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
eyes look sad, and she sits on one knee on the spot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
as if she's a knight serving a king.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
could not bear to see my lord's beautiful face and pearly skin get hurt any
longer, so I presumptuously healed you. I apologize for my selfish
behavior."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"?
Eh? Ah! It really doesn't hurt!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
raised my upper body to check my wound.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
arrow in my leg had somehow slipped out, and there is no pain, not even a
scratch.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
Lord, can you tell me your name with that beautiful voice?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"What,
my name? My name is Raito."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito-sama,
Raito-sama, Raito-sama--what a wonderful and noble name."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
she repeatedly repeats my name in her mouth, she clasps her hands in front of
her chest and prays.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
maid way is to live for my lord, to serve my lord, and to die for my lord. I
swear by my maid way, and I ask you to accept my absolute loyalty to my
lord."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you, my lord. In the sky, I'll be the bird that spread its wing. On the earth,
I'll be the tree that extends its branches forever. Even in death, I'll be your
support."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
"yes" I just said was not affirmative. It was a question...but now
it's too late to correct it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">First
of all, who is she?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Why
is she in the deepest part of the 'Naraku'?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">What
was the magic circle earlier?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
did she heal my wounds?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
blood of the beast was splattered all over the place. Shouldn't I leave this
place before the smell draws others?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Many
things are going through my mind, I'm confused, and I don't know what to say.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Perhaps
she's sensing my confusion, the maid began to introduce herself.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
apologize for the delay in greeting you. My name is SUR card 'Mei the Seeker
Maid' level 9999.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ugh,
an Ultra rare card?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Le, level 9999?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes.
It's a SUR card from Raito-sama's gift 'Infinite Gacha'. As long as I'm by your
side, I promise I won't let any monsters in this dungeon touch Raito-sama's beautiful
skin."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
fact, she had just killed a level 1000 mythical monster in an instant.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
long as she is around, my safety would be guaranteed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
I still couldn't believe it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"It's
impossible. My gift 'Infinite Gacha' is a waste that only produces trash item
cards. There is no way that someone as amazing as Mei-san will come out of it.
First of all, how can a person come out of a Gacha card?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"My
lord, I'm a maid. I don't need a title. Please call me Mei."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
but ......"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Please."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
couldn't resist her strong voice and sad eyes, so I obeyed obediently.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Me,
Mei......."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you for granting your servant's wish. As expected, Raito-sama's kindness is
huge. 'Infinite Gacha' is a royal instrument. It's Raito-sama gift, so it can't
be a waste. Excuse me, can I use my 'Appraisal' to check it ??"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ap,
appraisal !? Mei-san ... Mei has the 'appraisal' gift!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
benefit "Appraisal" allows one to appraise people and objects
according to their level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is one of the most popular gift among the races, and those who have obtained it
will have no trouble finding work for the rest of their lives.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"To
be exact, it is one of my unique skills. May I appraise it?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes,
yes, please."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Then,
please excuse me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Appraisal:
Uh, it's so hidden that you can't know the details without a level like me...
As expected, Raito-sama, I can't imagine how powerful it is.</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">
T</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">he 'Infinite Gacha' gift is</span></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"> a
gacha with an infinite number of uses. The probability of the card being
ejected changes depending on the concentration of magic power. From highest to
the lowest, the ranks are EX, SUR, UR, SSSR, SSR, SR, R, N, E."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"?What
does that mean?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As the
second son of a poor farmer, I couldn't quite grasp the explanation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Mei
explained further.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"The
magical power used by magicians when exercising magic is floating in the air.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">'Infinite
Gacha' seems to absorb the magical power and eject the card. Therefore, the
probability of a SUR card like me to come out is close to 0 because magic power
concentration and density are low above the ground. At the bottom of a dungeon
with such a thick magical power, that probability jumps up. "</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"……,
I see."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
did explained to with me, but I still didn't understand half of what she said.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Anyway,
it seems that in places like the lowest level of 'Naraku', I can get awesome
cards like Mei.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
I'm impressed, Raito-sama. Even though you didn't know the details of the 'Infinite
Gacha' from the appraisal, you noticed its characteristics. You went down to
the lowest level of the dungeon alone to get me. You are a worthy person for
dedicating my maid way. However, isn't it a bit reckless for you to go down to
the bottom of the dungeon by yourself? From now on, I will always be by your
side. I can assure you that you will never again suffer such injuries in the
name of my maid way."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"............"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito-sama,
what's wrong?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
Mei-sa--- Mei."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
didn't come here because I wanted to come to the bottom of 'Naraku' alone.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
told Mei, who has misunderstood why I was alone in the bottom layer of the world's
largest, world's hardest and dangerous dungeon 'Naraku'.</span></span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">On
the way, I couldn't hold back my tears as I remembered how I had been betrayed
so badly by the people I had trusted.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I finished telling her everything, Mei hugs me tightly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There's
a height difference between her and me. I end up burying my face in Mei's big
breasts.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
had been so sad just now. But I hadn't expected to be hugged by a beautiful
woman like Mei. She buries my face in her breasts, so my whole body, not to
mention my face, turned red.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
smell of happiness, denser than flowers and making my head tingle, tickled my
nose.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
didn't notice my flushed face and patted my head repeatedly to comfort me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"A
maid like me can't imagine Raito-sama's pain, regret, and anger. However, I can
bring down the death penalty on those who are no better than an animal's shit.
Please order me to do so. With my maid's way, I'll bring the heads of those eight
to you in one hour!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Wa,
wait, Mei!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">You can't do that!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
know you're kind, Raito-sama, but I don't think there's any need to show any
mercy to them."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
move away from Mei's chest and shake my head.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No.<span> </span>I'm not trying to show mercy to them. It's
just that I want to become stronger and look back at them. And I want to know
the truth about why the government is looking for, capturing, or trying to kill
'Master'. ...... Do you disagree with me and think that I can't do it?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
my lord's desire is my desire, and if you wish to avenge yourself. With my maid
way at stake, I'll support you. Above all, I believe that Raito-sama will have
no trouble taking revenge and obtaining the truth."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you, Mei.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't deserve your praise."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Just
a few moments ago, I was betrayed by friends who I trusted.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
instead, I met Mei, who was born from my gift, 'Infinite Gacha'. She has
promised to be loyal to me for the rest of my life.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
fact that they betrayed me made me so angry that my guts churned.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
fact that they betrayed me made me so angry that my guts boiled, and I felt so
sad that I wanted to die. But as a result of being dropped into the lowest
level of Naraku, I realized that I was truly happy to have met Mei.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
takes out a handkerchief, wipes away my tears, and tells me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"
If that's the case, Raito-sama, I'm ashamed to say I can't do it all by myself.
Please increase the number of friends like me with the 'Infinite Gacha' gift."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Eh?
But Mei is very strong, isn't it? Because your level is 9999 ... But do you
need other friends? "</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes.
I'm sure I can't crush one or two countries by myself. If it's just revenge,
that's fine.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
if you want to uncover the truth, it is highly likely that I alone won't be
enough to get the truth that Raito-sama wants."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"...
In other words, I should just use the 'Infinite Gacha' to get companions like
Mei, right?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
words were still difficult to understand, and I couldn't understand half of
them. Still, I nodded my head because I understood her idea of increasing the
number of friends with 'Infinite Gacha'.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Mei
listened to my words and smiled like a blossom flower.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Yes,
that's right. Let's increase the number of friends with" Infinite Gacha
"and create Raito-sama's kingdom in this dungeon first."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
understand the meaning of "Let's create Raito-sama's kingdom", but I
pretended not to notice it because I couldn't really understand it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
follow Mei's words and press the 'Infinite Gacha' button again at the bottom of
the world's largest, strongest and worst dungeon, 'Naraku'.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A corner of the deepest part of </span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">the world's largest , hardest and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"(hell).</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Originally,
it was a rugged black rock, but as a result of renovations, it has become a
corridor with a smooth, marble-like texture.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
walls are lined with magical lighting devices, making them brighter.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
I, Raito, walked along, the low-ranking fairy maids who noticed my appearance
lined up by the wall and bowed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
were all beautiful girls with various heights and styles. Even if only one of
them appears on the surface world, many people would be making a fuss about
wanting to make her their wife, their lover, or their daughter-in-law.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thanks
for your hard work."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you, Master."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
responded happily when I called out to them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
raise my hand lightly to them and walk past.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
distance between us has widened considerably, but because the hallway is made
of stone and my skill level has been increased, I still can hear their chatter.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito-sama,
it's my lucky day to be able to talk with him!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Maybe
we've used up all our luck today."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Oh,
Raito-sama is so cool. ...... I want to lick his toes. No, even if it's just
his fallen hair, I'll lick it."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"You
are a pervert!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"But
if you got a chance, you would lick it too, right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Why
wouldn't I?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
like licking, but I also want to be petted."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
want him to look at me with scornful eyes and treat me like a pig."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"OK,
your level is too high!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
couldn't help but let out a chuckle.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
maid who accompany me today looks angry, the vein on her face appears.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Master,
please allow me to stop the chattering fairies right now."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"That's
fine, I don't mind. It just means they love me that much."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"........I
apologize for my overreaction."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
my forgiveness, the vein on her face disappears as if they were never been there
in the first place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As I
proceed further, the beautifully crafted corridor ended, and I came to a rugged
area that looked like the original dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
place is a training ground that had been left untouched.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
people I was looking for were gathered at the training ground.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There
are 3 people in that place. A short, silver-haired vampire thrusts her hands to
the sky and shouts.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
told you I'm not stupid! I can even recite the multiplication as proof. See, 1
x 1 is 1, 1 x 2 is 2, 1 x 3 are 4..."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"
There's no way you can do that. And you're so unbelievably stupid that you
already made a mistake at the beginning."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Nya~."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
long blonde girl in the sorcerer's hat shrugs her shoulders as if she has given
up on the short, silver-haired vampire girl.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
girl in the cat hoodie, who is shorter than the other two, imitates the cat's
voice.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">""<span class="calibre9">*<i class="calibre7">Three women make a
market</i></span>". It's good to be happy and lively. It's much better
than being in the dark and despair."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
left my maid waiting for me there and walked over to the three girls.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"So,
you're all here?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I called out to them, the three of them who had been talking loudly turned
around with sparkling expressions.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Raito-sama!
You've come to see me! I'm so happy!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
short, silver-haired vampire girl, she is also a former card that I drew from
my "Infinite Gacha".</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Pure
Vampire Knight Nazuna, Level 9999".</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
has blood-red eyes and long silver hair, and despite her short stature, her
breasts are very large. She looks like a beautiful young lady, but she is a
lovely girl with a lot of energy, as you can see from her words and actions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is also a powerful knight, wearing heavy armor and holding a huge sword bigger
than her, and she will face any monster that comes her way. </span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"There's
no way God Raito would come to see a child like Nazuna who doesn't have any
single piece of elegancy. God Raito, Elly is always ready to conceive Raito-sama's
divine child. Come on, let's go to Elly's bedroom. If po-po-possible give me
some time to take a bath since I've been sweating a bit."</span></p>





<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
woman with long blond hair and wearing a witch's hat invited me to her room. Her
face turns red, and her eyes clouded with tears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is also a former card that came out from my "Infinite Gacha" gift.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Elly,
the Forbidden Witch, level 9999.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is a witch who has mastered all kinds of magic, sorcery, forbidden arts, and
spirit arts.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
wears a witch's hat and has beautiful blond hair tied in two. Her height is
around 160cm, and she always wears a hat, which makes her look taller.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
style is nice, her breasts are firm, her waist is curvy, and her hips are
well-defined.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Of
course, she is a beautiful young lady with a well-developed face and looks more
like a magical girl than a witch.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
often invites me to her bedroom, but she has no experience and still a virgin. I'm
flattered, but I haven't achieved my goal, so I don't want to have children yet.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
why I have always refused.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Elly
is a beautiful girl and has a good style, so I am very happy about her
feelings.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Nnya
~."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Another
girl ended up purring like a cat and rubbing her head against my body easily.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Of
course, she's also a former card from my "Infinite Gacha" gift.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Genius
Monster Tamer Aoyuki, level 9999.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She's
a monster tamer who can control on any kind of magical beast, divine beast,
phantom beast, or rare beast.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is the shortest of the three and wears a hoodie with cat ears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
chest is small, and her arms and legs are long but slender.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
has a young face, and with her fantastic blue hair color, she is an extremely beautiful
young lady.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
often imitates a cat's purr and rubs her head and body against mine like this.
She's so cute that I can't help but pet her under the chin as if she is a real
cat.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Aoyuki
also looked happy and let out a "meow~♪" sound.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Not
only Nazuna, I have a business with you two as well. Elly, please invite me to
your bedroom again another time. Aoyuki too, listen closely..."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
monster sneaks out from the darkness at the back of the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It is
a huge four-legged beast, almost 10 meters in height, with a snake as its tail
bigger than my body.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
had noticed the monster's presence, but the trauma from the past made my body
stiffen.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
three who noticed me stiffening up quickly take position, ready to attack the
four-legged monster [ the Snake Hellhound].</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"How
dare you disrespect Raito-sama in front of me? ......Don't think I'll let you
die easily."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
hold her large sword lightly as she glared at the monster.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
let you live out of mercy and value, but I can't forgive your sins, making a
move on God Raito. This species should be exterminated from the dungeons, the surface
and erased from all literature and records. Elly opened the magic book on her
hand and unleashed a killing intent."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"--That's
right. For making the King feels uncomfortable, that's more than enough reason
for your hellish existence to perish."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Aoyuki,
who usually only talks like a cat, even said, "the monster should be
eliminated immediately."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Hiding
her gaze with the edge of her hood, wrapping a chain around her hand and hit
the ground to get ready for battle.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
level 1000 snake hellhound was intimidated by 3 people with level 9999, and his
face looks frightened.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If I
were to play a joke here and say, "I permit", the snake hellhounds in
this dungeon and any other places would be extinct.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
cleared my throat and then called out to the three of them.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
fine now. All three of you, please stop. He's scared. <span>See,
he's surprisingly cute once we get used to it."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
approached the snake hellhound and pet it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
snake hellhound also wants to survive, so it rolls on the ground and shows its
belly to be petted.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
snake on its tail also shrugs flirtatiously and stretches, letting its cold
scales touch my cheek.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"If
Raito-sama said so."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"God
Raito's word takes precedence over everything."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Nyaa"</span></p>





<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">All
three of them agreed with my instructions and lowered down their weapon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
a bit of a diversion, I finally get into the main topic.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
just got a call from Mei. She said, "I caught the prey". That's why I
came to ask you all to get ready."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
only reason I didn't use the "call" is that I am so happy that I
wanted to tell them in person, so I went out of my way to find them.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Wooo!
Finally!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Congratulations, Raito-sama! I'll do my
best to get ready!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
don't like the idea of Mei being in charge of catching the prey. This Elly also
can accomplish the mission perfectly. No, I can even do it more than
perfect."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Nya."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Thank
you, Elly. But Elly doesn't look like a human race... On the other hand, Mei

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Elly
has pointed ears, though not as pointed as the elves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
hard to disguise herself as a human.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">On
the other hand, Mei only looked like a beautiful human maid.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If Elly
wanted to, she could fool people with magic tools, but there's no guarantee
it'll always work, so we had to be careful.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
know, I know. But not only Mei, don't forget that God Raito also has Elly."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Of
course. Not just Elly, I am counting on all of you."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">！！！！</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
three of them were so touched by my words. Their cheeks are blushing, and their
bodies are trembling.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
nice to see that their very high loyalty, but sometimes they are overreacting,
that I couldn't help but let out a slight chuckle.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
time has come.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I had
been waiting for almost three years. I couldn't help but smiling happily
because I finally can accomplish one of my revenge.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou
the beast arrogantly walks down the central street of the city.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">People
on the street immediately clear the way for him, and those who adore him come
to bow to him.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hello,
Garou <i class="calibre7">aniki</i>!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Where
are you going? If you don't mind, let me accompany you."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hey,
Garou, I was wondering if you'd like to meet my sister. My sister is a fan of
you."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
no. Rather than meet his mysterious sister, it will better for you to meet my
daughter."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Garou-sama,
please come back to the store and tell us your heroic story. We'll be
waiting!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Garou-sama,
please come to our store instead of those little girls' store! If you come here,
I promise you'll get special treatment."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
young beastmen, the young men, the old men, the young women, and the attractive
female beastmen took turns calling out to him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou
doesn't stop but lightly raises his hand to decline while his tail wags in a
good mood.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
sorry, but I still have work to do. I don't have any time right now. When I'm
free, I'll call you or come visit you, so just wait for me."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Those
who were turned down by Garou said nothing more. They looked at him with
respect, admiration, love, and even a hint of jealousy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
for the current Garou, even the jealous glances were just a factor to satisfy
his sense of superiority.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(Killing
one human boy is enough to make me the next head of the beast wolf race, so it
was a delicious job!)</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">About
three years ago, a boy with the potential to be the 'Master' was found, so he
was recruited into the Legion "Race Union".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
that, they checked on the boy for three months, but he was judged that the boy
is not the "Master".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
decided to kill him just in case. They took him to a dungeon where they didn't
have to worry about being seen, and it would be easier to dispose his body.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
they got a little carried away and let him escape.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">To
be precise, Garou was about to kill the boy who was stuck with an arrow in his
leg. But, the boy's hand accidentally activated a transfer magic circle. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
boy disappeared.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
did their best to look for him after that, but they couldn't find him in the
end.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Nevertheless, with that wound, the human
child had been transported to somewhere in </span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">the
world's largest , hardest and most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">.</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
would probably be attacked by monsters attracted by his blood smell and eaten
to death.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As a
result, all the members agreed that Raito is dead and notified the upper
management.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
upper management also believes them and judged that "the possibility that Raito
is still alive is low".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">They
decided to declared his death.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As a
reward for the murder of the human suspected of being the "Master",
Garou was given his current position of "The Beast Wolf leader top candidate".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Thanks
to this, he is recognized by every beast wolves he met on the street and other
beast races, and he received a large amount of money from the government.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
reward money alone is enough to live on for the rest of his life.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(Other
than us, they also created the Legion, shops, merchant guilds, and secret
organizations to search for the "Master"... In the end, I still don't
really understand what the "Master" is. Why are so many countries put
so much effort into searching for the "Master"?)</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Even
the treatment that Garou received is exceptional.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Originally,
Garou's position in the Beast Wolf race was not that good. He can't even become
a leader candidate. </span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If he
is a human being, it would be like the third son of a poor farmer in the
village who jumped to the top of the list of candidates for village chief the
next morning. And if everything going well, he would be elected for sure.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
not just Garou.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Rumor
said that each of the former members of the Race Union is making great strides
in their hometowns, just like Garou.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(I
heard that Sasha the Elf is an illegitimate child who didn't get along well
with her half-sister and was treated as someone who didn't exist. But now,
there are rumors that the royal family is talking about marrying her. The dwarf
Nano has been hired by the best blacksmiths. Diablo, the demon race, has not
only had his disinherited nobility returned to him, but his rank also
raised......)</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Drago
the dragon is the one that has made the greatest strides.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(I
didn't realize that Drago-san is a royal family member that are heirs to the
throne....... No wonder his pride is greater than the ordinary dragon races.
I've heard that his standing for the throne was low, but it went up
significantly after he killed one human....... There's a possibility he will become
the dragon race leader, the strongest of the 6 races. That's more than just a
big stride)</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Raito
was not the "Master".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Despite
this fact, they received many good treatments just by getting rid of him.</span></p>





<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">( If
Raito was the real "Master", would he have been treated better?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
that's the case, then what the hell is a "Master"?)</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Curious
and hoping for better treatment than he is getting now, he thought about
"doing his own research" on the Master, but his instincts quickly
dismissed the idea.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Just
thinking about it, he can almost smell the death that sticks to his nose.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Goosebumps
spread horribly under his fur.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(My
instinct is telling me not to get involved with the "Master" thing. If
my intuition kicks in, then it must be really bad. It has saved my life so many
times......)</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
he was a member of the Legion (Race Union), he went into the dungeons so many
times and fought many dangerous monsters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Each
time, he was saved by his beast instincts.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
former members of the "Race Union" even use Garou's "instinctive
intuition" into their consideration.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(While
there's life, there's hope. It would be a waste to get greedy and give up my
current position. I'm an orphaned, abandoned child who only good at using
violence, and now I'm the next top candidate for the Beast Wolf leader. If
things go well, the beast wolf race's top position will be mine......kuku,
fufufuhi! I can't believe this Garou-sama is the top of the beast wolf race! To
protect this position, I should forget about the "Master".</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou
is sure that their countries treat him and his other team member well as a
reward for killing Raito, who is not the "Master".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
there is no reason for him to throw away his current good treatment just for
his curiosity.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
fact, the right answer would be to forget about the "Master".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Excuse
me, may I have your attention?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"An?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
he was inwardly drawing conclusions about the "Master", a voice
called him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou
let out a grumpy sound as he was interrupted in his thought process.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
a beautiful woman is standing there and instantly blew away his grumpiness.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
black hair looked as if it had been cut from the night sky. Her hair is tied up
in a ponytail. She is wearing a well-tailored cloak, with a similar traveling
outfit underneath.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She
is tall for a woman, and her face had large eyes, long eyelashes, red rosy
lips, and a well-defined nose. Everything was perfectly arranged. Her skin is
so smooth and white that she looked like a doll that God had painstakingly
created.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Her
beauty alone is eye-catching, but she also has extremely large breasts that
push up her clothes from underneath. Her breasts are so large that men would
definitely look at them. Yet, her waist is so small that it seems like it might
break, and her arms and legs are long and slender. All this combination makes
her look very stylish.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Such
a beautiful woman of human race spoke to him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">She is
so beautiful that he question himself, "Is she human?". </span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I'm
sorry for stopping you. Are you Garou-sama, the Legion (Race union)
ex-member?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Eh,
oo, ooo."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Garou
hasn't changed his name.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So
it's not so difficult to find him.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">By
the way, the official reason for the disbandment of the "Race Union"
was that "the members felt responsible for the death of Raito in the
dungeon, and they split up".</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
beautiful woman asks with a sad expression.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Actually,
I'm looking for the whereabouts of the Lord I'm supposed to serve, Master Raito.
...... I'm sorry, I haven't told you my name yet. My name is Mei. I am a maid
who swears absolute loyalty to Raito-sama."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Oh,
ooo?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
was asked unilaterally and she already introduced herself. However, once again,
Garou could only spit out a voice that sounded like a moan.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
beautiful maid named Mei said Raito is not the second son of a poor farmer. She
could not mention the parent's name, but actually, he is a child from a noble
family. Due to circumstances, they had to ask a poor farmer to take care of
him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Finally,
his real family can welcome him with open arms, but unfortunately, Raito's
condition and location are unknown.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
searched for the Legion (Race Union) as a last effort. Still, it took a long
time to find them because the party had already disbanded.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is no hope left, but at least she wants to ask about Raito's last days. And if
possible, guide her to that place.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Just
by guiding her to the location, she will pay a lot of money. The amount is
enough to build a small house.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
danced madly inwardly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Humans
are such idiots! They're willing to pay so much gold just to guide to a kid's
death place! And this woman, after kidnapping and having enough fun with her, I
can sell her to a slave trader for more gold!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(And--)
he narrowed his eyes inwardly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(When
Raito was suspected as "Master", everything about him was
investigated not only by us but also by the countries. And yet, how is it
possible that such an extraordinary woman could be left out of the
investigation? It's too suspicious. But it's also possible that this woman is mistaking
Raito for another kid....... Anyway, it's too good opportunity to be missed.)</span></p>
ump card, which he kept in his pocket.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is the trump card that he has been carrying since before he joined the Legion
of Honor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
was confident that this would be enough to get him out of most situations. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
he agreed to Mei's offer.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
because Mei's level is too low it is extremely difficult for Garou to guide Mei
to go to the middle floor of </span><span class="calibre13">the
world's largest, hardest, and most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span class="calibre13">..</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
does not need money.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Rather,
to increase his fame, he calls out to and gathers the young wolf Beastmen who
adore Garou.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Also,
from Garou's point of view, to be able to enjoy Mei sexually is more important
than money.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
he wants to kidnap, rape, and have fun with her, it would be better to do it in
a place where no one can see them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
that sense, a dungeon is a very convenient place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(It
will be better if the country would just destroy those stupid and weak humans
who can't understand such things. Well, thanks to that, I can have a good time
like this.)</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
agreed to her request.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
discussed the departure date and time</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
manpower was immediately gathered.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
fact, when Garou, the top candidate for the Wolf Beastmen Leader is calling
out, even non-Wolf Beastmen would gather.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Like
ants attracted by the honey, many people want to do a favor and be remembered
by Garou.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the end of their departure, it took more time and effort to select the
participants than to decide on which route to take..</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the end, 10 young Wolf Beastmen with levels around 150 were recruited.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
Garou and Mei, it is a large group of 12 people.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Unlike
the Race Union, they have more Beastmen members, but their level is not so high.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is why they used numbers to make up the difference.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Also,
due to their racial traits, Beastmen are good at fighting in a group rather
than alone. This is the reason why they decided to prepare a big party.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thanks
to Beastmen sharp smelling sense, they reached the destination without fighting
any monster. Despite the fact that their destination is the middle floor of </span><span class="calibre13">the world's largest, hardest, and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span class="calibre13">.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is where Raito-sama--"</span></mmjured by a monster's surprise attack here. He was also unlucky
enough to get caught in a randomly placed transfer trap and disappeared from
our sight."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
held her mouts
holding in her grief.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
that moment, her black hair ponytail shook like a dog mourning for her master
that she will never see again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
explaining the fake story to her, Garou looked at the young men he brought with
him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Since
they had moey
could block the entrance to prevent Mei from escaping.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Originally,
this place is only a space to rest before entering the middle level of Naraku,
and there is only one entrance. The ceiling is high, and the space is large,
making it a perfect place to take a break.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Very
few adventurers can use this place, located inside </span><span class="calibre13">the world's largest, hardest, and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span class="calibre13">.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
they block this entrance, Mei will have no way to escape.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the contrary, if the entrance is blocked, they will lose their way to escape.......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
didn't pay any attention to their movements and continued to mourn.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
inwardly mocking her, "Humans really are so easy", Garou continued to
play the compassionate role.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It
was too sudden, and we couldn't respond fast enough. With that wound, probably
he would not last long. I'm sorry I couldn't protect him even though I was with
him......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
must be really painful. In this dark and dirty place, you were betrayed and
tortured by those bastards...... If I could have been there for you sooner, it
won't end like that. I'm so ashamed of myself."</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">".........You?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Without
listening to Garou's comfort words, Mei cries alone as she thinks about the
Legion (Race Union) betrayal that happened almost three years ago.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
takes a while for Garou to understand Mei's self-talk.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
slowly distanced himself from her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young people began to notice the change in Garou's behavior and began to get
nervous.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Once
he had gained some distance, he asked.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......Who
are you? Why do you know that?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
was suspected as the "Master" and they planned to kill him in the
dungeon just to be safe, but before they killed him, he touched a transfer trap
and disappeared.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Only
a few people know about this fact.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei,
who had not listened to his comfort word earlier, responded to that question.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
let go of the hand that had been holding her mouth and slowly turned to look at
them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
eyes' color was tinged with anger, so much so that it could be seen even in the
dark.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
have told you that I am only loyal to Raito-sama. If you insult my maid way,
I'll make you see the color of your own guts right here and now."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Huh?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not just Garou.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fur of all the Beastmen in the room is standing upright.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei's
intimidating vibe has overwhelmed the beastmen race, which is said to have
superior strength, sensory organs, and fighting ability compared to the human
race.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
if they are drifting in the ocean and something enormous moving right below
them. They can feel the terror coming from Mei.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Ah,
the opponent is just a human female. She is easy prey. After having fun with
her in this dungeon, I'll sell her to a slave dealer for gold coins! But what's
this overwhelming feeling of fear? As if I am standing in front of a monster
that emerged from hellfire!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
abnormal situation makes the other Beastmen start screaming and break up their
formation. </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ga,
Garou-san, what...</span> <span class="calibre13">what's going on here?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"<i class="calibre7">A, aniki</i>, you said this is an easy job!?
Did you lie to us!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are
you trying to kill us all so you can switch to the other side and survive by
yourself? ......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Garou
aniki is betraying us!? That's a lie, right?!"</span></p>

<p>The young men were shaken by shaken by Mei's extraordinary intimidation and began to suspect
Garou for suggesting the idea.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Beastmen
basically value their comrades. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to work
together to hunt monsters and raise their levels.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
if one of them betrays the group, he will be punished severely as an example.
The kind of punishment that makes one wish for death.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You,
you dumbass! I'm the top candidate for the Wolf Beastmen Leader! Why would I
give up my current good position to go to another country!? Use your head, idiots!
Or maybe you want to against me, the top candidate for the Wolf Beastmen Leader?
Instead of having a good time, you'll get hurt when we get back... "</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
threatens with a loud voice to clear his suspicions, but he couldn't finish his
lines.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Because
the person who was supposed to be dead casually showed up and raised his voice
as if he was just back from taking a walk.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Mei,
don't touch them yet. Especially Garou, he's my prey."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
the Beastmen all turned around, the voice coming from behind them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
is wearing a black hood and holding a mage's staff in his hand that exceeded
his height.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
isn't too tall, and if they guess base on his voice, he's 12 or 13 years old
boy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Beastmen
race has a sensitive nose. They immediately noticed that the other party is a
human.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
on the other hand, they are confused.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In the world's largest, hardest, and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span class="calibre13">, why is there a human child
that can stand behind them without being noticed?</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
the boy appeared, the overwhelming intimidation vanished as if it had never
been there in the first place.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he called out to her, Mei's expression was changed, but she gave off a sweet,
mellow vibe like a maiden in love.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
boy lightly raises his hand in reply and pulls down his hood.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
they expected, a human child appeared from under the hood.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
neatly cut and arranged hair is shiny, his eyes are large, and his eyelashes
are long enough to create shadows.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
skin is a healthy milk color like a child, and combined with his rose-colored
lips, he looks more like a "beautiful girl" than a "boy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
seems to be a boy who would be very popular.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
before he pulled down his hood, Garou is the only one who was still stunned in shock.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Im,
impossible ... you still live ... Raito?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"...
Garou. I came to take revenge for what you did three years ago."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was as if he is meeting a friend for the first time in a long time. The boy, Raito,
smiled at his revenge target.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
the child who is standing behind the Beastmen called out to him, Garou looks surprised.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
Garou's stupid look of surprise did not last long.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
never thought you are still alive......kukuku, moreover revenge? A level 15 weakling
like you want to get revenge! Gyahahahaha! I'm grateful that humans are
stupid!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou,
who had been frightened by Mei earlier, laughed as if he had been given gold and
silver treasures, a luxurious meal, and a wide selection of beautiful women.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
laughing all the way through, he makes an ugly smile, just like he did when
betraying Raito.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
don't know how you survived, but I'm surprised you dare to show your face in
front of me! If we kill this being and bring back his corpse, then the beastmen
race can do a favor to the dragon race! This is huge! Instead of just being the
top candidate, I'll be the Wolf Beastmen Leader for sure!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13"></span></p>Garou's lustful eyes and voice, Raito sighs as if he was disgusted.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/5c4mybK/000015.jpg" height="500" width="330"></img>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Anyway,
I've already checked out Raito, down to the number of wrinkles in his ass. He's
just a regular guy who got a slightly unusual and useless gift. He's probably
just lucky to be alive and was rescued by that creepy lady over there,
right?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......well,
that is not wrong."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
doesn't have to explain the details of skill and the "Infinite Gacha"
gift to them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
Raito's answer, Garou was convinced that his assumption was correct.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Did
you think that the girl who helped you can fight us and take revenge? You're
naive! You can't see the difference in power!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Garou
looked down at the Raito again and then clicked his tongue and gave
instructions to the young people standing in a blank stare, unable to follow
the situation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ow!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">What
the hell are you standing there for?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Don't
you have the brains to understand the situation? <span>With his
corpse, we can make the dragon race owe us a favor, and then </span>I'll be the
Beastmen wolf leader for sure! If you want to have a good time, quickly block
the doorway so they can't escape, you idiots!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Partly
because Garou is the leader of this project, he had given the order, but the
fact that they could make the Dragon Race owe them is the most important thing
for them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dragon race is the most superior of the six races.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Which
means they can make the country owe them a favor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
them, this is extremely important.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I understand Garou <i class="calibre7">aniki</i>! We'll seize
them soon! Hey, you guys, turn behind!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Understood!
Hey, let's go!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"OK!
We are also aides to the Wolf Beastmen Leader! Finally, our luck is here!"</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
the strength of their legs, two people moved at high speed to block the entrance....
but. Like fragile dolls, their heads broke off their necks and rolled on the
ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Like
decapitated chickens, the two bodies ran for a while without heads and finally
stopped when they hit a wall.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
hands and feet twitch as blood spurts out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dungeon was filled with the thick smell of blood.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
won't let you go behind us."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Before
they knew it, Mei is standing by Raito's side.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">From
what she just said, it seems that Mei was the one who cut off the two heads, but......
Garou and the others have no idea how she did it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
they noticed, the heads were already rolling on the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
Garou and the other Beastmen are shocked, Raito casually praised Mei as if it's
natural for her to do that.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you, Mei. Continue to block the entrance to keep them from escaping."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
sir. I swear on my maid's way, I'll carry out your command perfectly."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
bowed deeply and stepped backward to block the entrance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
faced Garou and the others again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
and Mei blocked the entrance.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
the Beastmen, who usually look down on humans, were shocked when they saw Mei's
ability.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Also,
in front of Raito, who look so confident, they felt scared and want to flee.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
is the only one who turned red and yelled.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Calm
down, you idiots! I don't know how, but they were only killed by a surprise
attack!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">If we're careful, we won't be defeated
by humans!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"*<i class="calibre7">Yareyare</i>.......You still looking down on
other people just like three years ago. Do you think we're weak?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
mess with me! We can't be weaker than humans who can't even level up!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other Beastmen nodded in agreement to Garou's words.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is the reason for their contempt for the human race.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Dwarves
are strong and skillful and can make powerful weapons and armor, making it easy
to level up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elves
excel in magic and have a long lifespan, so they can easily reach high levels.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dragon race and the demon race have strong physical strength, high magic power,
high vitality, and long life expectancy. This is why there are many high-level
people among them (in comparison, the dragon race tends to have a higher level
than the demon race because of their higher basic abilities).</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the other hand, the human race has a harder time leveling up than other
species. Their physical strength is weaker, their magic power is lower, their
bodies are more fragile, and their lifespan is shorter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
basically, their level is overwhelmingly lower than other races.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The Beastmen
race has lower magic power and the same lifespan as humans, but they have
overwhelmingly stronger physical strength, vitality, and speed than humans.
Besides, they are strong in group battles, and their sharp senses make it easy
for them to find their prey, which is another factor that makes it easy to
raise their level.</span></p>

is "generally lower level than other race", that's why
the human race is looked down by other races.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
Garou and his friends now look down on Raito and Mei as "lower-level"
and "can't be stronger than them".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You're
getting carried away, human. ...... I'm going to rip off your disguise right
now! All of you, work together with me!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
is using the same steel claws as three years ago and kicks the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other Beastmen joined in the attack, though they were a beat behind his call.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The Beastmen
was the best of all the races when it came to coordination. Even though they are
improvising, they show more coordination than a skilled human party.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Die!
You shitty human who got carried away!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Claws,
kicks, swords, short spears, and knives flew at him from all directions, but Raito
didn't take a single step and flips his staff to repel all the attack.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gee
!?"</span></p>

<p>"Gugoo!"</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ngigyi
!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
screamed like a pig that had been kicked. The Beastmen, including Garou that
had attacked him, was easily knocked down.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
Raito looks down at the Beastmen crawling on the ground in pain, he talks as if he already felt bored.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What's
wrong? Is it over?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
one word seriously hurt Garou's pride.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
crawled to the ground, his eyes bleeding as he pressed his hand to his wounded abdomen.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Huh?
You just a human, and you dare to look down on me! You just a human, and you
dare to look down on me!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6"></span>

<p><span class="calibre13">You
just a human, don't you dare to look down on me! I'm the 'top candidate leader
for the Beastmen wolf'! Humans don't have the right to looked down on me! Shit!
But you didn't finish me. That carelessness will cost you death!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He moved
his hand from his painful abdomen and groped in his pocket.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
takes out a ping-pong ball-sized glowing ball.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
uses his "trump card" without hesitation.</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
don't know what tricks you use, but don't get carried away just because you got
a little stronger! I'll have your face painted in despair in no time! Come out,
Demon Beast Fenrir!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Without
hesitation, Garou uses his "trump card" - the Beast Magic Ball.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Beast Magic Ball is a magic item that is rarely found in ruins or dungeons. It
contains a high-level magical beast.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">By
breaking the ball, one can temporarily summon a high-level monster and bring it
under his control. However, it is only temporary and will disappear in about an
hour.</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Many
first-class adventurers, like Garou, keep it in their possession to get out of
a tight spot.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, the price is very high. The lowest price is....... 100 million in Japanese yen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
monster that had been sealed up appears when he broke the Beast Magic Ball.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
gigantic wolf about 7 meters long with pale blue fur appears.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Grrrrrrr!"
He growled menacingly at Raito and the others.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
laughs loudly. His expression is full of confidence in his victory.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gyahahahaha!
I've been saving my "trump card" just for such an emergency. A level
500 demon beast, Fenrir! Your luck ran out when you got carried away and didn't
kill me earlier!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
appearance of Fenrir, a level 500 demon beast, reenergized the Beastmen that
had been easily defeated by Raito.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
a beautiful and powerful magical beast......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
expected, Garou's aniki who used to be a member of the Top Legion. I didn't
know he had such a secret skill."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is the ability of a first-class adventurer, the top candidate of the Wolf
Beastmen Leader!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
expected from Garou-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young people looked respectfully at Garou and Fenrir, the level 500 magical
beast. They look like boys in front of a professional soccer player.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the other side, Raito let out a sigh of disgust at their stupidity.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Level
500?....... Is that really a 'trump card'? That's way too weak."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gyahahahaha!
You said Level 500 is weak. It seems facing Fenrir makes you crazy!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I'm
sure that the trick that repels us earlier was some kind of magic item power! But
this is the real one, level 500. I'm going to blow away all your little tricks!
Why don't you crawl on the ground and beg for your life? If you could make me
laugh by seeing you begging for your life, I might change my mind and not kill
you. Yeah, do it quickly!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, Garou had no intention to let Raito alive even if he begged for his
life.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other young people besides Garou understood this and looked down at Raito with
a smirk.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the other side, Raito let out a bored sigh. Instead of begging for his life, he
urges them to attack.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Really?
A demon beast with level 500 is a trump card... OK, OK, I won't move a step
from here, so you can do whatever you want."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
spread his hands out to provoke his opponent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
matter who sees it, he didn't move a step as declared. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, Garou's face turned red at his provocative behavior and get mad.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then,
as your wish, I'll kill you without leaving any bones! Demon Beast Fenrir, Do
it! </span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Demon
Beast Roar Cannon!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"WOOOOOOo!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
person who breaks the Demon Ball is temporarily recognized as the master of the
Demon Beast and can know its level, characteristics, specialties, weaknesses,
and abilities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
uses his power to order the Demon Beast Fenrir to use its most powerful attack,
the Demon Beast Roar Cannon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is a Demon Beast Fenrir's special attack that releases all magical power.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Together
with its roar, the demon beast opens his mouth widely, bluish-white magic power
is focused---then fired!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
converted all the magic power of his level 500 into an attack,</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Certainly,
that was a deadly blow. Even if the opponent has the same level or higher
level, anyone who was hit by that attack would be fatally injured.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"For
attacks that can only raise dust, the beast was too noisy. Such a nuisance."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Im,
impossible. ...... he, he is unharmed......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Despite
being hit head-on by the Demon Beast Roar Cannon, Raito didn't have any
scratch, not even scorch on his hair or clothes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Demon Beast Roar Cannon is a level 500 Fenrir deathly attack. It is not
something that can be prevented with half-baked defenses or magic items.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
that's what happens......it would only be possible if there is a huge
difference in power and level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
and all the Beastmen who praised the Demon Beast Fenrir are staring at Raito in
a daze.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
smiled lightly without paying any attention to them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Next
is my turn."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He reaches
his pocket like Garou and takes out a card.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It
would be a pity if people misunderstood that such a pathetic stray is Fenrir.
That's why I'll especially show you the "real thing". UR card
"Divine Beast Fenrir Level 9000", release."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As Raito's
speaks, the card is glowing.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
light quickly faded, and a beast appeared.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
15 meters height giant beast. Its fur is as white as snow, and its fangs look
very powerful.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
explanation is needed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Everyone
understands at a glance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
being in front of them is the real Fenrir.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Certainly,
if you know about the God Beast Fenrir Level 9000, then the Demon Beast Fenrir
Level 500 would only look like a pathetic stray dog.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
speaks with a childish high voice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Fenrir,
kill that stray dog."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oouw!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the command of his Lord, "God Beast,<span>&nbsp;
</span>Fenrir" barks lightly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Just
by raising one hand and waving it with a light motion, "Fenrir the Demon
Beast" or the fake Fenrir is torn vertically, becomes ice chunks, cracks,
and then disappears like dust.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
its remains disappeared from this world, not even a single hair left behind. As
if the "Demon Beast Fenrir level 500" never existed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Great,
good job.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Wan!
Ouw!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
praised him for killing the Demon Beast Fenrir as ordered and patted him as a
reward.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Fenrir is praised by his master like a pet dog, waving his tail as if he is
happy to be patted.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
looks at them with envious eyes as Raito patted and praised the "God Beast
Fenrir."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the other side, Garou and the rest of the Beastmen are.......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ah,
Aaaah ..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hii,
hii, hii"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">“…………”</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
all couldn't help but scream and fell to their knees.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Of
course, Garou was also scared and shocked. His fear of a situation he couldn't
understand caused him to lose his strength and fall on his ass.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What,
you, e, eliminate a level 500 Fenrir, in, in an instant ..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Even
if I didn't summon the "God Beast Fenrir", I could easily kill that
kind of demon beast in a heartbeat. Because my level now is 9999."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"...
What?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Because
my level is 9999."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Like
Garou earlier, Raito also disclosed his status.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
status is indeed showing "Level 9999".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
color of the Beastmen's faces became even worse.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
looking at them, Raito tells them something that makes them feel more
desperate.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Not
just me. Mei also has the same level. Mei."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At Raito's
call, she silently disclosed her status.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Like
Raito, her status is displaying "Level 9999".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The Beastmen's
expression is filled with despair and lets out their voice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Le,
level 9999 ..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It,
it can be true..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Huh,
isn't the human level limit is only about 100?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"There's
no way we can win against that..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">None
of the young Beastmen could deny the fact that they were facing a level of
9999.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
summoned the God Beast Fenrir that easily slaughters a level 500 Fenrir right
in front of them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
also fell on his ass and can't stand up due to fear after seeing the God Beast
Fenrir one blow kill.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
one in that place could deny Raito's words.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
stares at the Raito with a blue face that is covered with sweat like a
waterfall.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Why......why
didn't I notice that ......? Raito hadn't grown at all since three years ago?
Why didn't I notice that?)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
was a twelve-year-old kid from a farming village.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">About
three years have passed since then, and he must be fifteen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
age of 12 to 15 is a human growth period when a boy grows taller, his throats
appear, and his face becomes more mature.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
would be weird if he didn't change.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But Raito
hasn't changed at all.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito's
appearance had not changed from when they betrayed and tried to kill him three
years ago.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
why is this "impossible phenomenon" occurring?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Level
9999 isn't just a bluff thought up by this stupid kid....... If it's true, then
it makes sense that he's stopped aging and such a "God Beast Fenrir"
willing to follow his command. This means that Raito has really become a level
9999 monster.......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
be precise, it's not because of his level, but thanks to the power of the
"Immortality Bracelet", a mythical artifact item he drew from the
"Infinity Gacha" that makes him immortal.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
remember the despair, sorrow, and anger of being betrayed, Raito uses the
Bracelet of Immortality to maintain the appearance of a 12-year-old.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Garou finally believed Raito's words and horrified, the other Beastmen curled
their tails with desperate look and voice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ga,
Garou <i class="calibre7">aniki</i>..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ga,
Garou-sama, what we are going to do?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
should we do, Garou <i class="calibre7">aniki</i>..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
group of young beastmen recruited and brought to Naraku with the promise of a
good reward is begging for instructions from their leader, Garou.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are waiting for instructions on what to do and how to save their lives.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
eyes focus on Garou at once ...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
is crawling on the ground with a blue face.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
really sorry for my rudeness so far! I--I was deceiving Raito-sama on the
orders of the government! It's not my own will! So, please forgive me! I don't
care what happens to these guys, so please save me! I beg you!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ga,
Garou's <i class="calibre7">aniki</i>! Are you betraying
us?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Co,
coward! Don't you have any shame in turning your back on us now!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Shut
up!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I'm
not like you guys! I did indeed betray Raito-sama once. But when Raito-sama
came to town, I took care of him in many ways, didn't I! Isn't that right, Raito-sama?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
is smiling, rubbing his hands, and flattering Raito as if his previous attitude
was just a lie.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
bought him <i class="calibre7">kushiyaki</i> at a food stall,
and I've even given him fruit juice to drink. I've even fought and chased away
people who were mocking Raito-sama!? Right?! I'm sure I have memories with Raito-sama,
things that we shared together! That's why it must be fine if I am the only one
he would save!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
silently looked down at Garou, who was on his knees and flattering him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the meantime, the other Beastmen continued to blame Garou.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
a while, Raito raised his hand lightly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he raised his hand, the loud and ugly cursing that had been painful to hear
earlier stopped.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
dungeon went into silence as if they are in a graveyard late at night.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
looks down at Garou and asks.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Before
I help you, let's talk about what you know. First of all, what exactly is a
'master'?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I don't know. All, all I know is that I've been told by higher-ups to look for the
"Master"......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Why
is the country looking for the "Master"?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
don't know."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Why
did the country want to kill me when they found out I am not the
"Master"?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I, don't know."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raitou
is looking to get more impatient with his answers. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
hurriedly made an excuse.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I really don't know! I've only been told to look for the "Master"!
It's just my guess, but I suspect that the Beastmen races chiefs also don't
know much about that. After all, we are better than humans. This, this is just a
common perception, but thanks to our high physical ability, we can easily raise
our level. From another race's point of view, we have a lower lifespan, lower
level, and lower ability. At most, they only think of us as a pawn that can be
used slightly more useful than the human race. That's why they didn't give much
information to the chiefs."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
What do the other Beastmen know about the "Master"?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
question made all the other Beastmen's brain spin more than ever before in
their lives as if they had found a glimmer of hope for survival.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
none of them had any information about the "Master".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"..........."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
turns around and looks at Mei.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
understood his intentions and nodded.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
uses her lie-detection magic to check their reactions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Apparently,
they really don't know anything about the "Master" and why Raito was targeted
for his life.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
let out a sigh of disappointment at this result.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
had expected this, but there's even less information than I
expected......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
should we do?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
responds to Mei's question with a soft voice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Now
that they've seen us, there's no reason to keep them alive. Except Garou
dispose them all."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Certainly."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
soon as Mei bowed, everyone except Garou was chopped up into small pieces.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
didn't even have time to scream.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
her glove, Mei had created an ultra-thin thread and entangled the Beastmen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
thread is very thin, but it is sharp enough to shred steel or *orichalcum when
she applied her magic into it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hiii......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou's
pants were wet because of the tragedy in front of him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Fortunately,
even if he wet himself, people couldn't tell because the blood smell is so
strong.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
was completely unaffected and look into his own pockets.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Now
that we've gotten rid of the disturbances and got the people we want let's move
on... Oh, I almost forgot. Garou."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hiii!
Yyes!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The completely
terrified Garou subconsciously jumped when he heard Raito calling him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">At
the same time, pools of blood rippled, sprinkled, and pieces of flesh
scattered.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
let out a slight chuckle at his ridiculous appearance and asked.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Before
we move on, let me ask you, do you think we could win a war against the nations
of the surface with what we have now?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Tha,
that is......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
times like this, it would be best for him to lie to not spoil Raito's mood ...
but Mei, who is using lie detection magic, would be able to tell his lie.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
if it's just flattery, a lie won't do any good now.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
mustered up his courage to express his thoughts through his throat.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Raito-sama
and the others are indeed strong, and yes, Fenrir-sama is here too. I think if
we fight against countries around the world, we will have some advantages. But,
no matter how high the level is, an individual is still an individual. It's
almost impossible to win against a nation......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
all, no matter how strong an individual is, the scope of his or her power is
limited.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
matter how he looks at it, it's tough for an individual to take on the giant
creature that is the nation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
had also predicted this.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
continues his word.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"There
is a possibility that there are other legendary weapons, armor, and items that
have been stored in each country for thousands of years. If they were taken
out, no matter how strong Raito-sama and the others are, half, or even one-third
of the world will be destroyed......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
I see. ...... It's just as we expected. No matter how strong a person is,
things he can do individually is limited."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
hearing all his answers, Raito nodded several times in satisfaction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
turns to Garou once again and gives his order.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Next
is similar to the previous question, but I want you to confirm, 'Can I win if I
wage war against the countries on the surface with this force?'"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hah...?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then
let's move immediately. Transfer, release."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Simultaneously,
as Raito speaks, the three of them and one beast are surrounded by light.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
is the only one surprised, and and his vision turned black and white.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
and the God Beast Fenrir show no particular reaction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
a moment, their eyesight went dark, but it soon came back to normal.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">！！！！？？？？</span><span class="calibre13">"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
eyesight came back, but the sight spread out in front of them would make people
who saw it feel so desperate; it's darker and harder than tar.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">By
using the "Transfer" card, Garou was instantly transferred to the
bottom level of </span><span class="calibre13">the
world's largest, hardest, and most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span class="calibre13">.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">What
awaited him there was an army of mythical monsters.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In a
hall the size of a soccer field, with ceilings so high that it can't be seen
through the haze, the monsters are waiting in an orderly manner.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
bright red carpet runs along the room's length, a throne of gold, jewels, and
precious metals is placed at the other end. A huge military flag is displayed
on the wall at the end of the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
front of the throne, just before the stairs, there are three beautiful girls
lined up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Also,
a huge dragon, a giant, and a three-headed dog as huge as the "God Beast
Fenrir. It's not just the scary monsters.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Beautiful
girls are wearing maid clothes with transparent wings growing from their backs.
Knights are wearing dazzling, gorgeous golden armor. A beautiful woman holds a
huge battle-ax in her hands without any difficulty. There was also a girl with
a long spear-like tube and a musket, which Garou couldn't understand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
number is probably around 3000.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
first glance, there is a wide variety of things that seem inconsistent, but
somehow Garou senses that they are united by one strong will - a crazy sense of
loyalty.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though they face a mythical monster's army, Raito looks relaxed and casually gives
a command.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Everyone,
show your status."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
voice is definitely not reaching the back of the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">And
yet, without delay, everyone displayed their status as instructed so that a
third party could see it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aah
...... Aaah ...... aaaah!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
couldn't help but let out a faint scream.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fairy maids of level 500 lined up in his sight, the odd-shaped monsters level
is around 1000 to 9000, and level 5000 golden armor soldier at the corner.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
three beautiful girls standing in front of the throne have the highest level,
same as Mei and Raito. They have reached level 9999.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
walks out on the red carpet laid out in the middle of the army with their
status displayed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
follows him, and the "God Beast Fenrir" moves to a corner where the
giants were gathered.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
is the only one stay on his spot.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Every
time Raito walked on the carpet and passed by the army, the high-level monsters
would kneel down and bow their heads.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
behavior looks so normal, natural, no,.... they did that as if serving Raito is
the noblest and loving act in this world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
walks down the red carpet with the gesture, as if it's only natural for them to
serve him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
three beautiful girls who were waiting in front of the throne also kneeled down
affectionately.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
also joined the line, joyfully serve him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
walked up the stairs without stopping.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
ascended the stairs and sat down on the throne, which is so luxurious that it
looks like something that never existed in this world.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Raise
your heads."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
mythical monsters faithfully follow Raito's instructions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
all raise their heads perfectly in order.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
asks Garou, who is still sitting down on the red carpet.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is the power I've gathered for three years. Garou, let me ask you again -- 'If
I wage war against the nations of the surface with this force, will I win?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aa,
aaaah,......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
did not answer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No,
his desperate expression is the answer.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(What
is this, have I wandered into a mythical world? There are so many monsters that
I can't even count. They've been building their power at the bottom of
Naraku...... I'm not sure if the weapons, armor, and items the countries have
been gathered for thousands of years will work against these monsters.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
person who prepared all this was a child from a poor farming family.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Legion members, including Garou, inwardly looked down on him. In the end, they
betrayed, mocked, and tried to kill him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
hasn't changed a bit since three years ago.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Now
the Lord of Destruction is sitting on his throne, smiling innocently like a
little child.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
the boy possesses the power to end the world easily, just like breaking a toy
block.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(......
Oh, I see. We tried to kill Raito, and that's why I got into this mess.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
realized.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Before
his betrayal, Raito was just a simple kid, or in bad terms, a naive kid.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13"><span>&nbsp;</span>A normal kid with normal moral senses which he
can found anywhere.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
Raito has changed because Garou and the others betrayed him and tried to get
rid of him under various countries' orders. Or perhaps it would be better to
say that he has learned. He knew that he was destined to be used and dumped.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Then,
under the various nations' orders, the Legion (Race Union) work together to
kill Raito, and that's when he learned. The simple fact, if he doesn't kill
them, he will be killed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If Raito
didn't notice that fact, he would never prepare an overwhelming army that
spread out in front of him now.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
since they had pointed their fangs first, so he would use this mighty power
without hesitation. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was the country that tried to kill him. If he is going to show his fangs, he
should be prepared to attack. Therefore, he does not care if thousands, ten
thousand, hundred thousand, or hundred million corpses are going to pile up.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
had created the worst existence with their own hands, one that could destroy
the world they ruled.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
is in despair. His proud hair was turning white and falling out. Without trying
to hide it, he continued to shed tears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
finally smiles in satisfaction when he sees his condition.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Silence
is golden, eloquence is silver. I knew I was right to choose Garou first. He's
not good at thinking since his Legion days, but his instincts are as sharp as
an animal's. From his reaction, it seems that we have enough power to fight and
destroy the nations."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
laughed and then turned a cold gaze to Garou.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'll
give you a reward. I'll let you live until I know the truth and decide whether
or not to give an end to everyone except the human race. You can't die. Make
sure you can't die even if you wanted to."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aaaaah,
aaaaaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaaaaaaah!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
screams out loud for the first time since he arrived here.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
didn't bother holding back his scream of despair because imagining the torture
he would have to endure until Raito made his decision.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
had created the strongest and worst demon lord with their own hands, and he
went mad when he realized that races other than the human race could become
extinct depending on Raito's mood.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Monsters
stepped up from both sides of Garou as he continued to scream and go crazy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Garou
did not show any sign of running away, nor did he care about his hair turning
gray and falling out. He asks Raito a question.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
are you? what? ...... Are you a fairy tale monster that will end the world?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
raised his hand lightly at this question.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
stopped the monsters that were trying to take him to jail.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the Lord's command, the monsters stopped as if he had pressed the pause button.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
answers Garou's question with an easy-going attitude.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
not a 'fairytale monster' or that kind of great existence. I just want to take
revenge on you all and find why they want to kill me like a bug and know the
truth. After taking revenge and knowing the truth, I will return to my original
life. Rather, with the power of this "Infinite Gacha" gift, I'm going
to help people, be useful to the world."</span></p>
