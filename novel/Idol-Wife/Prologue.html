<h3>Prologue</h3>

<div>"Kazuto-kun. What does this mean?" (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>After school. In the room of a high school girl idol.</div><div>In a corner of the neat and tidy room, I was forced to sit on the floor.</div><div><br /></div><div>Standing in front of me was Mizuki Rinka, a beautiful girl with long hair.</div><div>She was looking down at me with frozen eyes, a silent menacing aura was emitted from her whole body.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kazuto-kun, I ask you one more time, Who are these girls?" (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rinka showed the screen of a smartphone in her palm.</div><div>What displayed there was friend list of a certain MMO.</div><div>There was a list of amusing names of online game players (only 5).&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>"They are... just ordinary players. We just happened to be together in a dungeon the other day and then we became friends." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Is that so. then you cheated on me while I was logged out." (Rinka)</div><div>"Absolutely no! Because those people are hode! The avatar of theirs are beautiful girls, but they are actually old men(?)!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I hurriedly excuse myself when I was glared at by her beautiful yet sharp eyes.</div><div>But Rinka wasn't convinced, she scraped her hair up and said, <i>"Don't make any excuses"</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Excuses eh... You think I have a strange relationship with old men?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"It was what I think." (Rinka)</div><div>"Why! It's really shocking to me that you answered immediately without hesitation..." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Kazuto-kun might have a fÎµtish for Hodes." (Rinka)</div><div>"I don't have such a tendency, absolutely don't have!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Let me affirm. <b>Absolutely</b> <b>impossible</b>!</div><div>Let me affirm one more thing! They are not hodes!</div><div>They simply just men who were playing using beautiful girl characters.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Is that really the case? I can't deny the possibility that Kazuto-kun will get tired of me and run for an oldie hode." (Rinka)</div><div>"I want you to deny that possibility! Even if I get tired of Rinka, I absolutely won't run to some random old men!" (Kazuto)</div><div>"...That so. As I thought, you tired of me after all." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rinka sadly hung her face down.</div><div>She looked like she was about to shed tears.</div><div><br /></div><div>"For example! Suppose that Rinka and I are friends from middle school? It's not like I will getting tired or anything like that." (Kazuto)</div><div>"... Prove it." (Rinka)</div><div>"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Prove to me that Kazuto-kun pledged his eternal-undying love to me." (Rinka)</div><div>"N, no no...." (Kazuto)</div><div><br />

</div><div>Th, that's exaggeratedly heavy. To pledge eternal-undying love, was quite a problem.</div><div><i>Because we are...</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"We're married, aren't we? On the internet, though." (Rinka)</div><div>"Y-yeah, I guess so, but in real life, we're------." (Kazuto)</div><div>"In real life.... what was it?" (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rinka asked with a cold and powerful tone.</div><div>This is as if you are being confronted with choices that will take you straight to the bad end.</div><div><b>A</b> or <b>B</b>. <i><span style="color: #800180;">(PTW/N: ERABE!!!! XD,, somehow I remember anime NouCome)</span></i></div><div>It is a hellish game that does not even have load option, let alone save.</div><div>I carefully chose the words while breaking out in a cold sweat.</div><div><br /></div><div>"In real life... we're close and get along well. Very close and get along very well." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Yup, we are. We also have fostered an absolute bond, like a mature couple." (Rinka)</div><div>"..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>We were <i>not</i> even dating, though.</div><div>It's not even a month since we met in real life.</div><div><br />
</div><div>"Surely, I've been busy with my idol activities. Still, I've never forgotten Kazuto-kun even a second." (Rinka)</div><div>"E-ee......" (Kazuto)</div><div>"So, don't forget about me okay, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div>"O-of course." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thank you..... So I'm going to delete all your friends except me." (Rinka)</div><div>"Okay&#8213;&#8213;no, why! Even though they are nice people!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>"Then, let's do this. Next time, I'll talk to them one-on-one. If I find out that they don't have any ill feelings with Kazuto-kun, I'll approve them to be friends." (Rinka)</div><div>"If you do that much, I'll be very embarrassed, you know." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>"This is the lowest line I can make concessions. If you don't, please give up on friends other than me." (Rinka)</div><div>"Seriously. I'd like to ask you to review the minimum line..." (Kazuto)</div><div>"I can't." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>The plea was rejected with a snap.</div><div>Apparently, Rinka is serious.</div><div><br /></div><div>Haaaa...</div><div><i>Why did this happen?</i></div><div>It was two weeks ago, that my entire life took a drastic turn.</div><div><br /></div><div>An online friend who I got married with in the game, actually was a popular idol and even my classmate.</div>
