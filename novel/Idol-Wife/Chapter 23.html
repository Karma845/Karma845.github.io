<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; The First Date of the Couple In-Game</h3>

<div class="calibre5">The day of the date is here.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a beautiful day with a clear blue sky.</div><div class="calibre5">The meeting place is at a square in front of the station.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm there before Rinka, and sit on a bench waiting for the appointed time to arrive.</div><div class="calibre5">"...... My gosh, I definitely came too early." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I check the time on my phone and it's showing 11:02.</div><div class="calibre5">By the way, the appointed time is 12:00.</div><div class="calibre5">It's an hour early. There's a reason for this.</div><div class="calibre5">It's Kurumizaka-san's instruction.</div><div class="calibre5">Considering Rinka's personality, she will come early, so I was told that I should come earlier and surprise her.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Is she really coming early?</i></div><div class="calibre5">As I'm mindlessly watching people pass by in the square, I hear an incoming call from the smartphone in my pocket.</div><div class="calibre5">I confirm that it's come from Kurumizaka-san and accept the call.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Hello, Kurumizaka-san?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Mornin~, Kazu-kun! You're there really early, yes~, thank you!" (Nana)</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Well, I am. If this is the kind of thing that makes Rinka happy, then....... I mean, are you watching me somewhere?"</i>&nbsp;(Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I am. Look closely at the apartment building behind you."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"......Apartment?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">As I turn around, I see a scene of buildings standing in a row.</div><div class="calibre5">I notice a pure white apartment building in the middle of them.</div><div class="calibre5">I strain my eyes to get a better look.</div><div class="calibre5">On the landing of the upper floor, I can see a girl dressed in black, looking at me with binoculars.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"...... is that you, Kurumizaka-san?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Yahhoo~!"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san, a girl in black, waving her hand with such a cheerful voice.</div><div class="calibre5">......It's a very suspicious appearance.</div><div class="calibre5">She may have thought if she's wearing a disguise so that her true identity will not be revealed, but contrarily, she appears terribly conspicuous and suspicious.</div><div class="calibre5">If she is going to appear in a mystery drama, she'll be so suspicious that she'll be eliminated from the list of criminal candidates.</div><div class="calibre5">I've always had a thought that Kurumizaka-san may be a rather unique person.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Hey, Kurumizaka-san. Are you sure Rinka will be here an hour early?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Yup, she'll definitely~. Because even last night on the phone, she said with great happiness, <span class="calibre19">'It's like a dream to be able to hang out with Kazuto-kun in real-life'</span>."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Huuuuh......."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I can kind of see her face at that moment, somehow.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Moreover, she was smiling and worrying about not being able to sleep at all because she was looking forward to it so much."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Somehow it looks like an elementary school student preparing for an excursion, she is."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">By the way, I was a part of who thinks that school excursion is annoying.</div><div class="calibre5">When I was in elementary school, I wanted to play online games rather than excursions.</div><div class="calibre5">When I think about it, I had a glimpse of being a nerd gamer from that time.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Rin-chan still hasn't arrived there yet?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I don't know............. Ah, isn't that the one?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Eh, which one,&nbsp;</i><i class="calibre6">which one</i><i class="calibre6">?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">I tell Kurumizaka-san what she looks like to me who seems to be looking for her with binoculars.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"A girl wearing a cap walks from the street, you know? That's Rinka."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I need a little more specific information. There are several girls with caps and I don't know which one she is......."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"You see, she's wearing glasses and a mask....... She's wearing a shirt and a long skirt."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"............ Ah, I found her. If you carefully look at, she indeed looks like Rin-chan. If Kazu-kun hadn't told me, I wouldn't have recognized her at all......."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">She certainly doesn't look like the usual Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">In a word, she's plain.</div><div class="calibre5">Her face is thoroughly concealed, yet her atmosphere is somehow reserved.</div><div class="calibre5">Probably her natural face is a little cuter, However, what I can only see is a normal girl who can be found anywhere.</div><div class="calibre5">But that's when you just rely on your eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">I can't compare it well, but something hid deep within that human atmosphere clearly belonged to Mizuki Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">Even in the current situation where there is crowded with people, I can recognize her just by a quick glance.</div><div class="calibre5">"You're here early, yes, Kazuto-kun....... too early, I think." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">As I sit on the bench, Rinka walks up to me and says, somewhat a bit dejectedly.</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't think you can say that about others. Rinka is here early too." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I was planning to come first and enjoy the time waiting for Kazuto-kun. But I never thought I was overtaken ......... After all, we sync each other." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's voice is a little fluttery.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that Kurumizaka-san's plan is a success.</div><div class="calibre5">She sits down next to me and speaks quietly to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Did you notice me right away?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah I did. When you came out of the corner." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"'...... That's amazing, Kazuto-kun. I was confident that no one would recognize me in this outfit, though." (Rinka) <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> Sasuga her dear husband...)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">Rinka looks down at her outfit.</div><div class="calibre5">In fact, even her best friend, Kurumizaka-san, hadn't been able to see through her disguise.</div><div class="calibre5">It is the same for the people around her.</div><div class="calibre5">There is no one to make a fuss about <i class="calibre6">"It's Mizuki&nbsp;</i><i class="calibre6">Rinka</i><i class="calibre6">!"</i> and passing her without even has a glance.</div>

<div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Is it that the people are too dull to notice a change in clothing and atmosphere, or is it that Rinka is incredible at changing the atmosphere......?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I don't really know either.</div><div class="calibre5">As I'm conversing with Rinka in a natural flow, I unexpectedly hear a sound from my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre5">I excuse myself to Rinka and check it.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a message from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">The content is short, <b class="calibre7">[Compliment her on her outfit]</b>.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">...... Is it okay to compliment a disguise?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I can understand if it's a compliment to a fancy outfit, but.......</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I really don't know how to compliment it in the first place.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Please give me more detailed guidance on that, Guru Kurumizaka.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"What's wrong, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka asks me, curiously tilting her head.</div><div class="calibre5">Most of her face is hidden by her glasses and mask, but her gestures and voice are so cute.</div><div class="calibre5">She has a different kind of charm than usual.</div><div class="calibre5">I think I'll just go ahead and say what I'm thinking.</div><div class="calibre5">"Today's Rinka has a different atmosphere than usual, doesn't she?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yep I do. Personally, I wanted to meet Kazuto-kun in more fashionable clothes, but ... As I thought, this's weird, isn't this?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, not at all. You have a different charm from your usual cool atmosphere. It's very cute." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......." (Rinka)</div>

<div class="calibre5">I try to speak my mind frankly and honestly.</div><div class="calibre5">Then Rinka turns her head away from me and looks down.</div><div class="calibre5">Her cheeks are red.</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, ............. There's something different about you today as well, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eerm, he looks calm. I believe it's better to say he's becoming more confident." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I won't deny that.</div><div class="calibre5">Since I decided to face my feelings and Rinka a few days ago, my heart has been strangely filled with contentment.</div><div class="calibre5">At the very least, I've been recognized by Rinka in a game where heart-to-heart communication is very important to her.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">So, don't be afraid to let out your honest feelings, me.</i></div><div class="calibre5">It took me almost a month to finally reach this point.</div><div class="calibre5">While I'm smiling at Rinka, who is strangely nervous and fidgety, I receive another message from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">The content of the message is――――<b class="calibre7">[Kiss her]</b>.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">That's impossible!</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I mean, more like, it's all about the steps and all that stuff, then above all, the atmosphere! it is a very important point to pay attention to!</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Kissing her the moment you meet her on the first date is just too bad, you know.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What on earth are you referring to when you send me such advice, Kurumizaka-san?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, Kazuto-kun. It's time to go to......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, sure you're right. Let's get going." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">We get up from the bench together.</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly, Rinka pulls my sleeve.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mm, what's wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That is...... we're a married couple who got married in the game, aren't we?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, sure we are." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Except in real life, though (planned to be a lover).</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Holding hands, I wonder if it's good enough." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, if Kazuto-kun doesn't want to, that's fine――――." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm fine." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't wait for Rinka to say any further, then I immediately hold her hand.<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8"> (<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> L-L-LE-LEWDNESS OVERLOAD!!!)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">This is the first time I've touched Rinka's hand in all the years we've been interacting.</div><div class="calibre5">"――――Ka-Kazuto-kun!?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's eyes widen and her face turns red in surprise.</div><div class="calibre5">She is no longer even a glimpse of a cool person.</div><div class="calibre5">Her reaction is cute and innocent, even a little juvenile.</div><div class="calibre5">The very before my eyes is not a cool idol, rather, the real Mizuki Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mm, what is wrong? Is it not good to hold hands?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, I don't say it's not good...... Kazuto-kun, what happened to you, actually?....... Normally, you'll refuse by saying, <i class="calibre6">'In real life, we're not a couple, let alone dating'</i>......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">That absolutely sounds like a line I'll say.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Are you by any chance a fake Kazuto-kun? No, this atmosphere,...... <i class="calibre6"><b class="calibre7">sniff sniff</b></i>, and this smell also belong to the real Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka brings her nose closer and sniffs me just like a dog.</div><div class="calibre5">You're able to identify people by their smell, huh......!</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's hang out for a while, and then have lunch together." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yes......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">She seems to be really taken aback and nods at me with a slightly downcast look in her eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">Even though she's acting like she's my wife in real life, but she seems to be embarrassed when I approach her.</div><div class="calibre5">I've always been swayed by Rinka, but since it's our first date, I think I'll take the initiative today.</div>
