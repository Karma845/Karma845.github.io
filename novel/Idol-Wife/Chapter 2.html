<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; The Bell Pepper's and Probabilities are Astounding</h3>

<div>The classroom in the morning is noisy with students chatting and laughing.</div><div>I was still nervous as I sit alone in my seat.</div><div>My heart had been pounding since last night.</div><div>Thanks to this, I couldn't eat my breakfast properly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Sitting at the very back seat of the row by the window, I looked around at the entire classroom.</div><div>There were girls sitting next to each other chatting happily, and a group of boys from the athletic club.......</div><div>And there were also some flashy girls who were making a lot of noise.</div><div>Of course, I perfectly could see the back of Mizuki-san sitting in the front seat.</div><div><br /></div><div>I took out my smartphone from my pants pocket.</div><div>And launched the voice chat application for the game.</div><div>I hadn't received any messages from Rin...... no, from Mizuki-san.</div><div>I wanted to send her a chat, but I couldn't think of what to write.</div><div>I wanted to get a chat from her, anything is fine.</div><div><br /></div><div>With that in mind, I looked at Mizuki-san's back.</div><div>She was sitting with a beautiful posture like a model, reading a book without caring about the hustle and bustle around her.</div><div><i>What kind of book is it?</i> I wondered.</div><div>It's a selfish image, but I have a feeling that Mizuki prefers difficult stories written by foreign authors.</div><div>By the way, I love light novels with completely hard stories.</div><div>In particular, I had recently become addicted to web novels.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...Mizuki-san." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Just looking at her back was soothing.</div><div>I still couldn't believe that I've been playing games with Mizuki-san.</div><div>It's been since middle school.......</div><div><br /></div><div>As I leaned my elbows on the desk and stared at Mizuki-san, she suddenly looked back.</div><div>Our eyes met.</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>My heart jumped with a thump.</div><div>My body froze at the suddenness of the situation.</div><div><br /></div><div>The next moment, Mizuki-san waved her right hand in a small wave with no expression.</div><div>I immediately waved back.</div><div>Perhaps satisfied with that, Mizuki-san turned forward again and resumed reading.</div><div><br /></div><div>"O-oh man...!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div>

<p>I can't even begin to describe how impressed I am.</p><div>I waved my own hand to a popular idol, to Mizuki Rinka!</div><div>And we even made eye contact!</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked at the students around me.</div><div>No one seemed to have noticed the exchange between the two of us.</div><div>If they had noticed, there would have been a bit of a commotion.</div><div>After all, Mizuki-san is an idol who is rumored to hate men.</div><div>They would be heavily astonished to find out that she was interacting with such a dull boy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"... Rin is really really Mizuki-san, huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I revise again the fact that was confirmed as of yesterday.</div><div>So such a miracle is, actually exists.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9633;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The fourth hour was over and now was the lunch break.</div><div>The students of the cafeteria group got up and left the classroom.</div><div><br /></div><div>The remaining students were divided into two groups: those who were sharing desks with their friends, and those who were quietly unfolding their lunches in their seats.</div><div>I belong to the lunchbox group, but this time I had an appointment.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sup, Ayanokouji. Let's eat together."</div><div>"Hey, Ayanokouji-kun. I'm here again today."</div><div><br /></div><div>Just as I was about to get up from my seat, two boys came over.</div><div>One was a chubby boy and the other was a smart-looking boy with glasses.</div><div><br /></div><div>The chubby one is Tachibana, and the one with glasses is Saito.</div><div>The three of us usually spend our break time together.</div><div>We're familiar with each other.</div><div>I put my hands together and apologized to them.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Sorry. I have an appointment today." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Huh? What are you talking about? Is there anyone else you can spend your lunch break with? There's none, am I right?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"I don't like the way you said that....... Well, it's true, though." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Ayanokouji-kun, please don't waste the time by saying strange things. According to my calculations, the lunch break is only 40 minutes. Why don't we finish our meal quickly and discuss this month's light novels?" (Saito)</div><div><br /></div><div>Saito said as he raised his glasses.</div><div>......Whatever, but you don't even need to calculate to know that lunch break is 40 minutes.</div><div>Rather, <i>what exactly did you calculate?</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"I'm serious you know, I have an appointment. So I'll be off." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Wait a minute." (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana grabbed me by the arm.</div><div>I turned around wondering why, Then Tachibana asked me in a small voice.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You're not......with a girl by any chance, are you?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"......." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Hey, Ayanokouji?" (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>I shut my mouth because of the strange power of his threat.</div><div>Although Tachibana is chubby and short, his eyesight is surprisingly strong.</div><div>So I was a little overwhelmed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Wait, Tachibana-kun. According to my calculations, the probability of Ayanokouji-kun having a female friend is only 0.4%. There's no need to ask." (Saito)</div><div>"What, that's too low! Even having a mere female friend is hopeless......!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Can you give me 10% at least?</div><div>There's still a reasonable chance for me to make a female friend, aren't there.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Then who you made the promise with?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"......with Mizuki-san." (Kazuto)</div><div><br />

</div><div>I muttered to myself in a shrinking voice.</div><div>Then Tachibana and Saito looked at each other and laughed happily.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hahahaha! What are you trying to say, Ayanokouji! You and Mizuki are going to spend lunch together?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Well, that is, right. I was invited to the cafeteria." (Kazuto)</div><div>"That's not possible! Don't be so delusional!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"That's right, Ayanokouji-kun. According to my calculations, the probability of you being asked out by Mizuki-san is astronomical." (Saito)</div><div>"What the h*ll do you mean by that astronomical thing? Don't make it sound so clever." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>He laughed so loudly making fun of me, and it was just plain annoying.</div><div><i>Should I slap him?</i></div><div><br /></div><div>"Hahahaha! You've made me laugh, Ayanokouji. I'll give you one of my bell peppers as a thank you." (Tachibana)</div><div>"No thanks. Eat it yourself." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Calm down, Ayanokouji-kun, Calm down. Here,&nbsp; I'll give you an eggplant." (Saito)</div><div>"Oh, really? Thank you&#8213;&#8213;there's no way I'll say that! You're just forcing a food you don't like on me, guys." (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>These assholes.......!</div><div>But, understandably, they can't believe it.</div><div>I'm myself even not sure I believe it either.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Do you have a minute?"&nbsp;</div><div>"Eh&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I turned around when someone called out to me from behind.</div><div>And it was Mizuki-san.</div><div>She was standing behind me with a blank expression on her face that some people might take her as cold-hearted.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kazuto-kun. You haven't forgotten the appointment with me, have you?" (Rinka)</div><div>"N-no, I haven't forgotten. I was just about to go." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Really. I'm glad. Then let's go to the cafeteria as soon as possible. It will get crowded if we stay here too long." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>After saying that, Mizuki-san turned her back on us and walked to the exit of the classroom.</div><div>As expected of a cool idol.</div><div>From the way she spoke to the way she walked, she was so magnificent.</div><div><br />
</div><div>"H-he-hey.... Ayanokouji....?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"N-no way....... My calculations are......." (Saito)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana and Saito, who were watching our exchange, were gaping their mouths like goldfish.</div><div>Those were very dumb faces.</div><div><br /></div><div>"E-ermm. That's why, I'm.......off." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Ayanokouji! What kind of magic trick did you use? An online game nerd like you, there's absolutely no way you can go having lunch with an idol, right!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"According to my calculations, it's going to rain meteorites tomorrow." (Saito)</div><div>".....You guys, you'll have to remember that later." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I've been told a lot of terrible things.</div><div>And please stop calling me an online game nerd.</div><div>Even though I intend to keep it in the realm of a hobby.</div><div><br /></div><div>The next thing I knew, I had been attracting attention not only from them, but also from the remaining students in the classroom.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>......This is really annoying. I hate to stand out.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>I chased after Mizuki-san as if to escape.</div>
