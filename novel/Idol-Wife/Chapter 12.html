<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Fortune Telling is...</h3>

<div class="calibre5">Lunch break. After finishing my meal, I went to the back of the school building.</div><div class="calibre5">Saito and Tachibana asked me where I was going, but I deceived them appropriately.</div><div class="calibre5">"My, Kazuto-kun. I'm glad you came." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Hello." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san, who had arrived before me, smiled thinly at me.</div><div class="calibre5">I responded, feeling a little embarrassed as I averted my gaze.</div><div class="calibre5">Nevertheless, the air in the back of the school building is nice and fresh.</div><div class="calibre5">Just standing there, the soft breeze caressed my whole body.</div><div class="calibre5">Even so, there were few people around, so no one could see us.</div><div class="calibre5">Isn't this a perfect place for a secret meeting?</div><div class="calibre5">"It's about this morning..." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I don't even know about that either. I was suddenly asked to choose a finger. Well, Himekawa-san's friend was watching with a grin, so it was probably just a prank." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"...you don't you know about that?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I asked back with a question.</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san put her hand on her chin and made a face of thinking.</div><div class="calibre5">"I see, it's okay. If you don't know that, it might be convenient." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Huuh...?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She interpreted it in her own way and convinced herself in her own way.</div><div class="calibre5">What the h*ll is going on here?</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, that's right..... Then, how about you choose my finger this time?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">As she said that, Mizuki-san pointed her beautiful, thin, feminine fingers at me.</div><div class="calibre5">"What's the point of this, really? Somehow, it's kind of creepy......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"You don't have to think too much about it, it's just no big deal, a little fortune-telling. Just go with your intuition and pick my finger." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"...Perhaps, you're saying that you'll touch Himekawa-san's finger but won't touch mine?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san asked me somewhat anxiously.</div><div class="calibre5">I hurriedly shook my head.</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-that's not the case." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I was even more nervous than I was with Himekawa-san.</div><div class="calibre5">The psychological burden of holding the finger of an ordinary classmate and that of a popular idol was incredibly different.</div><div class="calibre5">"This is my advice to you, but I suggest you choose the ring finger." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"The ring finger?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed that depending on the finger you chose, the meaning would be different.</div><div class="calibre5">I pretended to choose her middle finger.</div><div class="calibre5">"...!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san bent her eyebrows slightly and her face became tense.</div><div class="calibre5">Her face even changed to that of someone who is about to cry.</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, Mizuki-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun. Though, I do believe in you....." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">She gave me a strange feeling of tension and a desperate craving.</div><div class="calibre5">Though, she said it was no big deal fortune-telling before.......</div><div class="calibre5">I'm sure I've heard of it, that girls do tend to love spiritual(?) things.</div><div class="calibre5">I read on an online dating forum that many guys were dumped by their girlfriends because they were incompatible through fortune-telling.</div><div class="calibre5">It was such a horrible story.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Will Mizuki-san hate me too if I choose the middle finger?</i></div><div class="calibre5">As I was thinking about this, I unconsciously gently picked her ring finger.</div><div class="calibre5">At that moment, Mizuki-san smiled as if she was a flower blossomed with a poof.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">――――Eeh?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"I did it!...... Ahem. No, I should say that this result is natural. Since we've been married for years, so we didn't need to confirm it by fortune-telling, yes." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki cleared her throat and returned to her normal cool mode, but she spoke quickly.</div><div class="calibre5">It was unusual to see her like that, but the smile she had just shown me had left a strong impression.</div><div class="calibre5">She was known as a cool beautiful girl idol by the public, and a neat cold-blooded doll by some haters...</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't expect her to have such a defenseless smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">Somehow, it was reminiscent of Rin in the online game.</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't know what this fortune-telling thing means, but I'm glad Mizuki-san is happy about it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's not like I'm happy. I was just simply confirming a fact." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you going to be a 'tsun' here.....?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san said with a crisp expression.</div><div class="calibre5">For better or worse, she was her normal self.</div><div class="calibre5">"There's a lot more I want to tell you, but if it's too late we might get some suspicion." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I guess so. Tachibana and Saito were also suspicious." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Real-world is still inconvenient, yes. It's hard to just talk to someone you love." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">My heart bounced when she was said such words very naturally.</div><div class="calibre5">From Mizuki-san's point of view, it probably natural enough to say it.</div><div class="calibre5">"But it's exciting in its own way." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Exciting?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. Stealing a moment from the public eyes and exchanging a few words with the person you love in a small amount of time. It's like an old-fashioned love story, isn't it?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I guess so....?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I gave her a vague answer.</div><div class="calibre5">I was too embarrassed to keep up the conversation.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll go back to class first." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"O-okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">".....I wonder if it would be fun to meet up somewhere else next time." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">While muttering such a thing, Mizuki-san turned her back and left.</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The back of the school building had become quiet.</div><div class="calibre5">The only sound that reached my ears was the pleasant sound of the wind.</div><div class="calibre5">"I think I'll stay here a little longer." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed that it would take a while for the burning in my cheeks to subside.</div><div class="calibre5">"...Mizuki-san's innocent smile, huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">When it comes to the "Rin" in the game, I understand her so deeply that there is no room for doubt about her personal nature.</div><div class="calibre5">However, I probably still have no understanding of the inner workings of "Mizuki Rinka", who acts as a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre5">"I wonder if something will change if we play online games together tomorrow." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I'll be able to call her Rinka.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Then I can finally take my first step in real life.</i></div><div class="calibre5">Somehow, that was what I thought.</div>
