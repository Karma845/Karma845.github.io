<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; The Cool Idol who Hates Men</h3>

<div>A few days had already passed since I found out that Rin's real identity was Mizuki-san.</div><div>The next thing I knew, it was already Thursday.</div><div>The day after tomorrow, the three of us, including Kurumizaka-san, were going to play an online game.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey hey, Ayanokouji. Cheer up, will ya?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"He's right, Ayanokouji-kun. You should thank God that you were able to go to the cafeteria with Mizuki-san even if it was just once." (Saito)</div><div>"... I'm not depressed, though." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>It was lunch break, and the classroom was filled with a peaceful atmosphere.</div><div>I was having lunch with my two friends as usual.</div><div>I hadn't talked to Mizuki-san in the school since that Monday.</div><div>The reason was that a little rumor spread in the school after Mizuki-san and I went to the cafeteria together.</div><div><br /></div><div>Considering her idol activity, it would be better not to get involved in public anymore.</div><div>In the end, we had only spent one lunch break together.</div><div><br /></div><div>"So Ayanokouji's popularity period is only so far huh?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Popularity period eh..... I've told you guys, it's just that my friend was a popular idol, haven't I?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Even so, it's still a pretty amazing story." (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana said while biting yakisoba bread.</div><div>......DÎ±mn, this guy spilled his yakisoba on my desk.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But you were chatting with Mizuki-san during breaks, right?" (Saito)</div><div>"Well, it's true." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>As Saito said, during lunch break, I was having a nice conversation with Mizuki-san via my smartphone.</div><div>By the way, Mizuki's tones were that of Rin.</div><div><i>Does she naturally change her character in text chat?</i></div><div><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id.)"~</i></div><div>"Well, there, Ayanokouji." (Tachibana)</div><div>"What's that, Tachibana. Next time you spill food on my desk, I'll get angry." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Don't worry, I'll lick it off." (Tachibana)</div><div>"If you do that, I'll seriously beat you down, okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I felt sick imagining Tachibana licking my desk.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haha, I'm kidding. Why Ayanokouji didn't call Mizuki by her given name?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"W-why the h*ll did you suddenly ask me that? I don't have the courage to do that, you know?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"But Mizuki calls you Kazuto-kun, right?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Well... yeah" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I think about it, she called me by my given name from the beginning, right?</div><div>I thought it was due to Mizuki-san's personality, but.......</div><div><br />
  
</div><div>"It's not normal for that Mizuki to call a man by name, you know." (Tachibana)</div><div>"Is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Yeah, this is a story I heard half a year ago.... I heard a handsome guy called Mizuki by her given name when he was trying to approach her." (Tachibana)</div><div>"Hee, and then?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>"I heard he was treated coldly.." (Tachibana)</div><div>"... that's a scene that comes to mind." (Kazuto)</div><div>"But do you know what did that handsome guy misunderstand? He misunderstood that Mizuki was telephoning and lightheartedly hugged her from behind." (Tachibana)</div><div>"T-then?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"She threw him on his back and knocked him to the floor.....!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"O-oh man...!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, as far as I can tell, that guy was the worst.</div><div>It's great sexual harassment if you call someone by their name out of the blue and then hug them from behind.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Fortunately, the handsome guy only suffered bruises, but ... Mizuki's dislike of men proved to be considerable." (Tachibana)</div><div>"It's not that she hates men, it's just self-defense, right?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"But, such Mizuki was calling Ayanokouji by his given name?" (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Ignoring my words, Tachibana continued the conversation.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...So, what are you trying to say?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"That's you, that thing." (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana said with an air of mystery.</div><div>Saito also smirked following him.</div><div><br /></div><div>"According to my calculation, the probability that Mizuki-san is in love with Ayanokouji-kun is 84%!" (Saito)</div><div>"Huuhh!? W-w-wh-what are you talking about!?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Saito told me with so much confidence that I couldn't help but got up from my chair and shouted.</div><div>At that moment, I felt eyes on me from all over the classroom.</div><div><br /></div><div>"......" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>My face was so hot that it was almost boiling.</div><div>I hurriedly sat back in my chair.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Pfffft! Ayanokouji-kun, you're getting impatient." (Saito)</div><div>"I-It's because you say strange things! T-that someone like Mizuki-san is in love with me ...!" (Kazuto)</div><div>"No, Ayanokouji-kun, I think it's quite possible." (Saito)</div><div>"No, it's not. I and Mizuki-san are just online game friends. Nothing more, nothing less." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Is that so? I've been observing Mizuki-san lately, and she seemed to be rather interested in Ayanokoji-kun." (Saito)</div><div>"Again, doing something inappropriate..." (Kazuto)</div><div style="text-align: left;"><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id.)"~</i></div><div>I said in astonishement and reached for the white rice in my lunch box with my chopsticks.</div><div><i>Ah, shoot, my hands are trembling and I can't grab the white rice...!</i></div><div>I still hadn't gotten over my upset!</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ayanokouji-kun doesn't seem to be aware of it, but Mizuki-san is watching Ayanokoji-kun every chance she gets." (Saito)</div><div>"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen it too." (Tachibana)</div><div>"......N-no way." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>That popular idol, Mizuki Rinka, is in love with me, who is called the online game nerd...?</i></div><div>It was not a very believable story.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What would you do if I said that?" (Saito)</div><div>"It is a lie! I was a little happy, though!" (Kazuto)</div><div>"No, it's the truth." (Saito)</div><div>"What the h*ll is that..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>That was not good. I was being toyed by Saito and Tachibana.</div><div>I would take a deep breath and tried to regain my normal mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>"If you are so suspicious, why don't you call Mizuki by her name?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"...If she ignores or throws me, I'll never be able to recover." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Hey Saito. How much is the probability that Ayanokouji's name-calling challenge will succeed?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"According to my calculations, it's about 70%." (Saito)</div><div>"It's a probability I'm afraid to try. And it's even lower than the probability of she's in love with me." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Saito's calculations continued to make no sense to me.</div><div>I gave Saito a half-hearted grin and took a piece of his omelet into my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>&#8213;&#8213;Ouch. I bit my tongue.</i></div><div><br /></div><div><i>Mizuki-san is having crush on me.</i></div><div>I was imagining such a fairytale-like development, and my mind was in turmoil.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, are you Ayakoji Kazuto-kun?"</div><div>"Ee----?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I turned my head to the side as someone called out to me.</div><div>An unfamiliar female student was standing there.</div><div>She was not a classmate.</div><div>But from the color of her scarf, I could confirm that she was in the same grade.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Can you go out with me for a moment?"</div><div>"Umm, I'm in the middle of eating..." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Ah, I'm sorry, give it up. I'm in trouble if it's not right now."</div><div><br /></div><div>She did not withdraw her request, even though she bowed her head apologetically.</div><div>She had a gentle atmosphere, but she didn't seem to have any intention of giving me a veto.</div><div><br /></div><div>"H-hey hey hey...! I knew it, Ayanokouji is going to be popular...!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"I-it's not like that. And I have a boyfriend."</div><div><br /></div><div>While Tachibana shuddered exaggeratedly, the girl said it as if it was natural.</div><div>I put down my chopsticks and asked her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I don't mind, but can you tell me what your business is?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"I can't say it out loud, but Nana-chan is calling you."</div><div>"Kurumizaka-san is?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What kind of business is it?</i> I wondered.</div><div>Anyway, if Kurumizaka-san is the other party, I couldn't just ignore her.</div><div>I quickly put my lunch away and stood up.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Then let's go there." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Okay."</div><div><br /></div><div>When I tried to follow her, Tachibana and Saito opened their eyes wide and showed surprise on their faces.</div><div><br /></div><div>"N-no way, After Mizuki, now is Nana-chan!? You, you are a monster...!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"A-according to my calculations, the probability of Ayanokouji-kun being popular is......100%!" (Saito)</div><div><br /></div><div>.......</div><div>What are you saying, these people.</div><div>I walked out of the classroom, feeling their eyes on my back.</div><div><br /></div>
