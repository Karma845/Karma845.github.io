<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Attack of Bell Pepper and Probability</h3>

<div>The day passed by peacefully, somehow.</div><div>After the classes ended, the students rushed out of the classroom.</div><div>They were probably busy with club activities or going out with friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>I, who had nothing of interest to do, sat in my seat in a relaxed manner.</div><div>I looked at Mizuki-san's back with a vague feeling.</div><div>Mizuki-san waved lightly at me as she left the classroom.</div><div>I tried to resist the urge to grin and waved back.</div><div>After that, Mizuki-san left with Kurumizaka-san, who had come to pick her up in the hallway.</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn't know the details, but I guess they're going to idol activities.</div><div>They may practice singing and dancing, or they may work hard on some kind of recording......</div><div>I wonder what kind of day student idols spend.</div><div>I'm starting to wonder about things I hadn't paid attention to before.</div><div>I want to know a little more about Mizuki-san.</div><div>She didn't want to touch on real-life topics, though.</div><div>I guess I'll just have to put up with this.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was sitting in a daze on the chair for a while, but as I got up about to leave.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ayanokouji-kuuu~n......! Where do you think you're going?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"According to my calculations, the probabilities of you escaping from us are 0%." (Saito)</div><div>"......you guys." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana spread his arms out to block the way.</div><div>And Saito, he was even holding my bag.</div><div>These guys were deadly serious.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I-i-it can't be, you're not going to spend ...... private time with Mizuki Rinka, are you?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"I'm not. I'm just going to go home and play online games." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Really!? Is it true!?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Of course." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>...... Let's not talk about what happened in the cafeteria.</div><div>I didn't know what these two would do if they knew that Kurumizaka-san was also get involved.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well well, calm down, Tachibana-kun. Ayanokouji-kun, you should also sit down." (Saito)</div><div>"No, I want to go home." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Sit down now... before my glasses catch fire." (Saito)</div>

<div>"..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I reluctantly sat down after being threatened incomprehensibly.</div><div>I really didn't understand why.</div><div>It was probably just me, but I'd like to see his glasses catch fire.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Let's get straight, Ayanokouji. I want you to tell me everything here." (Tachibana)</div><div>"What you want me to tell?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"It's obvious, isn't it! It's about how you became close with Mizuki!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Aah....." (Kazuto)</div><div>"And I heard you even talked with Nana-chan at the cafeteria! You fÕ½cking extravagant bastard!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Speaking of extravagant, isn't it belong to your body." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I said while looking at Tachibana's fat belly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What you say, Dumbass!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Pffft! That's a perfect counter-attack score according to my calculations! ....Pfffftt." (Saito)</div><div>"Saito too...! Enough about my body shape! We're talking with Ayanokouji now! How did you become close with Mizuki?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"More than that, Mizuki-san calls you by surname, but Kurumizaka-san calls you by given name." (Saito) <span style="color: #800180;"><i>(</i><b style="font-style: italic;">PTW/N</b><i>: "Mizuki calls by myouji[surname], but Kurumizaka calls by namae[name/given name]"; Didn't Rinka call him by given name, and Nana by nickname? </i>ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”<i>)</i></span></div><div><br /></div><div>"Yeah, it doesn't match their images, does it? Mizuki isn't a type that so casually calls someone by name..... And Nana-chan should have a sense of intimacy." (Tachibana)</div><div>"I can kind of understand that feeling. Well, that's why......" (Kazuto)</div><div>"You're not very good at diverting the topic, are you? Just tell to me." (Tachibana)</div><div>"Hmm......" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What should I do?</i></div><div><i>If the fact Mizuki-san is an online gamer being known... Then, isn't the public will be heavily shocked?</i></div><div>I don't mean to belittle the game, but it's an image that doesn't fit Mizuki-san at all.</div><div>It may be too much to say that her character will be ruined.</div><div>Even so, it's not a good thing to be known.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey Ayanokouji! Hurry up and tell me, or I won't give you bell peppers from now on!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"I don't like bell peppers. I don't hate them, but I don't like them." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Okay! Then I'll give you 1000 yen, so tell me!" (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana and Saito put their hands together and begged.</div><div>They're so desperate that I can't stand them.......</div><div>If possible, I would like to ignore them.</div><div>But if I don't say anything, they might make a fuss over it.</div><div>I made a decision with sorrow heart.</div><div><br /></div><div>"... Don't tell anyone, okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"I know! We're friends, remember? We will definitely keep our promise!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"According to my calculations, we have a 2000% chance of keeping our words!" (Saito)</div><div>"It all smells like a lie..... I met Mizuki-san through an online game." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Really? How did that happen?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"The story is....... Two years ago, I got married to Mizuki-san on an online game." (Kazuto)</div><div>""S-seriously!?"" (Tachibana, Saito)</div><div><br /></div><div>Both of them were surprised harmoniously.</div><div>Well, it's a normal reaction.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey Saito! What's the probability that one's wife in a game is a popular idol?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"Well, according to my calculations, it's about 30%." (Saito)</div><div>"That's pretty high!" (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Tachibana and Saito made a lot of noise.</div><div>The classmates who were still in the classroom looked at us, wondering what was going on.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey you guys, don't make a fuss. If the others find out about this, we'll be in serious trouble." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Huh? What's the trouble about?" (Tachibana)</div><div>"It'll affect Mizuki-san's image. And maybe, Mizuki-san will stop playing game if the public finds out about her hobby." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was not sure, though.</div><div>I hadn't heard anything about it from her.</div><div>It was just a hunch I had as a long-time friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>"... I think it might be. According to my calculations, there's a 99% chance that Mizuki-san's gaming hobby will cause a public stir. And a lot of people will start playing games to meet Mizuki in the game. It will definitely cause a grand commotion." (Saito)</div><div><br /></div><div>Whether it was a calculation or a prediction, but I think it's quite accurate.</div><div>At least it will definitely affect Mizuki's mental health.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That's why, can you please not tell anyone about this?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"..."</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn't know what they were thinking, but they kept their mouths shut and didn't say anything.</div><div>I was a little frustrated, so I continued my words.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I want to protect Mizuki-san's place. It's my selfish guess, but I think that the online game world is......the only world where she can play without worrying about the eyes around her. Please, don't tell anyone." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I appealed to them with a seriousness that is unlike me.</div><div>The two looked at each other and put their hands on my shoulders.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ayanokouji....... There's nothing to worry about. Your feelings have been fully conveyed to me.." (Tachibana)</div><div>"Tachibana......." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Is this the power of friendship?</i></div><div>Tachibana, who had a sincere atmosphere, was looking straight at my eyes.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;So I'll let you have my bell peppers." (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

<div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"We're a friend, but I'll tell you. You'll taste some tasty pain, you know." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>How can you blurt out a cringey joke like that to a friend who has been talking so seriously?</i></div><div>I felt the urge to kill him as if it was normal.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hahaha! I'm kidding, Ayanokouji! As for Mizuki's case, it's a secret between just the three of us!" (Tachibana)</div><div>"..." (Kazuto)</div><div>"I'm really sorry. I'm scared when Ayanokouji, who is usually quiet, glares at me." (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>I gave Tachibana a look that was filled with murderous intent.</div><div>Tachibana's mouth twitched and he hid behind Saito.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Well well, Ayanokouji-kun. This is Tachibana-kun after all, so let's forgive him. Ah, of course, I'll keep my promise as well, so don't worry." (Saito)</div><div>"Haa~... Okay then." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>It's no use getting angry over it.</div><div>And I understand that they are not the kind of people who break their promises.</div><div>That's why I decided to tell them.</div><div><br /></div><div><i><b>*Ping*</b></i>. A notification sounded from my smartphone.</div><div><br /></div><div>I took it out of my pants pocket and checked the contents.</div><div>The sender is Rin.</div><div><i>[Would you like to play a game for a while tonight?]</i> It was what was written there.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Heee..."</div><div><br /></div><div>Saito and Tachibana peeked into my smartphone from the side.</div><div><br /></div><div>"W-what is it?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Can we go too?" (Saito)</div><div>"Obviously the answer is a NO. Mizuki-san maybe is innocent in the game, but she's a shy person in reality.... She's wary of everyone except those she's been allowed." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, I've never seen her be friendly with anyone other than me.</div><div>Mizuki-san's social relationships in the online game can be described as somewhat exclusive.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Somehow she's kind of like a cat..... Well, if Ayanokouji-kun says so, it can't be helped then. We'll shut our mouths." (Saito)</div><div>"That's right. I think I'll go back to playing online games for a while. I might even be able to marry an idol!" (Tachibana)</div><div><br /></div><div>The two talked to each other in a relaxed atmosphere.</div><div>With this, Mizuki-san's case seemed to be settled.</div><div><br /></div><div>While I was hearing their conversation, I replied to Rin, <i>[Okay, I'll be there around 9 pm.]</i></div><div><br /></div><div>While I was looking forward to tonight, my heart was racing with uncontrollable nervousness.</div><div><br /></div>
