<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Determination</h3>

<div class="calibre5">After about thirty minutes of running through the city at night, I go home drenched in sweat, take a shower, and go up to my room.</div><div class="calibre5">I've done some muscle training before my run, so my stamina is pretty tough.</div><div class="calibre5">Though, it's just a little tough for a guy like me, who is known as a <i class="calibre6">"Nerd Gamer"</i>.</div><div class="calibre5">"I guess I'll get used to it if I keep at it every day." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">Continuity is the key.</span></div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps it's because I'm being aware of the popular idols, I'm becoming hungry for some kind of efforts.</div><div class="calibre5">After taking a short break, I turn on my computer and sit down on the chair.</div><div class="calibre5">Then I search for <i class="calibre6">"high schooler date plans"</i>.</div><div class="calibre5">A list of sites with recommendations for places to go on dates and what to wear is displayed.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">.......I don't know where I should to start.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I look at them in order from the top, but all I can think is, <i class="calibre6">"Heeh, I see, so that's it,"</i> but I can't really grasp it.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I, Am I really okay?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I stare at the computer screen for a few minutes.</div><div class="calibre5">I have an image of what should to do on the date.</div><div class="calibre5">The only thing left to do is to do some image training.ã€€</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Should I, confess my feelings to her?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre11">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id. so, read only on my site)"~</i></div><div class="calibre5">It's something I've been thinking about for a long time.</div><div class="calibre5">It'll not be good for my health to continue our current relationship.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Am I now really worthy for Mizuki Rinka?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I've been thinking about that a lot.</div><div class="calibre5">"But, it's different......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka has repeatedly said that she loves me as I am.</div><div class="calibre5">Then, I should take that feeling seriously and make a move on her.</div><div class="calibre5">"That's a good opportunity." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">At the end of the date, I'll confess my feelings to her.......</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Ooh, somehow it's kinda nice.</i></div><div class="calibre5">We've been together for a few years in a game, then I'm going to confess on our first date in real life.</div><div class="calibre5">Thinking that way, I'm starting to feel it romantic.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, there may be many other problems.</div><div class="calibre5">But I'll take the next date as a new step and confess to Rinka then become officially dating.</div><div class="calibre5">I have to stop being dithering.</div><div class="calibre5">I should be proud of myself for telling Rinka that I like her.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre11">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id. so, read only on my site)"~</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Okay......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Holding my smartphone in my hand, I send a chat to Kurumizaka-san with unwavering determination.</div><div class="calibre5">[I'm going to confess my feelings to Rinka at the end of our upcoming date.] (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">......There's no turning back now.</div><div class="calibre5">I've declared it to Rinka's best friend, so later an excuse like <i class="calibre6">"As I thought, It's impossible"</i> won't work.</div><div class="calibre5">"Now that I think about it, I just didn't feel confident in myself from the beginning." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I made a lot of excuses, but in the end, that was it.</div><div class="calibre5">The answer came a few weeks ago, when I started calling her 'Rinka'.</div><div class="calibre5">"I love Rin......<b class="calibre7"> I love&nbsp;Mizuki Rinka!</b>" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san, Kasumi-san, and above all, Rinka had affirmed me.</div><div class="calibre5">If that's the case, then I should just clash my feelings with her openly.</div><div class="calibre5">It would be disrespectful to them to deny myself.</div><div class="calibre5">After our upcoming date, our daily life will change again.</div>
