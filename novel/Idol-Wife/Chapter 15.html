<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Mizuki Nonoa</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"Hey, Kazuto-bro! this time, be a horse!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">――――she becomes attached to me very much.</div><div class="calibre5">It as if as fast as two panels comic.</div><div class="calibre5">At first, Nonoa-chan looked surprised, but she probably observed me and decided that I was not a dangerous person.</div><div class="calibre5">She started messing around with me as if she was checking my humanity.</div><div class="calibre5">I've always liked children, so I'd like to play with them.</div><div class="calibre5">"Horsey, horsey!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, yes. Hold on to me tight, okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She's so taken with me.</div><div class="calibre5">With Nonoa-chan on my back, I go around the room on all fours.</div><div class="calibre5">This is surprisingly fun, and troublesome as well.</div><div class="calibre5">"I was wondering what'd happen at first, but...... Kazuto-kun is actually good at dealing with children, yes." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I wonder about it. I'm just having fun with them, though....." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">There's also a fact that Nonoa-chan is unusually friendly.</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly I remembered the nostalgic memories of my middle school days.</div><div class="calibre5">When I went to a nursery school for school lessons, the children gathered around me.</div><div class="calibre5">The kid's snot was wiped to my uniform, boys kicked my leg, girls hugged me, etc...</div><div class="calibre5">It was really messy, but fun in its own way.</div><div class="calibre5">However, my classmate at that time laughed at me and saying, "<i class="calibre6">Ayanokouji's mental age is the same as that of a kid."</i></div><div class="calibre5">Then the night, I created a character using that of my classmate <i class="calibre6">(I registered it with just the first half of the last name for privacy reasons)</i> in the game and got killed on purpose by a small fry monster.</div><div class="calibre5">It was insidious, even for me.....</div><div class="calibre5">"Big bro, I want to have an arm swing this time!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, that. It's okay, but as an exchange, don't tell anyone I'm here, okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Okay!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan replied cheerfully on my back.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm back from a horse to a bipedal human, and I hang Nonoa-chan on my right arm and swing her gently.</div><div class="calibre5">She's much lighter than I expected.</div><div class="calibre5">"Amazing... Kazuto-kun, you have strength, yes." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Because Nonoa-chan is small, so if it just this much, I can afford........uh" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">While saying that, I swing her whole body and trying my best to do the arm swing.</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan is lighter than her age, but it's still a little tough for me as a nerd gamer and an indoor person.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm going to have sore muscles, for sure!</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahahaha! Big bro, you're amazing!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"R-right.....!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I suddenly catch my face reflected in the window.</div><div class="calibre5">Somehow I have a great expression.</div><div class="calibre5">□</div><div class="calibre5">"Now, I want to play online games!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, Nonoa. It's too early for you." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's not!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps Nonoa-chan has tired of playing with me as a plaything, now she demands to play online games.</div><div class="calibre5">"Nonoa, you're still in the first grade of elementary school, aren't you? At least when you reach middle school." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Not fair, it's only Rinka-sis! I want to play too!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"No means no." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Mmm~~~......Kazuto, big bro, please." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh, me?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The subject of the conversation suddenly changes.</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan turns her gaze at me expectantly.</div><div class="calibre5">"No, Kazuto-kun. It's too early for Nonoa." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Too early huh, I wonder if there's an age limit on online games.</div><div class="calibre5">No, it's not my place to interfere with the Mizuki family's way of thinking.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-bro...!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Little girl + upturned eyes + teary eyes = Angel.</div><div class="calibre5">The obvious answer comes out in my mind.</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka, shouldn't it be okay if it's just a little?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Haa~, you're too soft.........just a little, okay?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I did it! Thank you Rinka-sis!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka looks reluctant when she sees Nonoa-chan jumping up and down happily.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, surely it may not be good to get hooked on online games at this age.</div><div class="calibre5">But her little sister will inevitably be intrigued when she sees her sister playing games happily.</div><div class="calibre5">Rather than forcing her to endure it, I think it's better to let her experience it even just a little.......</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka starts up her computer and launches <b class="calibre7">Black Plains</b>.</div><div class="calibre5">She sits Nonoa-chan on the chair and opens the character creation menu.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems she's going to start playing from scratch.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm? Let's see..." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan's fiddling with her character's form with poor control.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka explains in a gentle tone from the side.</div><div class="calibre5">I could tell that the two sisters were close.</div><div class="calibre5">I sit down on Rinka's bed and watch their backs.</div><div class="calibre5">From the looks of them, it's going to take some time.</div><div class="calibre5">Eventually, after nearly thirty minutes, Nonoa's first character is completed.</div><div class="calibre5">She was a small girl wearing a black robe.</div><div class="calibre5">Her name is "Nonoa".</div><div class="calibre5">It's named "Nonoa" to resemble her real self.</div><div class="calibre5">"Look, look, big brother Kazuto! Is this girl cute?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, it's so cute." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ehehe." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">When I praise her, Nonoa-chan smiles with satisfaction.</div><div class="calibre5">Then the tutorial begins.</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, is this the button...to move?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, it is. Then if you press the space bar......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Does she have it hard with her first mouse-keyboard operation?</i></div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan is struggling to control the character on the screen.</div><div class="calibre5">When she manages to complete the walking mission, The Old Whitebeard, who is like a master in the game, says, <b class="calibre7">[Well done! It's amazing, Nonoa!]</b> He clapped his hands and praised her.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hehe, I was praised. Hey, Kazuto-bro, am I great?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, you're great!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She asks me happily, so I give her a head pat and praise her.</div><div class="calibre5">Children are really cute and innocent.</div><div class="calibre5">If it was me, <i class="calibre6">"Stop talking nonsense and get on with the tutorial. Why there's no skip button?"</i> or something like that.</div><div class="calibre5">"...Even I can do that too." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Eh? I heard something muttered.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Did I hear it wrong?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I stand behind Nonoa-chan and look at the screen without worrying about it.</div><div class="calibre5">This time the tutorial for fighting monsters begins.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a battle that I can definitely win, since the HP won't decrease even if being attacked.</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan makes an adorable voice saying, <i class="calibre6">"Ei, Ei,"</i> as she repeatedly fires fireballs at the monsters with poor control. Winning the game with plenty of time left(?).</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre7">[Hmm, as expected of you, Nonoa! It's amazing!]</b></div><div class="calibre5">"I did it! I'm amazing!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan, who made her eyes shine, pulls my sleeves to show off the praise she got.</div><div class="calibre5">"You're amazing, Nonoa-chan." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I gently pat Nonoa-chan's head.</div><div class="calibre5">She's really innocent and cute.</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre7"><i class="calibre6">O God, I really want a little sister from the bottom of my heart!</i></b></div><div class="calibre5"><img src="images/000008.png" class="calibre4" /></div><div class="calibre5">"I've never had Kazuto-kun praise me for something like that before." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...Umm, Rinka-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"What is it, yes?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you possibly, competing against your own sister?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not. I'm just talking to myself. Don't get the wrong idea." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka denies while maintaining her cool demeanor.</div><div class="calibre5">......What the heck is that.</div><div class="calibre5">While wondering, I continue to praise Nonoa-chan for an hour and a half while keeping an eye on her gameplay.</div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Nt16R8L/193544.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<div class="calibre5">During this time, I'd like to note that Rinka, who's next to me, was muttering things like, <i class="calibre6">"I'm pretty good for my first time, but is that really something to praise?"</i> or <i class="calibre6">"Even if it's for a child, isn't that a low standard of praise?"</i>.</div><div class="calibre5">"My eyes are getting dizzy. I'm sleepy." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Stopping the mouse, Nonoa-chan rubs her eyelids and murmurs.</div><div class="calibre5">"You've been playing the game a little too much. So your eyes are tired. Let's call it a day." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Mmkay. Kazuto-bro, carry me~." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">The sleepy Nonoa-chan throws her arms around me.</div><div class="calibre5">"You can't do that, Nonoa. Don't cause too much trouble for Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Mmm~. Carry~." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Cut it ....." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll be fine. Come here, Nonoa-chan." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">As if to restrain Rinka, who's beginning to speak harshly, I carry Nonoa-chan in my arms.</div><div class="calibre5">She's light and warm.</div><div class="calibre5">"Even though she's already in first grade....." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's normal. Even I was still begging my mother to carry me when I was in third grade." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"You're a spoiled kid, yes? ......Kazuto-kun when he was little eh......!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Hey hey, you had the look of a criminal for a second, are you okay?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I shift my consciousness from Rinka to Nonoa-chan.</div><div class="calibre5">Her eyes look so tired that she's about to fall asleep at any moment.</div><div class="calibre5">She had been fooling around with me before she started playing games.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that she had been playing with her friends before that......</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun, you like children, don't you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's right. I won't deny it. Do you hate them, Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I like them, because children have no ulterior motive." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">That's right.</div><div class="calibre5">Children don't think about the other person's looks or status at all.</div><div class="calibre5">There may be some exceptions, but basically, children are pure.</div><div class="calibre5">You can communicate with them in the same way that you can communicate in the game.</div><div class="calibre5">"Speaking of which, Rinka. It's already getting dark, are you sure you don't want me to go home?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. My mother won't be home until late at night. And my father won't be home for work, so don't worry about it." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's a lot of work for a Sunday. Does your mother have work too?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, She's on a day trip with her high school friends. She went out of the house with a skipping step." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"You have a cheerful mom, yea... How about your college older sister?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"She's been staying at her friend's place. I'm sure she won't come back today either." (Rinka)</div>

<div class="calibre5">Rinka says, looking a little sad.</div><div class="calibre5">She must really love her family.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't really understand.</div><div class="calibre5">In the end, I never got a hug. <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(PTW/N: not sure about this part, "kekkyoku, dakko[hug/carry] wa ichido mo shite moraenakattashi".)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">"Zzz~, Zzz~......" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">I can hear the sound of peaceful sleeping breath coming from my chest.</div><div class="calibre5">She really has fallen asleep.</div><div class="calibre5">Her sleeping face is very cute.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Is she an angel? <span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> Always has been)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">As I'm enjoying the cuteness of Nonoa-chan, Rinka gives me a poke on my left shoulder.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mm, what's wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's, I'm very happy that you're fond of my little sister, but....... I think you're giving her a little too much attention." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, who dyes her cheeks in vermilion, says in a small voice while averting her gaze in a shy manner.</div><div class="calibre5">......<i class="calibre6">Could it be, you're jealous?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Eh? Seriously?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"......Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I want you to pay attention to me too....even if only for a second." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka appeals to me with her upturned eyes, somewhat embarrassed.</div><div class="calibre5">What should I do, she looks dαmn so cute.</div><div class="calibre5">It's very different from the cuteness I've felt so far.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a lovely cuteness that spreads warmth in my chest......</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka....." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">The setting sun shining through the window creates a shadow on Rinka's neat face.</div><div class="calibre5">In the space where I can only hear Nonoa-chan's sleeping breath, the consciousness of me and Rinka are concentrated only on each other.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">We stare at each other at such a close distance that our lips can almost touch if we take a step forward.</div><div class="calibre5">I have the sensation that the flow of time is melting away, but at that very moment――――.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's been a while since I've been home! Seems, Rinka and Nonoa are... Eh, whose shoes are these!?"</div><div class="calibre5">A feminine but lively voice echoed through the door.</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no way..... my sister is back for the first time in a few weeks.....!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's face turned pale again.</div><div class="calibre5">The sweet and warm atmosphere vanishes in an instant.</div><div class="calibre5">......<i class="calibre6">That was dangerous.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I've been unintentionally swallowed by Rinka's charm.</div><div class="calibre5">We haven't even officially dated yet.....</div><div class="calibre5">"What do we do, have I hide on your bed again?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's too late for that..... Haa~" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that she has already reached the point of giving up.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, who exhales a heavy sigh, has a distant eye.</div><div class="calibre5">"Why it must be today...!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Ah right.</div><div class="calibre5">There are days like today.</div>
