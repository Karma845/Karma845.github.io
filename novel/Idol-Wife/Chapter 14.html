<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; "The Episode of Mizuki Family's Turmoil"</h3>

<div class="calibre5">It would be good if we could have ended the conversation in a good mood.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, Kazuto-kun. Are you listening to what I'm saying?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, I'm listening. I was just a little reminiscing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">As I was forced to sit on the floor in Rinka's room, I finished my reverie and came back to reality.</div><div class="calibre5">A week has already elapsed since the day I confided my true feelings to her.</div><div class="calibre5">In other words, two weeks have already passed since I found out that Rin's real identity was Mizuki Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">And today, Sunday. In the daytime.</div><div class="calibre5">An incident(?) happened again.</div><div class="calibre5">"Certainly, I did say that I would wait until Kazuto-kun could sort out his feelings. But I didn't say that I would overlook a cheating, did I?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Didn't say that you would forgive a little cheating?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course you'd be upset if you found out your partner was cheating on you, am I wrong? What? did you purposely cheat on me because you thought it would be forgiven, huh?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I didn't, I didn't! It was a misunderstanding! I'm sorry for saying unnecessary things!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I quickly bow my head and apologize to her, as she looks at me with ruthless eyes reminiscent of an assassin.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Aah, really, how did this happen?</i></div><div class="calibre5">Two days ago, Rinka told me, <i class="calibre6">"It's next Sunday, my family won't be home until the evening. Why don't you come over to my house around noon? I want to talk to you about something important. Ah, If you refuse......... let's better not to talk about it anymore."</i> I was invited (or rather, threatened) to come to Rinka's home, my legs were trembling greatly.</div><div class="calibre5">Relying on the address I was given, I arrived at a standard apartment building.</div><div class="calibre5">I walked into the building, somewhat wary of my surroundings, and stood in front of the room where the Mizuki family lived.</div><div class="calibre5">I pressed the doorbell and was greeted by Rinka, who dressed simply in a white T-shirt and shorts.</div><div class="calibre5">It was an attractive outfit that gave off a refreshing vibe but also showed off her slender figure.</div><div class="calibre5">Her long, slender, beautiful legs were so........beautiful.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I still can't sort out my emotions and my worries are increasing, but is it okay if I go up to Rinka's room?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">But I'd like to see the room of the popular idol I admired.</i></div><div class="calibre5">With a bit of hesitation, I stepped my foot into her beautiful room that was enveloped in wonderful girlish scents...... <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> how wonderful is it? I'd like to smell too... ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)&nbsp; .)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">"Let's thoroughly clean up Kazuto-kun's female relationships today, shall we." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">This is it, after all.</div><div class="calibre5">The illusions and ideals shattered fleetingly.</div><div class="calibre5">No, I like Rinka! I think it would be a good solution if I could say it......but,</div><div class="calibre5">I don't think I'm at that stage yet, or at least it's what I think.</div><div class="calibre5">I felt like I was in a dilemma.</div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps it was because of my realistic concerns, that caused I couldn't tell her or myself that I liked Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun, you need to be aware that you're popular. Once you do, you'll be able to deal with girls." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm aware of it, that I've never been popular. and I've even never been approached by a girl." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Don't tell me you've forgotten about the incident with Himekawa-san." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Ah, the finger fortune-telling thing, huh?</i></div><div class="calibre5">When I found out the meaning of fortune-telling, I was so surprised that I lost my waist.</div><div class="calibre5">I was surprised to find out that a girl in my class had taken a liking to me, even though I was just a nerd gamer.......</div><div class="calibre5">Well, since that day, Himekawa-san hadn't taken any action against me.</div><div class="calibre5">It was very likely that she was made to do a punishment game by her friends.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm not a popular type to begin with, you know.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that I'm popular to Rinka, but it's the online game that triggered it.</div><div class="calibre5">......<i class="calibre6">How can this me is a popular person in real life, man?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, then. If you're serious decide to clean up my game friend lists. I'll, end up becoming a loner....." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"But you have me, don't you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka can only log in for a few hours on weekends, right? So, during weekdays, I usually play with them." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I see.... So you're telling me to quit being an idol?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not saying that! I understand that you were working hard as an idol and I support you! I'm a big fan of Mizuki Rinka, and I'm not interested in any other idols besides Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-is that, so...... Thank you." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, with a light blush running down her cheeks, thanking me.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm not lying about my words.</div><div class="calibre5">In fact, when I watched <b class="calibre7">Star‚òÜMines</b>' music videos, I only pay attention to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">This was even before I knew who "Rin" actually was.</div><div class="calibre5">"I want you to continue and enjoy being an idol, and I want you to let my friends off the hook." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't wanna." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What a quick answer! Why not, at least a friend?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I've heard it before, men who put women off their guard like this have mistresses all over the place." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Who told you that?........ The sources of it, is absolutely twisted." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's Satoko-san, Satoko-san the '<i class="calibre6">Batsu 8</i>'." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really, who the h*ll is that person! Moreover, <i class="calibre6">Batsu 8</i>, what the.........." (Rinka) <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> I have no idea about "Batsu 8" [„Éê„ÉÑ8]; batsu hachi???; Things i know: "batsu"+game = "penalty game", and Batsu = ‚ùå.</span></i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre17">It's stuck in my mind for days, I tried to browse using its kana, but the result wasn't satisfying, tried again and found some articles about "batsu-ichi".&nbsp;It turned out that "batsu" is a slang and has a meaning about divorcement. <b class="calibre7">Batsu: divorced; ichi: one/once</b>. So~ the "Batsu-hachi",&nbsp;</span></i><span class="calibre17"><i class="calibre6">Surely you know the meaning of it, right?</i>üòÖ</span><i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Gosh, what a wealth of life experience she has.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"I'm home! Rinka-sis, are you home~?"</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly I heard a cute girl's voice from outside the room.</div><div class="calibre5">"Oh no, Nonoa is back.....! She said she was going to play with her friends until the evening." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's face quickly turned pale.</div><div class="calibre5">An unexpected thing happened,&nbsp;<i class="calibre6">her family came home.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Your younger sister?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. I have an older sister who is a college student and a younger sister who is in the first grade‚Äï‚Äï. No, this is not the time to discuss such things! Hurry up hiding!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't know if it's your parents, but if it's your younger sister, it's okay if she finds out, isn't it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't want to take unnecessary risks! Besides, Nonoa is so innocent that her mouth is light...... Kazuto-kun, hurry up and hide." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-where I've to?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I look around quickly.</div><div class="calibre5">But there is no place to hide in a tidy room.</div><div class="calibre5">Under the desk, the bed, inside the closet, or bookshelf...</div><div class="calibre5">If I have to choose, I'd go for the closet.</div><div class="calibre5">It has a door so I can hide in it, but......</div><div class="calibre5">"Hiding on my bed!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What, It's not the right place to hide, is it? The closet is more‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's okay, just hurry up!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know if it's due to Rinka is in a panic, but her judgment is impaired, or if she has a reason for wanting to avoid the closet.......</div><div class="calibre5">I was pushed onto the bed.</div><div class="calibre5">Furthermore, she covers me with a quilt.</div><div class="calibre5">...... Somehow, it smells really nice.</div><div class="calibre5">Don't think of me as a pervert, okay.</div><div class="calibre5">This is a girl's bed, and moreover, she's a popular idol</div><div class="calibre5">It would be terrible to tell me not to be aware of it.</div><div class="calibre5">As I was making excuses in my mind, I heard the door is opened with a bang.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, Rinka-sis! Are you at home today?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, I am. Anyway, Nonoa, what's wrong? You're going to play with your friends until the evening, aren't you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's right, but Aki-chan had to leave right away for an errand! So, Rinka-sis, please play with me." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"S-so that's it...... I'm a little busy right now, so go to the living room, okay." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kaayyy~." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">I can't see them because I'm hiding on the bed, but it looks like she was able to keep her little sister away.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Alright, save for now...</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, by the way, I saw a pair of shoes in the doorway, is Rinka-sis' friend coming to visit?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Oh bad! That was a blind spot.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What a complete blunder.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"U-umm...... It's none of Nonoa's business. You don't have to worry about the shoes‚Äï‚Äï‚Äï" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah! Someone is sleeping on my sister's bed!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Tsk, Nonoa, wait!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I want to play hide and seek too!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka calls her impatiently.</div><div class="calibre5">And then the sound of footsteps approaching.</div><div class="calibre5">The next moment, the quilt is pulled off with a bang.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">My eyes meet perfectly with the person who pulled off the quilt.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a little girl.</div><div class="calibre5">I can see my face reflected in her big and round eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">She, Rinka's little sister is terrifyingly cute.</div><div class="calibre5">The image of her appearance is that of a young Rinka, who has abandoned her cool elements and specialized in innocent cuteness.</div><div class="calibre5">Her hairstyle is pigtails (short twin-tail), and she uses her youthfulness to her advantage to create a sense of cuteness.</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan stares at my face and is stunned.</div><div class="calibre5">She probably didn't expect a man to be there.</div><div class="calibre5">I guess I have to introduce myself for now.</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you Nonoa-chan? Nice to meet you, I'm Ayanokouji Kazuto." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Yeah, greetings are very important.</div><div class="calibre5">It's even more important when you're meeting someone for the first time.</div><div class="calibre5">"My." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"My?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"My sister has brought home a MAAAAAAAANNNNN!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">A sweet and lovely shout echoed loudly in the room.</div>
