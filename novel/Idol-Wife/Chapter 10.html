<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; The Cool Girl, Intends to be my Wife in Real Life.
</h3>

<div class="calibre5">The time was 21:24.</div>

<div class="calibre5">It was almost time for Mizuki-san to call me.</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Restlessly, I walked around in my small room.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Is there a way to convince Mizuki-san without telling her about the meeting with Kurumizaka-san?</i></div><div class="calibre5">In the first place, I didn't want to lie to Mizuki-san.</div><div class="calibre5">If it was going to be like this, I should have turned down Kurumizaka-san's request.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, no one could have predicted this development, but.......</div><div class="calibre5">"Why am I so impatient ...?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't really know myself.</div><div class="calibre5">But I didn't want Mizuki-san to interpret it in a strange way.</div><div class="calibre5">As I was pacing around holding my head, the smartphone on my computer desk rang.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a phone call. It was from Mizuki-san.</div><div class="calibre5">After a slight hesitation, I picked up my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre5">I tapped the incoming call button, accepting the call.</div><div class="calibre5">"Good evening, Kazuto-kun" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Good evening..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It was Mizuki-san's voice, the same as always.</div><div class="calibre5">I concentrated on the conversation in my quiet room, where there was not a single noise.</div><div class="calibre5">"It was about today... I'm sorry for the harsh way I spoke." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh, no..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I was surprised at her sudden apology.</div><div class="calibre5">It was really unexpected.</div><div class="calibre5">"I can't help but be curious about Kazuto-kun's behavior. Wondering about who he's with, where he's going, and what he's doing....... Of course, I believe in you, but I can't get rid of this anxiety....... Can you tell me?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, maybe." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I understand that Kazuto-kun is a wonderful boy and that many different women are after him. That's why I feel insecure about him." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Insecure?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. I'm worried that you'll run to other women." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Run to other women?</i></div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san was talking as if she and I were dating.</div><div class="calibre5">"I know. Kazuto-kun will be popular, so you'll be courted by a lot of women." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I'm not popular at all! And I've never talked to a female student before!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It really made me hurt to hear myself say it.</div><div class="calibre5">Looking back on my life, Mizuki-san's was the first girl's contact I got.</div><div class="calibre5">The second was Kurumizaka-san's.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Isn't this pretty amazing?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Really? It's hard to believe. It's abnormal that Kazuto-kun isn't popular." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's normal. I'm just a gamer..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's how it is. Then it can't be helped." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It can't be helped?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. There is too much unnecessary information in this day and age. Maybe it's because of the Internet and the increasing number of rules in the world. It's funny for me to say this as an idol, but people who dress up and appeal to others are more accepted than those who act naturally....... That's what human society is all about." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's...... maybe somehow understandable." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">This is something that you can feel when you are in school.</div><div class="calibre5">For example, as a result of being quiet and trying to live a natural life, your classmates may label you as.... a loner or a dark-gloomy guy.</div><div class="calibre5">I was one of them.</div><div class="calibre5">It may have been a long time ago, but in this day and age, there is a tendency for quiet people to be considered inferior to cheerful people.</div><div class="calibre5">That was why some young people forced themselves to act cheerful, and in some cases, they ended up suffering from mental illness.</div><div class="calibre5">Given that, what Mizuki-san said probably was right, that the online game world was a world where you can live more seriously and naturally than in the real world.</div><div class="calibre5">"I think about it a lot, especially when I'm a student idol. I realize how humans are lustful creatures......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I couldn't even make a sound.</div><div class="calibre5">I could feel the hardship in her beautiful voice that I couldn't even imagine.</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course, if there are bad people, there are good people... And Kazuto-kun is one of those good people. He's a very wonderful boy." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"How can you be so sure? It's been less than a week since we've interacted in real life." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"We've been together on the internet for almost four years. We have a pure relationship where both parties are unencumbered by unnecessary information." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I felt a surge of emotion in my chest.</div><div class="calibre5">I could tell that Mizuki-san very valued her online game life with me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Moreover, I and Kazuto-kun are even married. I want you to stop talking casually with women other than me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"... It's only in-game, though." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, that's right. We're married in a world free of impure information, so we're a better couple than those who married in real life." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">.....</div><div class="calibre5">.........</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Hmm?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"I know we've gotten off topic, so let's get back to the main subject. What were you doing with that woman?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Please wait a minute. From my point of view, it was more important than that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"What are you talking about? What else could be more problematic for a married couple than an affair?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, isn't it strange! What do you mean, by married couple? I and Mizuki-san are just online game friends, right?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, that's right. We are friends on the Internet, and since we're married, we're also husband and wife." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, yeah. Right, that's right. But not in real life, right?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The sense of discomfort I had felt so far was rapidly building up.</div><div class="calibre5">I swallowed my saliva and waited for Mizuki-san to speak.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"……Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I've told you, right? Even though it's in the game, I'm not going to marry just anyone." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"You've." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I think it's because it's in the game that does not involve real information, we can have a real and true heart-to-heart relationship." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah. I won't deny it either." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"We get married in such a world, right?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">――――Even in real life, I'm Kazuto-kun's wife, right?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I was too shocked to utter anything.</div><div class="calibre5">I stood stunned in the middle of my room and froze in a position clutching my phone.</div><div class="calibre5">Saito and Tachibana had told me that Mizuki-san liked me.</div><div class="calibre5">But the reality was different.</div><div class="calibre5">No.</div><div class="calibre5">It already beyond reality!!</div><div class="calibre5">She was.......</div><div class="calibre5">The idol named Mizuki Rinka is――――intending to be my wife!</div><div class="calibre5">"What's wrong, Kazuto-kun? Did I say something strange?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...U-umm... Marriage is a bit..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's too much for me.</div><div class="calibre5">I want to think about it.</div><div class="calibre5">She was a very popular idol and I was a mediocre online game nerd.　</div><div class="calibre5">It's enough to say that we're like a moon and a turtle.</div><div class="calibre5">"Marriage is a bit, what? You're not going to say it's a mistake now, are you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"... What would you do if I said that?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I have no choice but to die." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"With Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Whaaat!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">You're going to take me to die with you, Dear popular idol!?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"I can't imagine a life without Kazuto-kun. Ever since I met him in real life, I can see my love for him growing even stronger." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"L-love... you said?..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I was astonished, it was beyond the feelings of happiness or embarrassment.</div><div class="calibre5">The word <i class="calibre6">"love"</i> seemed unrealistic to me as a high school student who was an online game nerd.</div><div class="calibre5">"Tell me honestly, Kazuto-kun. If you've been unfaithful, it can't be helped. I don't think I can monopolize a charming boy like Kazuto-kun from the beginning. The truth is, I'm very sad and I hate it, but...... I can overlook a little cheating." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Wa-wait, can you please not proceed with the conversation by yourself!? I can't keep up with the conversation in any way!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I asked for a pause in the conversation and gave her strong straight words.</div><div class="calibre5">But Mizuki-san changed her beautiful voice tone into a fragile impression and continued speaking.</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, so that's what it meant." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"....What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I've heard it before. I've heard that men who have cheated on their wives are good at playing dumb." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's different! I'm really not catching up with what you're talking about!!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's okay, Kazuto-kun. If you can keep me by your side and not abandon me, .......but I don't want many others." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Mizuki-san!? Are your brake off!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I felt that this conversation was going in a dangerous direction.</div><div class="calibre5">It was not like the brakes were broken.</div><div class="calibre5">It was more like a train run off the tracks and was crashing through the city.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun, remember this. Your wife is... me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Wait, Mizuki-sa――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre7">*Shut*</b> ♪</div><div class="calibre5">......The call was hung up.</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san's words, which were released one after another like a torrent, continued to spin around and around in my head.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ha, haha..... What the heck is that?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">There was only one thing I understood.</div><div class="calibre5">She, a cool girl is, intending to be my wife in real life――――.</div>
