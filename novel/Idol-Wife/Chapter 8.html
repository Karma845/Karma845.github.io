<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; "What were you doing with that woman?"</h3>

<div>I was brought to the rooftop's landing stairs.</div><div>It was a place that was not popular and it would be difficult to be overheard.</div><div>I was sure I wouldn't be noticed here.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, it's Kazu-kun! Long time no see, yes!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Noticing me coming, Kurumizaka-san jumped off the stairs in a low jump.</div><div>At that time, her skirt fluttered up&#8213;&#8213;I quickly turned my face away.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hmm? What's wrong, Kazu-kun?" (Nana)</div><div>"N-no, it's nothing." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Is that so, thank you for coming all the way, Kazu-kun!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san's face broke out in happiness, and she grabbed my hands vigorously.</div><div><i>It's soft...</i></div><div>I enjoyed the happiness of having this ticketless handshake event.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Is this the end of my role?"</div><div>"Yup, thank you Kotone-chan!" (Nana)</div>

<div><br /></div><div>A girl called Kotone was about to leave.</div><div>Just before that, she looked back at Kurumizaka-san and said something like this.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah~. Maybe he's a sincere and kind guy." (Kotone)</div><div>"Yup, I know, right?" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san reacted as if it was obvious.</div><div>And also, she was still holding my hand...!</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hmm, I see." (Kotone)</div><div><br /></div>

<div>The girl, Kotone, turned her face to me and gave me a look as if she was trying to assess me.</div><div>It was uncomfortable.</div><div>After a while, Kotone seemed to be convinced of something and nodded her head in satisfaction before disappearing down the stairs.</div><div><br /></div><div>"W-what was that?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"I wonder what it was. Kotone-chan speaks and acts things for no reason, so maybe we shouldn't worry too much about it." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't really understand it, but if that was what Kurumizaka-san said, then let's just forget it.</div><div>&#8230;&#8230;Anyway, that's it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Umm, Kurumizaka-san...?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I looked down at my still-clasped hands and tried to make a confused appeal.</div><div>My embarrassment was outweighed by my happiness.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah, I'm sorry!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san stepped back with a blush on her cheeks.</div><div>I was sure I had a similar expression on my face.</div><div><br /></div><div>"... So what is your business, Kurumizaka-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Ah, yeah. You know.... I have a favor to ask of you, Kazu-kun." (Nana)</div><div>"A favor?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What is it?</i></div><div>I don't think I, as an online game nerd, can fulfill an idol's request.</div><div><i>What if I was asked to buy 100 CDs with handshake tickets?</i></div><div>Somewhat anxiously, I waited for Kurumizaka-san to speak.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Please get along better.....with Rin-chan!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san said that, and lowered her head briskly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Get along... I think Mizuki-san and I are pretty good getting along in the game." (Kazuto)</div><div>"That's not what I meant. I want you two to get along in real life, not only in the game." (Nana)</div><div>"Even if you say that..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>If possible, I would like to have a conversation with Mizuki-san daily.</div><div>But that would be a bad idea.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Of course, we're idols, so if we're close with a certain boy, there will be a bit of a stir...." (Nana)</div><div>"I don't think it's a bit, but that's why I and Mizuki-san talked and decided not to talk at school." (Kazuto)</div><div>"I see. That's why Rin-chan looks so happy but also lonely these days." (Nana)</div><div>"...?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Looks happy yet lonely?</i></div><div>That was an expression I don't understand.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Can Kazu walk up to Rin-chan? I think Rin-chan will be very happy with that." (Nana)</div><div>"If possible, I would like to do that ... but if I had a nice conversation with her in public, wouldn't it be rumored at school or in the public?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Then... let's just get along in secret so that no one knows!" (Nana)</div><div>"Eeh....." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san's eyes sparkled as if it was a good idea.</div><div>I couldn't hide my confusion at this mysterious push of her.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Or does Kazu-kun hate Rin-chan?" (Nana)</div><div>"No, that's not the case...." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Please! Please get along with Rin-chan!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san was desperately asking me.</div><div>When I saw her like that, I decided to ask her a simple question.</div><div><br /></div><div>".....Why does Kurumizaka-san want me and Mizuki-san to get along?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>It would be very risky from the standpoint of an idol.</div><div>If anything, she would give me money and said, <i>"Stay away from Rin-chan!"</i>, Isn't it okay to say that?</div><div>It might be an exaggerated idea, but I did think the issue of idols and men should be handled with that much sensitivity.</div><div>Especially in this very day and age.</div><div><br /></div><div>"T-that is.... I can't tell you about it, or rather, I must not tell you..." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Averting her gaze away from me awkwardly, Kurumizaka-san was putting her fingers together and fidgeted</div><div><br /></div><div>"Did Mizuki-san ask you to do something by any chance?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"No! Rin-chan did not ask anything! I'm just doing it on my own!" (Nana)</div><div>"Ah, I see..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>She denied it greatly. She was a little impatient.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I want to, I want Rin-chan to be happier, because she has been through a lot of tough times up until now..." (Nana)</div><div>"..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br />

</div><div>She didn't mean it as a student idol.</div><div>I had a feeling she was using the word "tough" differently.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I want Rin-chan to be happy as an idol and as a girl. I don't want her to give up on either one." (Nana)</div><div>"I see......" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I didn't understand the situation at all.</div><div>However, I could feel Kurumizaka-san's seriousness painfully transmitted to my heart.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Can you get along with Rin-chan in real life too?" (Nana)</div><div>"Well, yeah... I also wish I can get along and get to know with Mizuki-san better than I do now..." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Really? Thank goodness, I'm glad." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san let out a sigh of relief.</div><div>She really cares about Mizuki-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>"What should I do specifically to get along with her?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Umm... First of all, how about changing the way you call her?" (Nana)</div><div>"Change the way I call her?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Yes. Actually, Rin-chan doesn't like it when Kazu-kun calls her in a stranger's manner." (Nana)</div><div>"Huh? Is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Yeah. So you better call her Rinka, Kazu-kun." (Nana)</div><div>"Seriously? Wait, that's a bit..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>That was a very high hurdle.</div><div>As I said to Tachibana and Saito, I didn't have the slightest bit of courage to do that.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Are you nervous after all?" (Nana)</div><div>"Yeah, I am." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>How could I not be?</i></div><div>Just thinking about it made my heart flutter.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Next Saturday is a good chance. I think you should start by calling her by given name in the game, and then you can get used to it in real life." (Nana)</div><div>"I wonder if I can get used to......?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>There was a big difference between calling her <i>"Rin"</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>"Rinka"</i>.</div><div>The significance of it changed.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I'll follow you implicitly, so do your best to call Rin-chan by her name, kay!" (Nana)</div><div>"&#8230;&#8230;Okay." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I nodded my head in agreement with Kurumizaka-san's somewhat forceful tone.</div><div>This attitude of her was somehow similar to Mizuki-san's.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Thank you Kazu-kun! You're the best!" (Nana)</div><div>"...Kurumizaka-san is, pushier than I thought, yes..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>What I was asked to do was to be Mizuki-san's real and close friend.</div><div>I had a common hobby of online gaming, so I wanted to believe that it was not so difficult.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That's why Kazu-kun. Please exchange contacts with me." (Nana)</div><div>"Ee, is that okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Of course! It's to get Rin-chan and Kazu-kun together&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;no, We need to discuss a strategy for you two to get along, right? So it's a good idea to know each other's contact and it's also more convenient. Of course, We can't let Rin-chan know about this." (Nana)</div><div>"Well, I guess so..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>If Mizuki-san found out about this secret meeting, she would definitely get angry.</div><div>So it was necessary to keep it secret in order to protect Kurumizaka-san's position.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Shall we exchange it right away?" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>I took out my phone as she asked me to.</div><div>We finished exchanging our contacts without any problem.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Okay, all done!" (Nana)</div><div><br />

</div><div>With this, the contacts of two popular idols had been registered on my smartphone.</div><div>......This smartphone might be the most valuable in the world.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rin-chan and Kazu-kun's good friendship mission, begins!" (Nana)</div><div>"...O-ooh!?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I wonder what this is.</div><div>It felt like there were moats around, and they were already filled.</div><div>Before I could think of anything else, I felt like Kurumizaka-san was forcing me to proceed.</div><div>But, if I could get to know Mizuki-san better than I did now, I'd be happy.</div><div>The problem was if the public found out about this......</div><div><br /></div><div>Fortunately, we had a common world that was separated from the real world.</div><div>I was sure it will be fine as long as I didn't screw up too badly.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>&#9633;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>That evening.</div><div>Mizuki-san called me when I was online at home.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>While thinking that it was rare she phone called me, I stopped mining and picked up my smartphone.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hello." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Hello, Kazuto-kun, yes? I'm sorry to call you out of blue." (Rinka)</div><div>"No, don't mind about it." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>In addition to Mizuki-san's voice, I could hear the voices of a group of girls busily talking on my smartphone.</div><div>The voice quality is idol-like.</div><div><i>Is Mizuki-san calling me in the middle of something</i>?</div><div><br /></div><div>"The break is almost over, so I can't talk for too long, but... I had one thing I really wanted to ask Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div>"What is it?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I replied without thinking deeply.</div><div>......And that turned out to be a mistake.</div><div>Mizuki-san asked the question in a chill tone, different from her usual.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;What were you doing with that woman during today's lunch break?" (Rinka) <i><span style="color: #800180;">(<b>PTW/N:</b> Yandere vibe ga KITTTAAAAAA~)</span></i></div><div><br /></div>
