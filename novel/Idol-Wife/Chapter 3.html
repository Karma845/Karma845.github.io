<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; A Cool Popular Idol and the Cafeteria</h3>

<div>When we arrived at the cafeteria, we ordered the A set meal.</div><div>There was an empty table in the corner, so I sat down facing Mizuki-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was expecting to attract a lot of attention from the people around me, but it turned out to be not so much.</div><div>I guess it's hard to stand out in a noisy cafeteria full of people.</div><div>I could feel the occasional glance, but not enough to cause a commotion.</div><div>Maybe I was being a little too sensitive.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I can't believe Kazu was Kazuto-kun. I'm surprised." (Rinka)</div><div>"I'm surprised too." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was probably a hundred times more surprised than Mizuki-san.</div><div>I was slightly confused by that and the fact that she called me by my first name as a matter of course.</div><div>It was probably reasonable, considering how close we were in the game.</div><div>I think I'll call her Rinka-san too.</div><div><br /></div><div>.....</div><div><i>Absolutely impossible.</i></div><div>If I had the courage to do so, I could have made a hundred female friends.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You use Kazu as player name because your name is Kazuto, don't you? I think it's too simple." (Rinka)</div><div>"I don't think you have the right to say it either, Mizuki-san. Since you just like me, you use Rin because your name is Rinka, am I wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"That's right....... I wonder if we are in sync with each other. We have the same naming taste." (Rinka)</div><div>"M-maybe." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh man, I was so nervous about something.</div><div>I was furiously happy to hear Mizuki-san say that we were in sync.</div><div>I poked at the grilled fish with my chopsticks, tore, and brought it to my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>......I can't taste it.</div><div>I was so nervous that my tongue had lost its sense.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It's like a dream come true to be able to eat like this with Kazu." (Rinka)</div><div>"I-is that so? I'm sorry, because that friend is someone like me." (Kazuto)</div><div>"You don't have to be so down on yourself. I'm relieved that Kazu's real identity is Kazuto Ayanokouji." (Rinka)</div><div>"Relieved?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"Eerm. Because he's even nicer than I expected." (Rinka)</div><div>"......" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Can I die now?</i></div><div>It's definitely flattery, but I'm moved to tears.</div><div>I don't have a single regret in this life!&#12288;</div><div>I thought, but I still wanna play online game.</div><div>I was a greedy person.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I wonder how likely is the chances of me getting married to a classmate." (Rinka)</div><div>"About the chances of a meteorite raining down on us, I guess. W-well, even if you say marriage, it's on the internet, though." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I said that, Mizuki-san quietly put down her chopsticks.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kazuto-kun. Just because it's on the Internet doesn't mean it's inferior to the real thing." (Rinka)</div><div>"Ee?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"This is my opinion, but I think that it is because on the internet, where you can't tell what a person looks like or who they are, that you can find out more about their mind and their nature." (Rinka)</div><div>"Y-yeah, I see...?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"I'll tell you the truth, out of all the players I've met, Kazu is the most sincere and pure." (Rinka)</div><div>"...I-is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Whether I was sincere or not, I was definitely enjoying it with a pure heart.</div><div>There were no impure feelings when interacted with Rin.</div><div><br /></div><div>"When my idol career wasn't going well at all and I was going through a tough time, Kazu encouraged me many times." (Rinka)</div><div>"Ah... that reminds me, something like that had happened, yes." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>At one point in time, Rin had been having hard times.</div><div>It was so obvious even through text chatting.</div><div><br /></div><div>I wondered if something bad had happened to her in real life, so I tried not to ask what was going on and just followed up......</div><div><br /></div><div>"If I hadn't met Kazuto-kun online, I would have retired from being an idol before I reached high school." (Rinka)</div><div>"You're exaggerating me." (Kazuto)</div><div>"It's not an exaggeration. In fact, it was at the beginning of the first year of high school that we, Star&#9734;Mines, started to gain popularity. It was really really tough until then." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mizuki-san added, <i>"Well, it always has been tough even after we started selling"</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>According to the information on the official website, Star&#9734;Mines was formed when the members were in the second year of middle school.</div><div>However, in the first few months after its formation, the group's popularity was low, and they were even considering disbanding at one point.</div><div><br /></div><div>From that situation, they grew into the very popular idol group that they are today.</div><div>It must have been a lot of blood and sweat that I can't even imagine as I'm known as an "online game nerd".</div><div>If I was even a little bit of support to Mizuki-san, I would be very happy about that.</div><div><br /></div><div>"In reality, a lot of people with ulterior motives come to me, and most of the male players change their attitude when they found out I was a woman on the internet." (Rinka)</div><div>"That sounds much of troubles, yes." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I'd never been popular with anyone, but I could sympathize a little bit with Mizuki-san when she spoke bitterly.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kazu was the only one in that situation. He was the only one who was consistent in his attitude toward me no matter what......." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mizuki-san smiled nostalgically as if she was cherishing a precious memory.</div><div>Looking at her, memories of the time when I first met Rin suddenly revived.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>[My name is Rin. I'm a beginner, please take care of me.] (Rin)</div><div>[I understand. Well, it's a game, so let's have fun and don't get too formal.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>After a week.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>[Kazu-san. If you don't mind, would you like to dive into the dungeon with me again today?] (Rin)</div><div>[Sure.] (Kazu)</div><div>[I would be grateful if you could teach me some other things.] (Rin)</div><div>[Okay. Then, after diving into the dungeon, let's go mining.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Thank you very much.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div><br />

</div><div><br /></div><div>Another month later.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>[Kazu. What are we going today? Anything is fine~] (Rin)</div><div>[Hmm. Shall we do some mining today?] (Kazu)</div><div>[Let's!] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>And half a year passed.....</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>[I wanna go fishing!] (Rin)</div><div>[Ee, I want to mine today.] (Kazu)</div><div>[I wanna go fishing!] (Rin)</div><div>[Ummm.] (Kazu)</div><div>[I wanna go fishing!] (Rin)</div><div>[How pushy you are.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>......</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Rather, wasn't it Rin who changed!</div><div>She's getting bolder and bolder!</div><div><br /></div><div>"Kazuto-kun. Are you listening to me?" (Rinka)</div><div>"Y-yeah, of course." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I nodded greatly when asked suspiciously.</div><div>It seemed that she knew that I just wasn't listening, and Mizuki-san's lips twitched in dissatisfaction.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Haa~.... well. I mean, I'm not going to marry just anyone, even on the Internet. No, I think it's because of the Internet that a person's mind is more more important than being captivated by superfluous information." (Rinka)</div><div>"Ha haa..." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Or, you do think in a different way, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div>"No, I'm the same way. Marriage is an important event even in the online games." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>For the time being, I tried to keep the conversation on track, but frankly speaking, I think everyone has their own way of thinking about in-game marriage.</div><div>It's not bad to aim for the benefits of marriage, and I think it's wonderful to get married with a special feeling like Mizuki-san's did.</div><div><br /></div><div>"It was good. I'm glad to hear that you feel the same way as I do, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div>"Y-yeah." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mizuki-san patted her chest as if relieved.</div><div>......I wonder what this buzzing feeling is.</div><div><br /></div><div>I feel like something is definitely off with her.</div><div>I interpreted this as Mizuki-san and I being "close enough" to get married in the game.</div><div>However, in the case of Mizuki-san, I feel like the orientation seems to be different from that of......?</div><div><br />

</div><div>"Oh, Rin-chan! It's rare for you to come to the cafeteria."</div><div><br /></div><div>I heard a cute girl's voice that seemed to be a condensation of cheerfulness.</div><div>Then, a girl who's the owner of the voice, came over to Mizuki-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Oh my, Nana. Today you're also cheerful, yes." (Rinka)</div><div>"Well, yeah! Because I've eaten a lot of food!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>She had slightly long hair and her name seemed to be Nana.</div><div>Her unordinary lovely face, had a bright, friendly look on it.</div><div><br /></div><div>&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;No, wait a minute!&#12288;</div><div>Don't tell me this girl is......!</div><div><br /></div><div>"Eh? This boy over here, is he Rin-chan's acquaintance?" (Nana)</div><div>"Eerm. He's Ayanokouji Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div>"I see. My name is Kurumizaka Nana! I'm one of the Star&#9734;Mines members like Rin-chan! It's nice to meet you~!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>With a carefree smile, she&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;Kurumizaka Nana asked me for a handshake.</div><div><br /></div><div>She was a popular idol who is said to be the closest friend of Mizuki Rinka, and Star&#9734;Mines' center.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
