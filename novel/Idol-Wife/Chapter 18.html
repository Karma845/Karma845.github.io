<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Mizuki Family Gathering</h3>


<div class="calibre5">"Gosh, Kazuto-kun is an interesting boy, yea~!" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yea yea. It's fun talking with you." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">While waiting for their mother to return, I'm forced to deal with Kasumi-san and Nonoa-chan.</div><div class="calibre5">As we relaxing in the living room, I become Kasumi-san's conversation partner and Nonoa-chan's playmate...</div><div class="calibre5">It's a lot of work to be taken care of.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka is standing in the kitchen and preparing for dinner.</div><div class="calibre5">She wears an apron with her hair is tied in a ponytail.</div><div class="calibre5">I can see her back from here, and just only looking at her made my heart pound.</div><div class="calibre5">"Eee, what's wrong, are you fascinated by Rinka?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-well... I am." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's rude to deny it, so I admit it vaguely.</div><div class="calibre5">My gosh, she's really cute.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm probably the first '<i class="calibre6">ordinary</i>' person to see a cool idol at home.</div><div class="calibre5">"Today we're going to have curry! Does Kazuto-bro like curry?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"I like it...... Oucchh-." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan pulls my bangs lightly.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What would you do if I became a young bald?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Today's curry is sweet, you know." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"I see. It's been years since I've had sweet curry. I wonder if she's making it sweet to suit Nonoa-chan." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, She's not. I love spicy food." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"What a great elementary schooler you're, your palate is crazy...... Ah, then it's sweet to suit Kasumi-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hahaha, Kazuto Boy. Do you think I'd satisfied with something sweetness?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"What's with the '<i class="calibre6">Boy</i>' thing?...... No, in my image Kasumi-san's palate is dry." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Right? So, the reason why it's sweet..." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Correct!" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">I-I'm surprised. I didn't know that Rinka is a sweet tooth.......</div><div class="calibre5">I'm under the impression that she'll be fine even if she eats very spicy food.</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka-sis is not good with spicy food! Yesterday, She was crying just by licking the chili pepper on the udon!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">"She is really not that good at it? Those things on udon are less pungent, aren't them?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know why, but I'm a little happy to learn about an unexpected side of Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">For some reason, I feel like I'm on the winner side.</div><div class="calibre5">"We wanna eat spicy food, but since Rinka is the only one who can cook, so we can't go against her." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"<i class="calibre6">Heeh~</i>. Are you not good at cooking, Kasumi-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, no, no, it's impossible for me! Just the other day, I tried to make boiled eggs in the microwave and they exploded. Ahahahaha." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yaay~! Explosion~ explosion~!" (Nonoa)<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8"> (<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> is she going to grow up to be an explosion maniac??!)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">"That's not something to be laughed at. It's a serious problem, seriously." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">If it is a game, it'll be as bad as selling your main weapon by mistake after spending several weeks raising the enhancement value.</div><div class="calibre5">In this day and age, it's common knowledge that you can't cook an egg in the microwave.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto Boy. This is a proverb you should remember." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......What's it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san, who is sitting opposite me, grins and pulls her face close to mine.</div><div class="calibre5">"<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre18">Life is――――an explosion</span></i>." (Kasumi) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> is she a pupil of some <b class="calibre7">Crimson Archwizard</b>&nbsp;or some <b class="calibre7">Clay Artist</b>??)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">"Art is an explosion, isn't it should be? If life explodes, everything is over, you know?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">If Saito is here, he'll probably say something like this,</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">'According to my calculations, there is a 1000% chance that the Mizuki family is crazy!'</i></div><div class="calibre5">As I was looking at the giggling Kasumi-san with half-lidded eyes, I heard the sound of the front door opening with a bang.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems their mother has arrived.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's mommy~." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre5">Nonoa-chan rushes to the door, with adorable steps.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What is she doing, it's overly cute.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I'm a high schooler, but I really want a daughter right now.</div><div class="calibre5">Then Nonoa-chan drags her in, and Rinka's mother finally appeared――――.</div><div class="calibre5">"<i class="calibre6">Pheewhhhaaaa~</i>. Ah, it's dangerous. The floor is shaking." (Mom)</div><div class="calibre5">......She's drunk as h*ll.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's mother, her face is dyed bright red, staggered dizzily.</div><div class="calibre5">Oh, by the way, Kasumi-san told me before.</div><div class="calibre5">That she's having a little drink with her friends before she went home.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Is it......just a little bit?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, Mom. I'm embarrassed. Please pull yourself together." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahaha, sorry Rinka." (Mom)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, who rushes in from the kitchen, hands a glass of water to her mother then she chugs it down.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......What is this feeling?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I don't know how to describe it, but it's totally different from what I imagined.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">She is the mother who raised Rinka, isn't she?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I've imagined her to be more strict.</div><div class="calibre5">No, considering Nonoa-chan's and Kasumi-san's personalities, it would be strange if she's rather strict.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Does that mean that Rinka, who grew up to a cool personal, a heretic?</i></div><div class="calibre5">But if it's Rin, it's not so strange.</div><div class="calibre5">"Yo-u a-re, Ayanokouji...... Kazuto-kun, riiiiigght?" (Mom)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I am." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">My voice is inarticulately.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's mother comes up to me, smelling of alcohol.</div><div class="calibre5">She also grabs my face with both hands.</div><div class="calibre5">"My my. You've got a cute face. Are you a boy from Johnnys?" (Mizuki Mama) <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N: </b>Johnnys (ジャニーズ, Janīzu) was a Japanese boy band,&nbsp;&nbsp;formed in April 1962.)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, I'm not." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really? What a waste. Why don't you apply now?" (Mizuki Mama)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What is she talking about?</i></div><div class="calibre5">She's too drunk.</div><div class="calibre5">"Come on, Mom. Don't bother Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Mmm Rinkaaa." (Mizuki Mama)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki Mama is dragged by Rinka to sit on the sofa.</div><div class="calibre5">She doesn't look like a woman with a daughter of a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kufufu, It's a surprise, isn't it, Kazuto Boy?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"It is...... Also, what's with that '<i class="calibre6">Boy</i>' thing again?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Our mom is usually terribly serious, but when she gets a little alcohol, she turns into someone else." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I see......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I wonder how she's usually like.</div><div class="calibre5">Watching her being cared for by Rinka on the sofa, I can't help but think she doesn't seem like a very serious person in general.</div><div class="calibre5">I somehow continue to watch them from the sidelines.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka exchanges some kind of conversation with her mother, and for some reason, she walks up to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, Kazuto-kun. My mother asked me to give this to you." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka somewhat hesitantly holds out her smartphone to me.</div><div class="calibre5">I receive it naturally.</div><div class="calibre5">But I immediately regretted it.</div><div class="calibre5">The smartphone is on a video call, and the man on the screen is a sturdy-looking man with glasses.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not hard to guess who this man is.</div><div class="calibre5">"Good evening. You must be Ayanokouji Kazuto-kun. I'm Mizuki Mikio, Rinka's father." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Good evening." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What a mad rush.</i></div><div class="calibre5">Little Sister → Big Sister → Mother → Father.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a full course of the Mizuki family.</div><div class="calibre5">I've them all in one day.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry to greet you like this. I couldn't come home from work." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, please don't worry about it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'd like to not meet him, even by phone if possible.</div><div class="calibre5">"I heard that you and Rinka are dating......." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"U-umm, That is....... There's a little misunderstanding about that......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"A misunderstanding?" (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">Mikio Papa lifts his glasses quickly and makes a heavy voice sound.</div><div class="calibre5">The pressure is unbearable.</div><div class="calibre5">If it's going to turn out like this, I definitely will be forced to go home.</div><div class="calibre5">"Actually, I've known Rinka-san for years through the online game. In real life, we are just friends(?) who have recently started interacting." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I confess everything honestly.</div><div class="calibre5">I've come this far because I've been swept along with everything else, but I think it's better to be clear with her father.</div><div class="calibre5">He's the one who scares me the most, and that's why I should be honest with him.</div><div class="calibre5">Even if he despises me, I should tell him.......</div><div class="calibre5">"Ayanokouji-kun." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"So, in other words, you're saying that my family is getting carried away on their own, is that what you're saying?" (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I'm sorry! It's...... just the impression I get!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's not a wrong expression.</div><div class="calibre5">I mean, it's the fact.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">A heavy silence hung in the air.</div><div class="calibre5">Mikio Papa puts his hand on his chin and pretends to think.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Ayanokouji-kun." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I understand your situation. Perhaps my prediction is correct." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What does that mean?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I listen to Mikio Papa's words.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ayanokouji-kun. I've been down that road before." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-what?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Do your best." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-what do you mean? Why you've got such a philosophical look in your eyes!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll give you some advice from a veteran. <i class="calibre6">Dare to pick a job that requires a lot of business trip!</i>" (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Mikio Papa says with a mysterious and heavy voice.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know what the h*ll he's talking about.</div><div class="calibre5">"My wife is a lovestruck. But it's exhausting to be stuck around all the time, every day. I can't get rid of my tiredness even in the morning." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"So what are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre18">Love sometimes drives a person to the path of despair</span></i>............. Engrave these words to your heart." (Mizuki Papa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Please wai-" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Beep~, beep~. <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> I'm really really not good in onomatopoeia </i>😅️<i class="calibre6">.)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">The video call ended.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Why do they always ignore my words and hang up halfway through the call?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Mikio Papa......, what the h*ll happened to you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">This might have been the moment I caught a glimpse of the darkness in the Mizuki family.</div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps he had something with Rinka's mother.</div><div class="calibre5">That something is something that has been going on for a long time and is still going on.</div><div class="calibre5">Mikio Papa has warned me about something in a short video call.</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you done, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yeah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I return the smartphone to Rinka with my right hand, which for some reason hasn't stopped trembling.</div><div class="calibre5">Maybe I'm, already in a bottomless pit that I can't get out of.</div><div class="calibre5">Yes, it's as if I've wandered into a death game where the logout function has disappeared......</div><div class="calibre5">"What's wrong, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's nothing......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka in her apron with her hair in a ponytail is very cute.</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't understand what Mikio Papa was talking about, but let's just enjoy the moment.</div><div class="calibre5">Escapism is my forte.</div>
