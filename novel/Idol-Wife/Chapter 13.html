<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; The Starting Line</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"I guess it's time to go home." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The view of the cityscape from the window was getting darker.</div><div class="calibre5">I had come to Saito's house for a visit, and I told the two that I was about to go home.</div><div class="calibre5">This information might be unnecessary, but Saito's room was really dirty.</div><div class="calibre5">There were so many light novels and mangas scattered about that it was hard to find a place to step.</div><div class="calibre5">If you say it's a typical high school boy's room, then yes, it is.......</div><div class="calibre5">"What? Isn't it too early to go home? You usually stay up later than this to have fun." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, I have an appointment tonight." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I said to Saito, who was lying on his bed reading a light novel.</div><div class="calibre5">Today was Saturday.</div><div class="calibre5">I was going to play an online game with Mizuki-san and Kurumizaka-san tonight.</div><div class="calibre5">"What do you mean by 'appointment'? Who else can you play with other than us?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"I've heard that line a few days ago...... it's with Mizuki-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Didn't you get rejected by Mizuki?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I didn't. It's kind of a pain in the αss to explain..... I'll show you the authentic proof, guys." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I took out my smartphone and showed them the chat I had with Mizuki-san.</div><div class="calibre5">What was displayed on the screen was the exchange that started with the morning greet (I love you) the other day, recognizing ourselves as a husband and wife.</div><div class="calibre5">"Is this, for real.....?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"This is for real. Don't tell anyone, okay? I still can't believe it, either......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">""........."" (Tachibana, Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">Saito and Tachibana stared at my smartphone and started to tremble like crazy.</div><div class="calibre5">When I was wondering what was going on, they suddenly screamed.</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, no no, it's a lie, isn't it! Life is too UNFAIIIIIIRRRR!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"A-aa-ac-according to my calculations, ......... AAAAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">Both of them were unsightly and screaming strangely.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm sorry to say, but the appearance of them holding their heads, their eyes turning white, spitting, and screaming was extremely ugly.</div><div class="calibre5">My cheeks tensed up, I tried to escape as I put my hand on the doorknob.</div><div class="calibre5">"Wait, AYANOKOUJIIIIIII!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Whoa, what the h*ll!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Tachibana clung to my waist and said with a zombie-like voice.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not going to let you go like this! While you play husband and wife with a popular idol, we have to play with each other, huh, bastard?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, yeah ... It can't be helped, right." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I have no choice in the matter, do I?</div><div class="calibre5">I tried to open the door and get out of the room, but Tachibana tightened his grip on my waist.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not going to let you go!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ugh, seriously, let me go! If you don't, I'll be in trouble with Kurumizaka-san――――ah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The moment I said it, I knew I had dug my own grave.</div><div class="calibre5">I was so impatient that I was leaking unnecessary information.</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-you, no way..... you'll play online game with Nana-chan, too?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"So you will? I'll take your silence as an affirmation!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"...N-no, it's different, you know?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's no different! Ayanokouji, you're a terrible liar, I can tell right away! Aaah DAMMITTT, you have a flower in each hand!? I'm so f-kin' jealous!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"... According to my calculations, the probability of us going insane with jealousy is――1000%!!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">The next moment, even Saito, with his bloodshot eyes, jumped on me.</div><div class="calibre5">The two of them were coming at me.......!</div><div class="calibre5">"Wa- stop iiiiiiitttttttttt~!" (Kazuto)</div>

  <div class="calibre5">□</div><div class="calibre5">[It's too late, Kazu!</div><div class="calibre5">What have you been doing before ٩(๑`^´๑)۶ ] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">As soon as I logged in to the game, I received such an angry message from Rin.</div><div class="calibre5">It was kinda cute and made my cheeks loosened.</div><div class="calibre5">In the end, because of Saito and Tachibana, I was about twenty minutes late.</div><div class="calibre5">I replied, "I'm sorry", and then launched the voice chat app on my computer.</div><div class="calibre5">I selected the chat room that I had created with Rin and clicked on the voice channel to enter the room.</div><div class="calibre5">There were three players in the room.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazu," "Rin," and "Sturmangriff."</div><div class="calibre5">............Who?</div><div class="calibre5">There was a player with its username contain some awesome characters.</div><div class="calibre5">"You were late, Kazu. We've been waiting for you for a long time, you know?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">Rin, who dressed in a cool outfit, said to me.</div><div class="calibre5">It had a very different atmosphere from the cute chat that was sent to me just a few minutes ago.</div><div class="calibre5">......Well, it's not like I'm going to go into it.</div><div class="calibre5">I was sure she had her own reasons.</div><div class="calibre5">I was more interested in Sturmangriff.</div><div class="calibre5">I'd known who it was, but I couldn't help but ask.</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, who is Sturmangriff?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, hey! It's me! Kurumizaka Nana, y'know!" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">A cheerful and lively voice echoed from the headphones.</div><div class="calibre5">And it was quite loud.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey Nana. You're talking too loud. Keep your voice down." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, Sorry~." (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">It appeared that Kurumizaka-san, who usually made a lively voice, was in the same boat in voice chat.</div><div class="calibre5">I casually ask her about the origin of her name.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kurumizaka-san. Why is your username Sturmangriff?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, y'know.... It's the name of a cat I have! What do you think? Ain't it a cute name?" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">For a moment, I thought it was a joke waiting for a retort, but the cheerful tone of Kurumizaka-san's voice made me realize that she was serious.</div><div class="calibre5">As I was struggling for words to reply, Rin took over the conversation.</div><div class="calibre5">"Nana's sense of naming is different compared to most people. Don't let it bother you." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's not true! I'm normal, y'know!" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">...... Absolutely not normal.</div><div class="calibre5">Also, I just looked up the meaning of "Sturmangriff" on the Internet, and it appeared to mean "Assault" in Deutsch.</div><div class="calibre5">I wonder what Kurumizaka-san is going to make her cat do.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sturm――――Nana has already finished the tutorial. I'm sorry, Kazu, but could you please come to the first village?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Okay. I'll be right there." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed that calling her by her player's name was becoming annoying. <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> Poor Nana-chan)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san called her by her real name. So, I would do the same.</div><div class="calibre5">As I was told, I got on my horse and took a few minutes to arrive at the first village.</div><div class="calibre5">On the way to the village, I talked to Kurumizaka-san, who had finished the tutorial but still wasn't used to the controls.</div><div class="calibre5">That's why, until she was getting used to the controls, we had to fight the small monsters around the village.</div><div class="calibre5">I walked my character to the central square of the peaceful village to gather with the girls.</div><div class="calibre5">There, what awaited me was a lovely blonde elf carrying a bow on her back, "Rin", and a burly macho oldman beastman carrying a great ax, "Sturmangriff". <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;</i>⁰×⁰<i class="calibre6">)</i></span></div>

  <div class="calibre5">......</div><div class="calibre5">"... Hey, Kurumizaka-san. You're definitely playing for gag-play, aren't you?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">On the Black Plains, you can make your character in a rather detailed way.</div><div class="calibre5">The character that Kurumizaka-san had created was a muscular daruma that seemed to have all the parameters raised to the max.</div><div class="calibre5">"Gag-play? Emm this character, Ain't it cute?" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">"I have to say it. Kurumizaka-san, your taste is crazy." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"EEEEEEHH? Even Kazu-kun too?" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">I think anyone would say that.</div><div class="calibre5">Everyone would say that it's cute, because it's obvious that the character design is a joke.</div><div class="calibre5">"Now that we've confirmed Nana's crazy taste, let's go hunting right away." (Rin)</div>

  <div class="calibre5">"Boo~, Rin-chan and Kazu-kun are so mean." (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">Even though she was pouting her lips and leaking out a dissatisfied voice, Kurumizaka-san followed Rin out of the village.</div><div class="calibre5">Not long after, we came to a grassland area inhabited by monsters.</div><div class="calibre5">"Oh, look! There's a big and cute cat over there!" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's a Serval Cat. Be careful, it's the strongest monster around here. Nana will never be able to beat it right now, so stay away from it――――" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's so cute! Look at it, it's having so much fun pouncing on me!" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, Nana! You're being attacked! Run, quickly!" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"What? I don't know how to run――――ah." (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">[Party member: Sturmangriff has fallen]</div><div class="calibre5">A death announcement was mercilessly displayed in the chatbox.</div><div class="calibre5">It happened less than five minutes after we left the village.</div><div class="calibre5">Instead of charging in, she died standing on the spot.</div><div class="calibre5">"Nana......" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry. Rin-chan" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">Rin grumbled Kurumizaka-san's name in annoyance.</div><div class="calibre5">I guess I'll take care of the enemy for now.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazu", who had maxed his level, swung his sword and killed the Serval Cat.</div><div class="calibre5">By the way, the Serval Cats were not cute at all.</div><div class="calibre5">They looked like cats, but had physiques as big as humans and had vicious looks.</div><div class="calibre5">They even had huge fangs coming out of their jaws.</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's get ourselves together and proceed. Kazu, please." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">I guessed the meaning of her words, and went around in circles, killing only the monsters that might give Kurumizaka-san trouble.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, with this, I may be able to win!" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">An oldman beastman with a huge body was swinging a great ax that matched its physique and trying to tear apart a small weasel.</div><div class="calibre5">However, Kurumizaka-san seemed to be unfamiliar with even normal attacks, and the weasel occasionally ducked her attacks.</div><div class="calibre5">It wasn't a click-and-choose target, so it might be hard for the novice Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Nana is more than I imagined....... No, let's not say any more." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">I knew what Rin was thinking..</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san probably was a person who had no sense of game.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, I'm sure she's just purely a lack of gaming experience.</div><div class="calibre5">While Kurumizaka-san was struggling with the weakest monster, Rin and I continued to hunt the monsters around us.</div><div class="calibre5">It was not satisfying at all, but just being able to listen to the sound of Kurumizaka-san's happy voice was enough for us.</div><div class="calibre5">"Y'two are in perfect synch, ain't ya?" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly, Kurumizaka-san said such a thing.</div><div class="calibre5">"What do you mean?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"You two were giving each other instructions by just calling name, right?" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">"Well yeah... The monsters around here are weak, so there's no need for complicated coordination....." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rin and I have been together for a long time. So we can understand what the other person wants without thinking about it." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's right. It's what we call 'heart-to-heart communication'." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">Rin said a little proud.</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san was impressed and said, "Hee~, it's amazing, yes".</div><div class="calibre5">And so we hunted for a few dozen minutes, while conversing randomly.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry. I've got something to do. I'll leave for a bit, kay." (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">After stopping her hunting, Kurumizaka-san left, even though she still logged in.</div><div class="calibre5">Since she was also still online in the voice channel, I was sure she was planning to come back soon.</div><div class="calibre5">As I was thinking this, I heard a notification from the smartphone on my desk.</div><div class="calibre5">I checked it.</div><div class="calibre5">There was a message from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">[The place has been warmed up with a good feeling! Now that it's just both of you, it's your chance!] (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Needless to say what the chance is.</div><div class="calibre5">Probably it was about the name-calling.</div><div class="calibre5">She requested me to call Mizuki-san "Rinka".</div><div class="calibre5">I replied to Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">[It's too sudden. I'm not ready for this.] (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">[It's okay! You could call her "Rin" normally, right?] (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Now that she'd pointed it out, I realized.</div><div class="calibre5">Certainly, I used to call Mizuki-san "Rin".</div><div class="calibre5">[All you've to do is add the "Ka"! It's easy peasy, right!] (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Like h*ll, it's easy peasy.</div><div class="calibre5">The more I became aware of it, the more nervous I became to even call Rin.</div><div class="calibre5">"What's wrong, Kazu? Suddenly became silent." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"A-ah, umm... Rin, ka... Kakapos are flying." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kakapo? Where are they? Are there Kakapos in the Black Plains?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5"><blockquote class="calibre13"><span class="calibre8">(</span><b class="calibre14">PTW/N:</b><span class="calibre8">&nbsp;better you'd skipped this~.... It's originally "Kamome" or <b class="calibre7">Seagull</b>. I hesitate to pick "Kakatoo/Cockatoo" or "Kakapo".... but in the end, I chose "Kakapo"; I tried to do a little joke here, Kakapo is actually </span><span class="calibre15">[from what I read]</span><span class="calibre8"> a 'flightless' parrot. <strike class="calibre16">Awoka</strike>---sorry, LoL)</span></blockquote></div>

  <div class="calibre5">[......] (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">A silent taunt is sent from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">I can't say anything back.</div><div class="calibre5">.........</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't know what is this.</div><div class="calibre5">I've always had this strange feeling.</div><div class="calibre5">This vague feeling had swirled in my chest.</div><div class="calibre5">Probably I would be able to get along with Mizuki-san without Kurumizaka-san's encouragement.....</div><div class="calibre5">In addition, Mizuki-san liked me so much that she wanted to be my wife in real life as well.......</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah. That's right." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazu? What really happened?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">I ignored Mizuki-san's suspicious and set my thoughts.</div><div class="calibre5">All the events that had happened in the past week and the memories with Mizuki-san flow through my mind.</div><div class="calibre5">It'd been a really intense week.</div><div class="calibre5">It'd been so hectic, and my daily life had easily been drastically changed.......</div><div class="calibre5">And Mizuki-san was always in the center of it.</div><div class="calibre5">If she was really thinking of me, I should be able to give her my true feelings fairly and honestly.</div><div class="calibre5">That was what it meant to be equal.</div><div class="calibre5">A heart-to-heart relationship where there were no impurities, it was the kind of relationship that Rin, Mizuki Rinka wanted.......</div><div class="calibre5">I readied myself, and then I slowly opened my mouth.</div><div class="calibre5">"Rin... No, Mizuki-san. Can you listen to me for a second?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"... What it is, yes?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">She seemed to have sensed something from the serious tone of my voice.</div><div class="calibre5">I could feel the tension in Mizuki's voice.</div><div class="calibre5">"...Actually, I only thought of Mizuki-san as a good friend on the internet." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">I could hear her breath catching through my headphones.</div><div class="calibre5">Then I could hear my smartphone rang.</div><div class="calibre5">It was from Mr. Kurumizaka.</div><div class="calibre5">She is still listening to the conversation, huh?</div><div class="calibre5">I could guess what she was about to talk.</div><div class="calibre5">But there was no need to respond to her.</div><div class="calibre5">I turned off my smartphone and continued talking.</div><div class="calibre5">"I have feelings of admiration for Mizuki-san, but I don't know whether this is a romantic feeling or not." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"So... it was...." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki replies with a shaky voice.</div><div class="calibre5">I felt like he was about to fall into a stupor.</div><div class="calibre5">But my talk didn't end here.</div><div class="calibre5">I haven't gotten all of my true feelings out yet.</div><div class="calibre5">"But I want to respond to Mizuki-san's feelings. No, I want to know more about Mizuki-san, and I want to be closer to her than I already am. I want to face Mizuki-san properly in real life as well." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"......eh?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"So, as a first step ... Can I call Mizuki-san 'Rinka'?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">I was able to say it smoothly despite my nervousness.</div><div class="calibre5">There was a brief silence.</div><div class="calibre5">The moment the possibility of being rejected crossed my mind, I heard Mizuki-san's voice.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Of course, I'm fine, but that is......" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"What it is?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"As far as I've heard, I think Kazuto-kun likes me too." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"That... I can't deny the feelings of admiration that one have for an idol..... You don't like it either, do you Mizuki-san? I was confessed by an idol, then I said accepted." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's very unpleasant. I think it's because I'm inside a game world that there's no unnecessary information involved, I can have a pure heart-to-heart relationship. But I absolutely refuse to go out with someone who accepted me because of my position as an idol." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">The tone of Mizuki-san's voice was a little rough, and she spoke up at once.</div><div class="calibre5">However, her next words were in a softer tone.</div><div class="calibre5">"... But I'm convinced, knowing that Kazuto-kun likes me." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"......huh?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"You're still confused and can't figure out your own emotions. It's okay. I understand you better than yourself, Kazuto-kun. So you have nothing to worry about." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">H-hey......</div><div class="calibre5">Somehow, the direction of the conversation is turning into a strange way.</div><div class="calibre5">"I've heard it all before. That some men don't realize they had become husbands even after marriage." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's not what I'm talking about. In my case, my closest gaming friend and the popular idol I admired were the same one person, so I'm confused in various ways..." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">In addition to that, both also had an extraordinary fondness for me.</div><div class="calibre5">It would be impossible not to be confused.</div><div class="calibre5">"If so, I'll wait." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-wait, eh?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. I'll wait until Kazuto-kun sorts out his feelings and accepts his relationship with me." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-thank you......?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">It was probably the most reassuring words I had ever heard.</div><div class="calibre5">I needed time to properly face my emotions.</div><div class="calibre5">"I was surprised at first, though. I don't know whether Kazuto-kun likes me or not." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Uh, well..." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"But what he said after that made me understand. Kazuto-kun really likes me." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, Mizuki-san? Isn't this conversation getting looping?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">It was more precise to a contradiction rather than a loop.</div><div class="calibre5">I insisted that I don't know if I like her, but I want to get along with her even in real life.</div><div class="calibre5">For that reason, I asked her to let me call her Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">However, Mizuki-san interpreted this as a sign of liking, even if I meant it.</div><div class="calibre5">"Well......, Even if Kazuto-kun's feelings were that of a friend or respect instead of love, it wouldn't matter."</div><div class="calibre5">"Huh?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's a simple matter, you know. 'I'm a wife', all I have to do is become a woman that Kazuto-kun will fall in love with." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ummm, sorry, I don't know what you just said." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's not difficult. In short, since you got married before you fell in love with me, you just have to fall in love with me now." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">Ah... So that's it.</div><div class="calibre5">I see, i see.</div><div class="calibre5">I could just about understand it even though my head was in a little panic.</div><div class="calibre5">Mizuki-san was still "thinking of herself as a wife" even in this situation.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm glad that Kazuto-kun confided his true feelings. It's true that it wasn't the answer I wanted, but...... I was able to find out what Kazuto-kun really felt without any falsehoods." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Mizuki-san..." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"My, did I hear you wrong? I thought you would call me by my name from now on." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Rinka." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">I called out to her in a whisper.</div><div class="calibre5">But I didn't hear a reply.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm, Rinka? You suddenly became silent... I knew it, you didn't like it huh?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I'm sorry. I was so happy that I couldn't even breathe." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-what the h*ll is that..." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">I'd never heard of anyone who couldn't breathe because they were so happy just because someone called their name.</div><div class="calibre5">Does that mean she likes me very much?</div><div class="calibre5">......I was embarrassed just thinking about it.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun. You've been worried about me all the time, haven't you?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's not that I'm worried......." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, If you've come this far, you are." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">I couldn't say anything back.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka clearly expressed her feelings to such a pathetic me.</div><div class="calibre5">"You don't have to think too much about it. It's just that...... I'm falling in love with Kazuto-kun on my own." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">Just falling in love with me on her own.......</div><div class="calibre5">Does she know how precious those words are?</div><div class="calibre5">It was not a matter of calculating, nor was it a matter of being attracted by looks or status.</div><div class="calibre5">It was just that she was in love with me in person.</div><div class="calibre5">"And...... I wonder if Nana is listening to this conversation, though she's pretending not to." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahahaha. Did I get caught?" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san reappeared with an unassuming laugh.</div><div class="calibre5">She seemed to have surrendered from making a convincing statement.</div>

  <div class="calibre5">"There was a little noise. I don't know, but I sense some kind of conspiracy." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">Sharp. She was as smart as she looked cool.</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't think she knew everything, but she likely knew about the connection between me and Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry, Rin-chan. I wasn't doing this with any ill intentions." (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's okay. Whenever Nana did strange things, it was always for my sake." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rin-chan......!" (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san raised her voice emotionally.</div><div class="calibre5">"But I don't like it when she plays silent and sneaky." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rin-chan..." (Sturmangriff)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san's voice now became apologetic......</div><div class="calibre5">"But, right. If you are planning to apologize,... I wonder if you can be just a little tactful." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">Be a little tactful?</div><div class="calibre5">I wondered what it meant.</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't know, but Kurumizaka-san seemed to understand that.</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course! I'd be happy if both of you became much closer than you are now. So ... Kazu-kun, please take care of Rin-chan."

At the same time Nana deliberately left the room, you confided your true feelings to me. This didn't seem like a coincidence." (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no... that's." (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll have you spit it all out. What kind of interaction did you have with Nana behind the scenes... all of it, okay?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">"...Umm, can we talk about it in the text chat?" (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">"Why?" (Rin)</div><div class="calibre5">The reason was, that "Rin" was more friendly and easy to talk to.</div><div class="calibre5">But I couldn't say that, though.......</div><div class="calibre5">"I thought it would be easier to explain in writing."

Don't tie it to cheating right away!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre5">Cheating was a.......</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka was thinking of herself as my wife, no matter what.</div><div class="calibre5">I thought it was strange, but strangely enough, I didn't hate it.</div><div class="calibre5">Nowadays, I even felt relieved.</div><div class="calibre5">Maybe it's because I told her all my feelings......?</div><div class="calibre5">I might not carry much value, as I was an online game nerd.</div><div class="calibre5">But there was one thing I was sure of.</div><div class="calibre5">Peoples would be able to understand each other without conflict if they stripped away the unnecessary information and told each other their true feelings.......</div><div class="calibre5">[So you had nothing with a girl named Kotone.
