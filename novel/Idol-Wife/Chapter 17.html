<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; S-sis!?</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"Next isâ€•â€•â€•â€•let's say hello to our mother." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san says with an air of calmness</div><div class="calibre5">What the h*ll did this person say.</div><div class="calibre5">When I get to that point, there's no turning back.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sis. I think it's too early to say hello to mother." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What? You guys are supposed to be husband and wife, right? Then why not?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"That is......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka glances at me with a sideways glance.</div><div class="calibre5">I know what she is hesitating about.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, who is waiting for my answer, is behaving like she is my wife, but she doesn't want this to develop into something that important.</div><div class="calibre5">"Both of you like each other, don't you?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm, what's wrong?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">When she sees us shutting our mouths, Kasumi-san tilts her head.</div><div class="calibre5">"Actually, that is...... Kazuto-kun isn't yet aware that he's my husband. Now I'm waiting for him to sort out his emotions." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"A-ah..... I see. In other words, Ayanokouji Kazuto-kun is halfway there." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">The way she says it, makes Rinka look like a weird person.</div><div class="calibre5">......But I can't deny it.</div><div class="calibre5">"But don't worry. It's just because Kazuto-kun just doesn't realize it yet, that he loves me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......... My little sister is getting gloomier without me knowing it." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san looks at me as if she's asking for help.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">There's nothing I can do about it, you know.</i></div><div class="calibre5">If I think back, it's been like this since the first day.</div><div class="calibre5">"L-let's see. Let me get this straight again. Rinka is thinking you two as a married couple, right?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Eermm..." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Then what about you, Ayanokouji-kun?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......She's a gaming friend..... And a classmate who I've recently started interacting with in real life." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Do you like Rinka?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Talking about <i class="calibre6">'like'</i>...... I can't say for sure if it's a romantic feeling. But, I've always admired Mizuki-san as an idol for a long time." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, this is becoming a very troublesome situation, isn't it? And the one who complicates the situation the most is Rinka." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"That, what do you mean by that?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It doesn't mean anything. It just means what it means." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Just because Kazuto-kun is unsure, it doesn't change the fact that we're married." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Eh, is this the so-called <i class="calibre6">Yandere</i>? Or is it a <i class="calibre6">Stalker</i>?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Please don't say anything rude. I'm going to get angry regardless you're my big sister." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka says with a hint of anger in her words.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm starting to see the relationship between you guys. At first I thought you were both in love and acting like a married couple, but....... Isn't this just Rinka following Ayanokouji-kun around?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5"><div class="calibre5">That statement sounds correct, but also incorrect.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm kind of accepting of it for some reason.......</div><div class="calibre5">I don't admit us as a couple, though.</div></div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not. It's natural for a couple to be together, right?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Rinka............" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san finally holds her head.</div><div class="calibre5">Or maybe <i class="calibre6">"lost for words"</i> will be more suitable.</div><div class="calibre5">Then she raises her head and looks at me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ayanokouji-kun......" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Our Rinka...... Please take care of her." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Pardon!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I mean, You're the one and only one, who can accept this kid's deep love." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"W-what are you talking about!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Look, Rinka is super cute, isn't she? I think she's one of the best looking women in the country, aside from her family. In addition to that, she is smart, a good singer, a good cook, and a cool idol who is called a superbly beautiful girl....... Yes, she's perfect, right?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"You're talking like you're pushing a bad debt." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Aaaah! Enough! Rinka who was never interested in men, even I once had thought <i class="calibre6">"Huh? Is this kid a l*sbian?"</i> or so! Brought a guy home, you know!? This is the last chance!" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eeh......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san spits out a desperate rant and pushes me.</div><div class="calibre5">What the h*ll is this......</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't know what Ayanokouji-kun is worried about, but there is also a love that begins after dating. As the first step of all, why not try <i class="calibre6">crossing the line</i> with Rinka?" (Kasumi) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;My my... </i>( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°) <i class="calibre6">)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">"I see, there is such a way of thinkingâ€•â€•â€•â€•No way I will do! It's a <i class="calibre6">fait accompli</i>, isn't it!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's fine! Or, are you dissatisfied with Rinka!?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's not that I'm dissatisfied or anything......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm glad you're thinking seriously about Rinka, but isn't it possible to act with momentum like a young man?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kasumi-san......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm surprised when she says that.</div><div class="calibre5">I've been thinking about it too much, and I've been getting hung up on it.</div><div class="calibre5">"Just simply leave it to the overflowing libido, right." (Kasumi) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;what the...&nbsp;</i>ðŸ˜…<i class="calibre6">)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She's the worst.</div><div class="calibre5">This person, she's said something indecent from the very beginning, she may be a pretty dangerous person.</div><div class="calibre5">"That's why I'm going to contact my mother~. Well, why don't you have dinner with us." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">As she says it, Kasumi-san takes out her smartphone and starts calling.</div><div class="calibre5">From the sound of the conversation I hear, the other person seems to be her mother.</div><div class="calibre5">She's moving things along at an incredible pace, Kasumi-san is.</div><div class="calibre5">I thought she was a carefree woman by appearance, but she has exceeded my imagination by a long shot.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry, Kazuto-kun. Before I know it, this has happened." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"D-don't mind it......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, who is sitting next to me, apologizes sincerely.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not her fault, probably.</div><div class="calibre5">I have no choice but to prepare myself for the worst.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Aah, I want to play online games......</i></div><div class="calibre5">Is that wishing of mine just now a manifestation of my escapism, I wonder.</div>
