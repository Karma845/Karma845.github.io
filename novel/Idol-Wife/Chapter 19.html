<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Mizuki Kasumi (2)</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"You know, you could've just stayed overnight if you wanted to." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"As expected, that's........." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahahaha, just kidding, just kidding." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san, who is sitting in the driver's seat and holding the steering wheel, smiles mischievously at me.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't think it's kidding.</div><div class="calibre5">As I sit in the passenger seat, I gaze out the window at the changing nighttime cityscape.</div><div class="calibre5">I remember what happened just a few minutes ago.</div><div class="calibre5">After a lively dinner with the Mizuki family.</div><div class="calibre5">It was late in the day for students to be wandering around.</div><div class="calibre5">The Mizuki family, concerned for my safety, suggested I stay overnight, but I politely declined.</div><div class="calibre5">Tomorrow is Monday and I have a normal school day.</div><div class="calibre5">......I don't dare stay overnight even if it's a holiday.</div><div class="calibre5">When I told them I was going home, Kasumi-san said she would give me a ride home.</div><div class="calibre5">By the way, Rinka stays at home to take care of Nonoa-chan and her mother.</div><div class="calibre5">She is such a kind girl.</div><div class="calibre5">"Like this, I wanted to talk to my little sister's boyfriend alone~" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not her boyfriend yet, though." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ooh? 'not yet', ye~s." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......That's not what I meant." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The car slowly comes to a stop as the traffic light signal changes.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't mean to be rude, but I think that Kasumi-san is the type of person who will boldly ignore traffic lights.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, it's a normal violation, so she won't do it.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, Kazuto-kun" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"What is it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"If you are going to cross the line with Rinka, make sure you <i class="calibre6">use</i> c*ntrac*ption, okaay." (Kasumi) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;</i>( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<i class="calibre6">&nbsp; )</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">"Bufff―! Wh-what are you talking about!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"The pregnancy scandal is indeed a big problem, isn't it? You see, Rinka is a popular idol after all." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-that's true......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">How can you say such words calmly, Kasumi-san!</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Does one's sense of sexuality change when one becomes a college student......?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Am I just not used to it?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Or it just Kasumi-san's personality is.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, I'm still inexperienced by the way." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I didn't ask it......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really? But you have a face that looks like you did?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Can we not talk about it any further? I don't know what kind of face to put on." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahaha, you're so innocent, yes." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Sorry." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know why I'm apologizing.</div><div class="calibre5">The light turns green and the car starts running again.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know how to describe it, but driving in the city at night has a mysterious feel.</div><div class="calibre5">Inside the car is enveloped in a quiet atmosphere, with only the sound of the car running echoing through the cabin.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun, is there someone else you like?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"There isn't...... why?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, it just you're still keeping your reason even though Rinka is approaching and compelling you so much, aren't you? So I wonder if there is anyone you really like." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......I don't have anyone I like." (Kazuto)</div>

<div class="calibre5">"Hmm. Then, you're very popular? Like you're too popular to be satisfied with just Rinka." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not popular at all." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Isn't it just that you don't realize it, Kazuto-kun? If I'm in the same class as you, I'll never leave you alone." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm glad to hear you say that, Kasumi-san. Even if just a joke." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahaha, It's not a joke. I'm actually a little envious of Rinka." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I'm a little envious of Rinka.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I feel that those words she just said contain many different meanings.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......What should I say in response to?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I'm not confident in my communication skills, so I don't have any idea at all.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Why don't you try jumping out of a car like in an action movie? aiming for her laughs.</i></div><div class="calibre5">......I must be crazy.</div><div class="calibre5">What kind of thinking I have here.</div><div class="calibre5">"I know I said a lot today, but if you really don't like Rinka, just tell me honestly. I'll take care of it." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......I don't hate Rinka, It's just that I haven't made up my mind yet." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I see...... well, think about it carefully okay. I'm glad you're not one of those boys who mess with girls without thinking twice." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san smiles at me with a sense of security.</div><div class="calibre5">She behaves like she's joking around, but I guess she's serious at heart.</div><div class="calibre5">I think I've been able to understand a little more about Kasumi-san's personality in this short time we've been together.</div><div class="calibre5">In a calm atmosphere, I continue talking with Kasumi-san for a few minutes.</div><div class="calibre5">Then the car arrives at a square near the station.</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you sure you want to be dropped off here? I can give you a ride to front of your house, you know." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I'm fine. My house is just a short walk from here." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really? You don't have to hesitate, you know." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"I feel like walking a little, So thank you very much." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I get out of the car and bow to Kasumi-san.</div><div class="calibre5">She opens the car window and speaks to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"I know I'm being insistent, but Rinka and Kazuto-kun seem to be a good match, so I'm sure you two will somehow make it." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Thank you very much. I will try my best to become a man worthy of Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahaha. You are fine as you are, Kazuto-kun. You should have more confidence in yourself." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Smiling gently, Kasumi-san encourages me.</div><div class="calibre5">I guess this is what so-called the charm of older people.</div><div class="calibre5">It makes me a little nervous.</div><div class="calibre5">"See you, Kazuto-kun. Good night." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Likewise, good night." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">After waving lightly at me, Kasumi-san starts the car and drives away.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps this is because the lingering effects of my conversation with Kasumi-san are still in my heart.</div><div class="calibre5">My heart is thumping soothingly.</div><div class="calibre5">"In many ways, college students are amazing, yes." (Kazuto) <span class="calibre8">

<div class="calibre5">It's like a first-grader looking up at a sixth-grader and realizing the huge difference between them.</div><div class="calibre5">"Now, shall I head home?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's surprisingly fun to take a walk in the city at night while recalling what has happened on the day.</div><div class="calibre5">With that thought in mind, I head home.</div><div class="calibre5">Tomorrow will be the start of another extraordinary day with a popular idol, I thought with a little smile on my face――――.</div>
