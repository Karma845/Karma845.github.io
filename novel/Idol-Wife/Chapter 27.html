<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; Kazuto-kun Goods</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"Even Kazuto-kun will find it creepy, as expected....... I made Kazuto-kun dolls and sleeps with them in my arms every day......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-that's not true." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">When I nod, Rinka's expression changes from teary-eyed to smiling.</div><div class="calibre5">She regains her smile as if she has blossomed.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Well, I'm surprised, though.</i></div><div class="calibre5">If it's just one doll, I'll have smiled, but as expected, four dolls are scary.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">How long does it take to make a felt doll?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">It's only been a month and a few weeks since Rinka and I met.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Isn't that a pretty fast pace?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Actually, there are more." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What, More Kazuto-kun doll?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No. It's the second set of Kazuto-kun goods." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka says a little proudly.</div><div class="calibre5">As I watch to see what she's going to do, Rinka flips through a poster of <b class="calibre7">Star☆Mines</b> on the wall.</div><div class="calibre5">What emerges there is――――a mini-poster with a cut-out scene of me eating in a classroom.......!</div><div class="calibre5">"How do you think? Don't you think he's really cute?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't think so. I mean, isn't that a voyeur shot......? I'm not looking at the camera, and I don't remember being shot in the first place." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's not a voyeur shot. There's nothing voyeuristic about taking a picture of your dear husband, isn't there? (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">This is high level</i>.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I never think my first date can be so tumultuous.......!</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Every night before I go to bed, I hug Kazuto-kun dolls and look at Kazuto-kun poster.......Fufu." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka shouldn't be the one looking at the poster, she should be the one being looked at, right." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">A very popular idol is making dolls of me, taking a voyeur shot, and making it into a poster.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Oh man, this is terrific.</i>&nbsp;<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> read; yabee~ yo yabee~ yo)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry, Kazuto-kun. I'm slightly aware that what I'm doing is weird." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh, just slightly aware?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"But I just can't stop my feeling....... If I can live under the same roof with Kazuto-kun, my desires would be more or less satisfied." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-is that so......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm speechless.</div><div class="calibre5">I've never expected that Rinka's desire will be this much.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">.......Wait, speaking of which.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"You did mention the second Kazuto-kun goods, didn't you? Perhaps, there is also a third one?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka opens the pencil case on her desk and takes out her eraser.</div><div class="calibre5">"I've got a picture of Kazuto-kun's face pasted on the eraser's cover." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"This way, I can feel close to Kazuto-kun's presence even while studying. Don't you think it's groundbreaking?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... I guess, so............" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know what face to make anymore.</div><div class="calibre5">And even I don't know if I should laugh, be surprised, or be shocked.......</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Which one is the right reaction I should have?</i></div><div class="calibre5">For the time being, I decide to be pleased.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">To be treated like an idol by a super popular cool idol, isn't it a wonderful thing!</i></div><div class="calibre5">"W-well, ...... as a man, I'm very happy to be liked this much." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really? I'm worried that even though you are a gentleman, you might be repulsed to me, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, no, no. Think about it. It's not that different from the way idols have always sold their goods, isn't it? So, this's not so different from that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"You're right. Thank you, Kazuto-kun. For accepting such a me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">......Well, there's a difference between having consent and not having.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll ask you, but you don't have any goods about me more, do you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......It's not goods, though......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka opens a drawer in her desk and takes out a sheet of paper.</div><div class="calibre5">"That is?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"This is our marriage registration. It has both of our names on it." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, you've crossed the lineeee~! This is dangerous! And it even has Ayanokouji's seal on it!" (Kazuto) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> Learn more about marriage registration (Kon'in-todoke): <a href="https://www.la.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/m02_04_02.htm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre">https://www.la.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/m02_04_02.htm/</a>)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">It's a crime.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Don't worry. I made this marriage registration myself, and I've left off the necessary fields, like the registered domicile, so it won't be accepted even if I submit it." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Please rest assured, I know what I'm doing." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-you're...... sure you know...... what you're doing?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm confused.</div><div class="calibre5">"Every time I see this marriage registration, my heart is filled. It's right, I and Kazuto-kun are a married couple." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"O-oh......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka hugs the marriage registration and smiles with satisfaction.</div><div class="calibre5">On the other hand, I'm confused.</div><div class="calibre5">"Real-world is inconvenient. There is an age limit for marriage and such....... But don't worry. Even if we are not recognized as husband and wife here, our hearts tied up in the game world are real." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Y-yea." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">What a surprise.</div><div class="calibre5">Shocking facts are revealed one after another.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not that her love is heavy.</div><div class="calibre5">But, she's already entered the realm of perversion!　</div>

<div class="calibre5">"............This is creepy after all, isn't this?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">As I tremble in trepidation, an anxious, downcast Rinka asks me in a quiet voice,</div><div class="calibre5">"From an objective point of view, my behavior is beyond the limit. Aside from dolls, erasers, posters,............ marriage registration are weird, right." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Objectively speaking, everything is weird.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"No matter how gentleman you are, Kazuto-kun, you sure don't like a girl who does weird things like this, do you............." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That is not true." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka keeps talking while looking down, even though I've given an immediate answer.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's okay, you don't have to force yourself. If you think I'm creepy...... you can cut me out of your life." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What are you talking about?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I love you from the bottom of my heart, Kazuto-kun. That's why, I wish and priorities for Kazuto-kun's happiness." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"If I become a burden to Kazuto-kun, ............ You can divorce me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Divorce.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">We're not even in a relationship yet.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sure you'll meet a better woman than me, Kazuto-kun. So if I interfere with your happiness, I――――." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I call her name to interrupt her words.</div><div class="calibre5">She raises her face that looks as if she's about to cry and stares back at me.</div><div class="calibre5">"As I said before, I will accept Rinka as she is." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"But didn't you think my behavior is going too far, did you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yup." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... See, I knew it." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka snorts.</div><div class="calibre5">When I look at her closely, I can see her eyes are moist.</div><div class="calibre5">I think she might really cry if I treat her badly here.</div><div class="calibre5">"If it bothers you so much, why did you tell me about Kazuto-kun goods?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"... I value the relationship with my heart. That's why I decided that I should say it when Kazuto-kun asks me. To let him know the real me I've hidden until now...... " (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">If I never asked, she would have kept it to herself forever?</div><div class="calibre5">......No, it's not.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a secret that Rinka, who believes in the supremacy of the pure heart, is so afraid of being exposed.</div><div class="calibre5">"Please be honest with me. If you can't keep up with me any longer...... please don't force yourself to do. I don't want to be a burden to you, Kazuto-kun......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">She turns her eyes away from mine and says such a thing with a slightly quivering voice.</div><div class="calibre5">For her, her closet is a <b class="calibre7">Pandora Box</b>.</div><div class="calibre5">If you open it, disasters and incidents will spurt out.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">.......However.</i></div><div class="calibre5">However, still.</div><div class="calibre5">Hope still remains at the bottom of the box.</div><div class="calibre5">Everyone has a secret they don't want to be exposed to.</div><div class="calibre5">It's no different even for a very popular idol.</div><div class="calibre5">But Rinka is prepared to be hated and told me.</div><div class="calibre5">Thinking of her own beliefs and my happiness, she chose to tell me.......</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">So, to answer her determination, what can I do for her?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Haha, there's only one thing I can do for her.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I'll tell her how I really feel without hiding anything.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Because we've――――been interacting with each other in the world of online games for several years.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Kazuto-kun......?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">With tears in her eyes, I confidently answer Rinka as she waits for my response.</div><div class="calibre5">"I, whatever Rinka is, will accept her as she is." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Really?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, because I'm...... deeply in love with the very existence of Mizuki Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's eyes widen and she takes a breath.</div><div class="calibre5">Without paying attention to her, I slowly begin to speak.</div><div class="calibre5">"Even if Rinka isn't an idol, I'll still be in love with her. I know my words will be harsh, but even if Rinka is surprisingly ugly, it won't change my mind." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Kazuto-kun......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, if <i class="calibre6">she</i> is actually a man, I'd like to make him taste one punch. Haha." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I try to laugh and say something to make her laugh.</div><div class="calibre5">However, Rinka, whose cheeks are dyed bright red, only holds her mouth with both hands.</div><div class="calibre5">She gazes at me with eyes so moist that tears about to spill.</div><div class="calibre5">I want to take away her anxiety and turn it into joy.</div><div class="calibre5">And now, is the very right time to say.</div><div class="calibre5">"<b class="calibre7">I――――love Rinka</b>." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I say it clearly.</div><div class="calibre5">I say the words I haven't been able to say before.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't need courage or anything.</div><div class="calibre5">I just say what is obvious, as if it's natural.</div><div class="calibre5">That's all.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun ......, even if I'm like this, are you really okay?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It must be Rinka for me. What you're worried about? If it's about voyeurism and dolls, I'll just have to laugh and accept them, won't I? Well, if I notice them, I'll make some comments, though, but it won't make me hate you, even for the slightest." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Kazuto-kun......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I guess, liking someone means accepting everything about them. It's never about having expectations or imposing ideals." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">If I hate Rinka after learning her secrets, it isn't because I love her, it's because I love Rinka with the cool idol label on her.</div><div class="calibre5">It is not about liking Rinka the way she is.</div><div class="calibre5">And that was something that Rinka had said many times before.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">In the online game, you can throw away the labels and expectations imposed by the public.</i></div><div class="calibre5">It's the only place where you can face others genuinely and purely.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry it took me so long to say this. <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">I've been in love with 'Rin' for years</span></i>." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"............." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Even after I found out who she actually is, my feelings won't change. It's not about your status as an idol or your beautiful looks, I love Mizuki Rinka. Even in real life...... please go out with me on the premise of the marriage." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I said it. I've said everything.</i></div><div class="calibre5">Finally, Rinka burst into tears and slumps down, holding her mouth.</div><div class="calibre5">"......A-are you sure? I definitely will continue to...... cause troubles for you, Kazuto-kun......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, Bring them to me. I won't lose either." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I squat down beside Rinka and pat her head gently.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">We stare at each other's faces from a very close distance.</div><div class="calibre5">Our gazes intertwine, and my attention is focused solely on the lovely being in front of me.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto/Rinka)&nbsp;</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka/Kazuto) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> </i>😝<i class="calibre6">)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">It doesn't need any cue.</div><div class="calibre5">I put my hand on Rinka's cheek and she quietly closes her eyes and raises her chin.</div><div class="calibre5">It's obvious what we're going to do now.</div><div class="calibre5">I slowly bring my own lips close to the fresh lips before me.</div><div class="calibre5">And finally, just before our lips overlap――――――</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm home~! ......Eeh~ Here we have Kazuto-bro's shoes? Ah, maybe Kazuto-bro is coming to play!? Yaay~!" (Nonoa) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b>&nbsp;AAAAARRGH!!!! $:#((@(#-&amp;?!!!!! AGAIN, HUUUUUHHH!?!?!?!? Well, at least Nonoa-chan, NMT ~Nonoa Maji Tenshi~ comes into the page. So, you have my forgiveness, thor.)</i></span></div><div class="calibre5">.......</div><div class="calibre5">.............</div><div class="calibre5">"I thought your family wasn't coming home until this evening?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I question Rinka with half-lidded eyes.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What is the meaning of this?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"......It was supposed to......, kid is sure whimsical, after all." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I can't help it then....... Well, that's also convenient." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Convenient? What do you mean by that?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka tilts her head.</div><div class="calibre5">I chuckle lightly and say.</div><div class="calibre5">"It means we can immediately report this to Rinka's family, right? That we've officially been dating." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun......!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">She calls my name in a voice that sounds like she's overcome with emotion.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">It's very cute.......</i></div><div class="calibre5">As I'm enjoying Rinka's charm, she opens her mouth as if she has thought of something.</div><div class="calibre5">"Then, we should officially submit our marriage registration――――" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's too early for that. I'm only 17 years old. I can't get married until I'm 18." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That means it's okay next year." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Right, right, next year is okay, no way I'll say it, won't I? It'll be a scandal and your carrier would be ruined." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Don't worry. Nothing is impossible in absolute marital love." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Haa~. We're not officially married yet, you know............" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka has never wavered.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm sure she will continue to act like a wife.</div><div class="calibre5">Even though we've become lovers, my daily life still doesn't seem to be ably restoring its composure.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Aah, seriously ......huh?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I wonder, what's going to happen from now on.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka smiles happily, but I have no choice except to let out a bitter smile――――</div>
