<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; Confession</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"I love you, Kazu-kun. Please go out with me."</div><div class="calibre5">On a clear, sunny day as far as the eye can see.</div><div class="calibre5">On the rooftop of the school that is bathed in pleasant sunlight.</div><div class="calibre5">I, Ayanokouji Kazuto, am.......</div><div class="calibre5">――――<i class="calibre6">being confessed to by Kurumizaka Nana.</i></div><div class="calibre5">She has dyed her face bright red and is clasping her skirt forcefully with both hands that are trembling in shyness.</div><div class="calibre5">I can see the seriousness of her feelings in her determined eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kurumizaka-san......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't want to betray Rin-chan. but I just can't control these feelings of mine anymore......" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps she's wavering between her feelings for her precious friend or her own love interest.</div><div class="calibre5">With tears in her eyes, Kurumizaka-san lets out her true feelings.</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't care if I have to throw everything away....... So, Kazu-kun, please go out with me." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What should I do? No, I don't need to worry about it.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Because to me――――</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Kazu-kun!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">As if catching me off guard, Kurumizaka-san jumps into my chest.</div><div class="calibre5">I can't help but accept her.</div><div class="calibre5">What a soft and small body she has.</div><div class="calibre5">"What if...... Kazu-kun had met me before with Rin-chan, what would...... have happened?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"That is......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Clinging to my chest, Kurumizaka-san looks up at me with moist eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm at a loss for words in the face of such tremendous charm and fragility.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazu-kun......" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san is standing on tiptoe stretching herself and bringing her face to mine.</div><div class="calibre5">She's going to kiss me.</div><div class="calibre5">"......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I try to escape reflexively, but for some reason, my body doesn't move as if I'm paralyzed.</div><div class="calibre5">If don't do anything, my very first kiss will be robbed.</div><div class="calibre5">But I can't resist, and just as my lips are about to overlap with Kurumizaka-san's――――</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6"><b class="calibre7">Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep, Beep!</b></i></div>

<div class="calibre5">The loud sound of my alarm immediately made the world in front of me dissipate.</div><div class="calibre5">I slowly open my eyelids to see the familiar ceiling in my field of vision.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm waking up on the bed in my room.</div><div class="calibre5">"............A dream, huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Of course, obviously it is, isn't it~?</i></div><div class="calibre5">There's no way an extremely popular idol like Kurumizaka-san will fall in love with me.</div><div class="calibre5">"I wonder if this dream is also counted as an affair in Rinka's eyes......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I guess she will.</i></div><div class="calibre5">While feeling chill runs through my spine, I stop the alarm clock on my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre5">I wonder why I had such a dream of being confessed to by Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">She even tried to kiss me.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Do I subconsciously harboring such a desire......?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, it's from Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I receive a message from Rinka on my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre5">The content is a normal morning greeting message starting with <i class="calibre6">"Good morning"</i>.</div><div class="calibre5">However, this time there is a nice bonus.</div><div class="calibre5">There is attached a two-shot image of Rinka and Nonoa-chan with a big smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">"S-so cute! This's really precious.......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Okay, I'll use this as a lock screen.</i></div><div class="calibre5">Well, Rinka's face looks weird, like she failed to smile, but I don't mind it.</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, let's go to school today with high spirits~" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's already been a month since I found out that my wife in the game is Mizuki Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">I am starting to get used to the drastic changes in this daily life of mine.</div><div class="calibre5">In other words, I'm having a peaceful day.</div><div class="calibre5">It'll be nice if everything can go on without a hitch.......</div><div class="calibre5">Well, I don't think anything more than the big event of finding out that your wife in the game is actually a popular idol will happen in the future, though.</div><div class="calibre5">□</div><div class="calibre5">Now, I'm waiting for my morning homeroom.</div><div class="calibre5">As I sit in the rearmost seat by the window, I stare at the back of Rinka, who is sitting in the front row.</div><div class="calibre5">She seems to be reading a book as usual.</div><div class="calibre5">Her posture is as beautiful as ever, and her back is straight gracefully.</div><div class="calibre5">The hair that hangs down her back is really shiny, and just looking at it makes me fall to her.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......I'm getting a lot of fondness from that beautiful girl, aren't I?</i></div><div class="calibre5">It's a great fact to reconsider.</div><div class="calibre5">"I have to, settle it......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's not good to take advantage of Rinka's fondness forever.</div><div class="calibre5">I have to sort out my feelings and thoughts and give an honest answer as soon as possible.</div><div class="calibre5">"Even so, ...... am I a man worthy enough for a popular idol like her?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I was told by Kasumi-san that it was fine to stay as I was, but it didn't make me feel any better.</div><div class="calibre5">I think I'll try my best to exercise and study first.</div><div class="calibre5">It may be a good idea to try and get some kind of result and gain some confidence.</div><div class="calibre5">When I'm thinking about it while looking at Rinka's back.</div><div class="calibre5">I feel a slight vibration in my pants pocket.</div><div class="calibre5">It comes from my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre5">I take out my smartphone and check it.</div><div class="calibre5">There's a chat from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">[There's something I want to talk to you about during the lunch break today. Please come to the rooftop's landing alone.] (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">...... I wonder what it's about.</div><div class="calibre5">I suddenly remember my dream from this morning.</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san staring at me with her moist eyes, leaning into my chest and bringing her face to kiss――――.</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, no,............, what am I thinking about?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I feel guilty about Rinka, and my chest starts to sting and hurt.</div><div class="calibre5">I should not think about this.</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san is Rinka's best friend.</div><div class="calibre5">Not even delusions are allowed.</div><div class="calibre5">I reply <i class="calibre6">"Okay"</i> to her and pocketed back my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre5">I have a pretty good prediction of what Kurumizaka-san wants to talk about.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm sure it's a talk about Mizuki-san and I's befriending operation or something like that.</div><div class="calibre5">And after that...... surely she's going to ask me about how far our relationship has progressed.</div><div class="calibre5">I've been asked a few times via chat before, but I've always given vague and unclear answers.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm sure she unsatisfied with it and decides to ask me directly in real life.</div><div class="calibre5">The other day, she was grumbling <i class="calibre6">"Kazu-kun and Rin-chan won't tell me anything"</i> to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I guess I'll have to report to Rinka that I will meet Kurumizaka-san during the lunch break.</div><div class="calibre5">If she suspects me of cheating on her like before, I'll have a pit in my stomach.</div><hr class="calibre2" />
