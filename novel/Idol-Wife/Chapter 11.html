<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Changing Daily Life</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"...Hoaa~m." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Morning. I woke up in my bed at home.</div><div class="calibre5">I recognized the morning sun shining through the curtains and grabbed my phone, which I had left on my bedside table.</div><div class="calibre5">Two e-mails had come in.</div><div class="calibre5">The sender of both messages was Mizuki-san.</div><div class="calibre5">"This's unusual." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">This was the first time I've received an email in the morning.</div><div class="calibre5">Remembering what happened last night, I started to get a little nervous.</div><div class="calibre5">I tapped the screen to check the contents.</div><div class="calibre5">[Good morning, Kazuto-kun. It's another beautiful day. Don't be late, okay?] (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">......It was normal.</div><div class="calibre5">No, it wasn't normal to get a wake-up email from a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre5">The content was quite decent.</div><div class="calibre5">Then check the second one.</div><div class="calibre5">[I love you, Kazuto-kun] (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"! W-wh-wh-...-wha...!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's too straightforward!</div><div class="calibre5">My sleepiness was blown away at once.</div><div class="calibre5">I see, so this is the power of morning email......!</div><div class="calibre5">"She has never done anything like this before....... Is this because of what happened yesterday?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Maybe some kind of switch was turned on in Mizuki-san.</div><div class="calibre5">In any case, it was bad for my heart this morning.</div><div class="calibre5">"The reply... what should I do?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Do I have to reply "I love you" too?</div><div class="calibre5">"No, no, no, it's impossible! It's too embarrassing!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't know whether I like Mizuki-san or not.</div><div class="calibre5">I just had feelings of admiration and respect for her.</div><div class="calibre5">Of course, as a high school boy of my age, I had delusions of becoming her lover and having a lovey-dovey relationship with her.</div><div class="calibre5">But if you ask me if that's a romantic feeling, I'd have to tilt my head again.....</div><div class="calibre5">"......For now, I'll just reply with, Good morning, it's indeed another beautiful day." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">From the day I learned of Rin's true identity, a series of unbelievable and ridiculous events hit me.</div><div class="calibre5">My mind and heart were not in order because of the fast-changing daily life.</div><div class="calibre5">"What's going to happen to me, from now on,......? How many times exactly have I said this line?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">□</div>

<div class="calibre5">"Sup, Ayanokouji." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Good morning Ayanokouji-kun." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">As soon as I arrived at school and took my seat, the two of them immediately started talking to me.</div><div class="calibre5">Both of them had an expectant look on their faces, as if they wanted to ask me something.</div><div class="calibre5">"Good morning... and, what?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey hey, isn't the tension is low..... What happened with Mizuki?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">I knew it, after all, it was the main subject.</div><div class="calibre5">Saito was also looking at me with sparkles in his eyes behind his glasses.</div><div class="calibre5">"What happened, huh... I'm myself also wondering about it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't know where to start.</div><div class="calibre5">So, I answered vaguely.</div><div class="calibre5">If I had to give them an explanation, it would be that Mizuki-san didn't just like me, she wanted to be my wife.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a very simple explanation.</div><div class="calibre5">However, I had to be mentally prepared to give such a simple explanation.</div><div class="calibre5">As I kept my mouth shut, Tachibana narrowed his eyes and made an assertion.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ayanokouji, you..... you've been rejected!?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"You failed the name-calling challenge, didn't you!?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I haven't tried the name-calling challenge yet....." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Wait a minute, Ayanokouji-kun! Are you trying to say that you were rejected before you do the name-calling challenge!?" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">Saito said wildly as if to say, "That's ridiculous!"</div><div class="calibre5">...... And I also use it, but what is the name-calling challenge?</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, about it ... it was my bad, Ayanokouji. We really thought Mizuki really liked you ..." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"He's right. I'm sorry about it too...... I'm really sorry." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">The two apologized to me, their earlier cheerful energy dissipating.</div><div class="calibre5">I was misunderstood in the opposite sense.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mizuki rejected you after giving you so much hope, that must have lowered your spirits." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, that's not it. I'm not sure if you'll believe me even if I explain it to you....... I can't say it well either......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"You don't have to force yourself, Ayanokouji-kun. As an apology, I'll give you some of the light novels I've collected since I was in middle school." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">"Oh, in that case, I'll give you three bell peppers." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"What!? Then I'll give you five eggplants!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">"Then seven!" "Ten!" "Twelve!" "Twenty!" "Hundred!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Who are you guys, a greengrocer!? You're collecting too many vegetables, guys!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Really, these guys...!</div><div class="calibre5">As I stared at them with cold eyes, Tachibana and Saito, who had some kind of gentle expressions, put their hands on my shoulders.</div><div class="calibre5">"You're finally becoming the Ayanokouji you were meant to be." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"According to my calculation, the probability that Ayanokouji-kun is getting better is 97%. That snappy comment you just made is the best proof of that." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">...... What's wrong with these two?</div><div class="calibre5">You're not going to tell me that you've made a bad joke like an elementary school student to cheer me up?</div><div class="calibre5">"If you think about it, there's no way a popular idol like Mizuki would fall in love with Ayanokoji, who is an online game nerd." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's right. According to my calculations, there is a 79% chance that Mizuki-san saw Ayanokouji-kun as a rare animal. It was never about romantic feelings." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">"You guys are saying dαmn too much as you like....... Okay, I get it. I'll say, I'll say it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">If I was made fun of this much, I had no choice but to tell the truth.</div><div class="calibre5">Since Tachibana and Saito were listening to me, I'll tell them the truth.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mizuki-san is... she was intending to be my wife even in real life." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">""What?"" (Tachibana; Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">This is exactly what it means when one's eyes turn into dots. <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(PTW/N: 目が点になる (megatenninaru).)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5">They let out a dumb voice and blinked at each other as they looked at each other.</div><div class="calibre5">And.......</div><div class="calibre5">"Hu-huahahaha! That's not it, Ayakoji! No matter how delusional you are, it is terribly too much! Huahahaha!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Pffft! A-Ayanokouji-kun! No matter how... Pfffft!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The two were laughing with their stomachs.</div><div class="calibre5">I knew they wouldn't believe me, but I never expected them to laugh so hard.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, I guess it's normal.</div><div class="calibre5">It was really unbelievable that a popular idol, Mizuki Rinka, would not only take a liking to an online game nerd, but also consider herself to be his wife.......</div><div class="calibre5">"Phew~. I haven't laughed at that since Monday." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, I know it...... I laughed so hard I had to go to the bathroom." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre5">"M-me too. Do you want to go with us, Ayanokouji?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No way I'm going." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I wondered if I can go to the lavatory with them laughing at me like this.</div><div class="calibre5">As I sat in my chair, I watched the two giggling people leave the classroom.</div><div class="calibre5">"...Geez." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm serious here.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm not going to consult with them about anything anymore.</div><div class="calibre5">"U-umm.... Ayanokouji-kun. Is this a good time?"</div><div class="calibre5">A small girl spoke to me as if she was asking me a question fearfully.</div><div class="calibre5">It was Himekawa-san from my class.</div><div class="calibre5">With her hairstyle tied in pigtails, her overall atmosphere was reminiscent of small animals.</div><div class="calibre5">She has a rather cute appearance, but she has a reserved personality and is not the type to stand out.</div><div class="calibre5">I had the strong impression that she was in the corner of the classroom, having a conversation with her quiet friends.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's okay now. What's wrong, Himekawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-that is.... This is out of the blue, but can you pull my finger.....?" (Himekawa)</div><div class="calibre5">"finger?"</div><div class="calibre5">Himekawa-san lightly opened her small right hand into the par and held it out to me.</div><div class="calibre5">It's really out of the blue.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What is this?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"A-any one of these..." (Himekawa)</div><div class="calibre5">"For what it is?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Um, that is..." (Himekawa)</div><div class="calibre5">Himekawa-san mumbled her mouth and stammered.</div><div class="calibre5">She was shyly shaking her petite body, unable to say anything.</div><div class="calibre5">In addition, her cheeks were slightly red.</div><div class="calibre5">As I watched her, I noticed something.</div><div class="calibre5">Behind Himekawa-san.</div><div class="calibre5">One of the girls sitting in the row by the hallway was watching us with a grin on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">I guessed that I was being played some kind of game or prank on.</div><div class="calibre5">When I thought about it, I felt a slightly competitive spirit.</div><div class="calibre5">......Anyway, I guess I should choose a finger.</div><div class="calibre5">So, I lightly pulled Himekawa-san's middle finger.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah... the middle finger, huh..." (Himekawa)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh? Did I do something wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, Y-yeah. It's good..." (Himekawa)</div><div class="calibre5">Sorry? Sadness? I can't read it, but she went back to her friend, wearing some kind of negative emotion.</div><div class="calibre5">Occasionally, she skipped a glance at me and whispered to each other.</div><div class="calibre5">".....what is that?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I tilted my head, didn't understand the meaning of their actions.</div><div class="calibre5">―――― I learned this a few days later, but it seemed that I had been subjected to “finger fortune-telling”.</div><div class="calibre5">The idea was that you could tell what the other person thought of you by which finger they pulled.</div><div class="calibre5">The meaning changed depending on whether the other person was of the same sex or the opposite sex.</div><div class="calibre5">By the way, if you are pulled by the opposite sex, it means</div><div class="calibre5">・ Thumb: A trusted advisor.</div><div class="calibre5">・ Index finger: Business partner.</div><div class="calibre5">・ Middle finger: Normal friend.</div><div class="calibre5">・ Ring finger: Someone you would like to marry.</div><div class="calibre5">・ Pinky finger: Ideal lover.</div><div class="calibre5">I've heard that people think like that (It's just fortune-telling).</div><div class="calibre5">In this case, I pulled her middle finger, which means I think of Himekawa-san as a normal friend――――.</div><div class="calibre5">"... Maybe it's the first time I've ever held a girl's finger." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">An inexplicable sensation enveloped my whole body.</div><div class="calibre5">It was small and soft――――Wha!</div><div class="calibre5">I turned around as I felt killing intent.</div><div class="calibre5">It was from Mizuki-san's direction.</div><div class="calibre5">But she was touching her phone.</div><div class="calibre5">Was it my imagination?</div><div class="calibre5">Right after that, I heard a notification sound from my smartphone in my pants pocket.</div><div class="calibre5">I checked to see if it was.......</div><div class="calibre5">[It seems we do need to talk again tonight, yes?] (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I wasn't sure, but I felt like I should apologize.</div><div class="calibre5">[I'm sorry.] (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">[Today's lunch break. Please come to the back of the school so that no one can find. It’s okay if you come after you finished your lunch.] (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">[Umm, can I veto?] (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">[What a terrible husband. Your wife wants to spend lunch with you, and you're going to turn her down?] (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">We had become a couple as a matter of course.</div><div class="calibre5">[......I'll go.] (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">[Good. I've never looked forward to a lunch break so much.] (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Is it pleasure, or is it a desire that comes from black emotions? I don't know either.</div><div class="calibre5">But, it is pure joy to be invited by Mizuki-san.</div><div class="calibre5">However, this time it is.......</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm a little scared." (Kazuto)</div>
