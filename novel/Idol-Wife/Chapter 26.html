<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; The Cool Idol's Closet</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"Whew...... that felt so good." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">After finishing my dubious lunch, I excuse to Rinka to the bathroom.</div><div class="calibre5">Let me tell you something.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't come here to throw up.</div><div class="calibre5">I just wanted to do a little thing.</div><div class="calibre5">I come out of the bathroom and wash my hands in the washroom.</div><div class="calibre5">And when I want to return to Rinka, my smartphone rings.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">...... How many times have been today?</i></div><div class="calibre5">Sorry to say, but your advice is completely useless, Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Well, I can't just ignore her............. Hello?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Ah, Kazu-kun. What's going on there now?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I just finished a bowl of fried rice that had something special in it."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Something special, what is it?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I want to know about it....... No, I definitely don't want to know."</i>&nbsp;(Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Once you know, there may be no turning back.</div><div class="calibre5">Let's just remember it as the fried rice that was dαmn so good.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"What are you going to do now?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Right....... I don't feel like going out right now, so I might just stay in this room."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"No waay~. How long do I have to stay behind the telephone pole?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Why don't you just go home already? You're not doing anything there, are you?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Uuu. I want to do something that will make Rin-chan happy, even if only a little. Please cooperate with me."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"...... I've been wanting to ask you this for a while now, why do you work so hard for the sake of Rinka, Kurumizaka-san?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"That is......"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"You do it not just as a friend. And It's not just for fun either."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"......"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">A heavy silence drifted from my phone.</div><div class="calibre5">After all, there seems to be something.</div><div class="calibre5">I've been feeling the desperation in the actions of Kurumizaka-san for some time now.</div><div class="calibre5">No matter how much energy she has, it's too much.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Well, if that's her personality, I can't say anything about it.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Actually, I'm the one who invited Rin-chan to be an idol."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"So that's it, huh."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Yes....... But you know, I made Rin-chan go through a very difficult time."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"It's not your fault, Kurumizaka-san. Besides, you two are successful now."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"That's not true. If it weren't for Kazu-kun, I'm sure Rin-chan would have been broken. I feel that all the responsibilities are on me....... I made Rin-chan suffer a lot by getting her involved in order to make my own dreams come true."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">It's not her usual cheerful tone of voice.</div><div class="calibre5">I can feel the guilt painfully coming from the painful words of Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know the past of the two.</div><div class="calibre5">A few weeks ago, I had asked Rinka about when she started working as an idol.</div><div class="calibre5">But Rinka blatantly muddled the subject and diverted it to another topic.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Even I, who is dull, can tell.</i></div><div class="calibre5">It must be a past that she doesn't want to be touched.</div><div class="calibre5">And it's the same for Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"So, if it's for Rin-chan's sake, then I'll――――"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah! That's Kurumizaka Nana-chan over there, right?"</div><div class="calibre5">"You're right! Gosh, she's real! ......Why are you dressed like a prowler?"</div><div class="calibre5">Voices that seem to be that of ordinary women are heard.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that Kurumizaka-san's identity has been exposed.</div><div class="calibre5">"Nana-chan! I'm a fan of yours! Please shake my hand!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Eeeh!? N-no, that is...... Ahahaha." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Why are you dressed all in black? Are you returning from some kind of event?"</div><div class="calibre5">An ordinary female fan seems unable to stop her excitement.</div><div class="calibre5">Of course, she does.</div><div class="calibre5">She's met the center of the most popular idol group in the world, after all.</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh, Nana-chan's here?"</div><div class="calibre5">"I heard that Kurumizaka Nana of StarMines is sneaking around behind a telephone pole!"</div><div class="calibre5">The commotion is getting worse and worse.</div><div class="calibre5">The voices coming from my phone are getting louder and louder.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Kurumizaka-san, are you okay?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Haha, thanks for the support~............. <i class="calibre6">I think I'm a little not okay.</i>" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I don't know what I can do, but should I go help you?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"No. Kazu-kun, you stay with Rin-chan."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"But......"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I'm fine! Please take care of Rin-chan, yes!"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre7"><i class="calibre6">Beep!♪</i></b></div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I stare at my smartphone, which has been disconnected, and I'm enveloped in an indescribable feeling.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kurumizaka-san...... she didn't give me decent advice until the very end." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Well, let's hope she can get over the fuss safely.　</div><div class="calibre5">That's all I can do.</div><div class="calibre5">□</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry to make you wait. Is there anything you want to do?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I come to Rinka's room and ask her who is sitting on her bed.</div><div class="calibre5">"I want to do, yes? .......I don't mind anything as long as I can be with Kazuto-kun......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I see......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She says it in such a direct way that I feel embarrassed by just hear it.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">If we're officially lovers, what should we do in these situations?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......After all, is it such a thing or that thing?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I'm so focused on planning outside that I haven't thought about the pattern if we move into a home date.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll be frank with you. I want to make out with you, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's too frank ......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Even though she'd get blushed if I held her hand, yet she's just amazing with her statements.</div><div class="calibre5">I thought, but Rinka's cheeks had faintly dyed in cherry blossom.</div><div class="calibre5">Even so, it does not break the cool atmosphere she has.</div><div class="calibre5">"'Kazuto-kun, you feel the same way I do, don't you? Even though it was Nana's suggestion, you invited me on a date." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......So you know it, huh." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Rather than 'knowing', I think 'noticing' is the right word. And besides, Nana was following us around in a strange outfit." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Everything seemed to be completely seen through.</div><div class="calibre5">I tend to forget this because of her usual wifely behavior, but the original Rinka is a cool idol who behaves coolly and perfectly.</div><div class="calibre5">It's hard to fool Rinka's eyes with just me and Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">"Probably, that you brought me to your home to get slipped of Kurumizaka-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's also one of it. I want Kazuto-kun to eat my home-cooked food, besides, there was no way could concentrate on the date if Nana was following around in that weird outfit." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Indeed." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It'd have been nice if, including Nana, the three of us could have hung out together, but ............ I'm sure that's not what you two are after, right." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">How far are you seeing through?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">This cool idol, scary......!</i></div><div class="calibre5">"That's why Kazuto-kun...... Do you want to do something like a married couple?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, with her enchanting eyes, gets up from the bed and leans against my chest.</div>

<div class="calibre5">She's as aggressive as ever when it comes to attacking.</div><div class="calibre5">But I haven't confessed my love to her yet.</div><div class="calibre5">"That's right, Rinka! I've been wanting to ask you something for a while." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... What do you want to ask?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka's lips pouted in annoyance at being interrupted.</div><div class="calibre5">The slightly grumpy look on his face is also cute.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Then, what should I do?</i></div><div class="calibre5">It was something I had said to get the place back on track, but in reality, there was not a single thing I wanted to ask.</div><div class="calibre5">Is there, or is there not...... no, there is one.</div><div class="calibre5">I decided to ask the questions I had when I came to this room before.</div><div class="calibre5">"Rinka. What's in that closet?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Why...... are you asking me that?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"The other day, when Nonoa-chan came home, you made me hide on the bed, right? But if you really don't want me to be found out, wouldn't it be better to hide me in the closet?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">In the end, I was exposed by my shoes, but the closet was the only place I could find a suitable place to hide.</div><div class="calibre5">An intelligent girl like Rinka must understand this.</div><div class="calibre5">"The reason why did you go to the trouble of pushing me onto bed...... I was just wondering if there was anything in the closet." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"............ There, was. As Kazuto-kun is looking at, I have something hidden in the closet." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Have something?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eerm." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka nods with a mysterious look on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">"It bothers me when you say it like that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... I don't want to show it too much. If I show it to Kazuto-kun, he'll definitely think I'm a weird girl." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's not true. I'll accept whatever Rinka is doing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Really?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I nod confidently to Rinka, who is anxious to confirm.</div><div class="calibre5">"... I understand. I'll show you." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka walks away from me and heads towards the closet.</div><div class="calibre5">She puts her hand on the handle of the closet, glances at me once, and hesitantly opens it.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The clothes in the closet are gorgeous, ranging from casual clothes to idol costumes.</div><div class="calibre5">There is nothing wrong inside.......</div><div class="calibre5">Wait, there are four felt dolls underneath.</div><div class="calibre5">They're slightly smaller than a human head.</div><div class="calibre5">The felt dolls look familiar to me.</div><div class="calibre5">No, it's not just that they look familiar.</div><div class="calibre5">If you look in the mirror, you will always see the reflection of.......</div><div class="calibre5">Yes, that's me.</div><div class="calibre5">There are four cute deformed felt dolls of Ayanokouji Kazuto――――sitting proudly in Rinka's closet.</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-these are......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun dolls." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I remain silent as I look at the four adorably made Kazuto-kun dolls.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Are they made by Rinka herself?</i></div><div class="calibre5">Even though I am the subject, I can tell that they really well made.</div><div class="calibre5">"That's, you know. I always hug my Kazuto-kun doll whenever I go to bed......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"O-oh." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Recently, The desire to be wrapped up in more Kazuto-kun dolls has been developing............. Even Kazuto-kun, as expected, will be repulsed, right?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka asks me fearfully, her face is red and she looks embarrassed as she's fidgeting with her left and right hands intertwined.</div>
