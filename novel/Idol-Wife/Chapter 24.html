<div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I've been walking around town hand in hand with Rinka since a while ago, but we have been in silence which is a bit sweet and sour.</div><div class="calibre5">This is because Rinka is not saying a single word.</div><div class="calibre5">I can tell that she's embarrassed because her face, which I can see through the mask, is stained red.</div><div class="calibre5">She usually says that she isn't ashamed saying <i class="calibre6">'stuff becoming wife'</i>, but it seems that she becomes a innocent maiden just by holding hands with me.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Is this really an atmosphere for a date?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I may have been too aggressive from the very beginning.</div><div class="calibre5">Also, I can feel eyes on me from behind.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't have to look back to know who it is.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm pretty sure it's Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5">Somehow I have a feeling that she's grinning.</div><div class="calibre5">"Say, Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Wh-what is it......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm going to ask you straight out, are you okay? If this's too much for you, you don't have to strain yourself, you know." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I'm fine. I probably have been waiting for this day for a few years. Ever since I was playing with Kazu in the game......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka mutters sincerely, as if she was chewing on her current happiness.</div><div class="calibre5">If that's what she says, then I'm not going to say anything.</div><div class="calibre5">It's fun even if you don't talk about anything.</div><div class="calibre5">I'll be happy to just walk around with her, admiring the city, but it'll also be a shame to end the date just with that.</div><div class="calibre5">Looking at the time, we decide to go to a store.</div><div class="calibre5">It's almost time for the stores to start getting crowded, so we should head for the caf√© we've been eyeing.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, Kazuto-kun. Is that child okay?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I look in the direction that Rinka pointed.</div><div class="calibre5">A little girl is standing at the edge of the sidewalk, looking anxious.</div><div class="calibre5">Judging by her figure, she is probably no more than an elementary school student.</div><div class="calibre5">"I have a feeling that......she's a lost child. She was separated from his parents and didn't know what to do." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"When you put it that way, it does seem that way." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She isn't crying, so she isn't attracting attention.</div><div class="calibre5">The people around her pass by without paying any attention to the lost girl.</div><div class="calibre5">"Do you mind if I go talk to her for a minute? If she's not lost, I'll be right back." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"No problem. I mean, I'm coming with you too." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">If she's really lost, we can't just leave her there.</div><div class="calibre5">We went to the girl who's standing there in a daze.</div><div class="calibre5">"May I have a minute?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......?"</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka crouches down to meet the child's gaze and calls her out.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry for talking to you out of the blue. I was worried that you might be lost." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......"</div><div class="calibre5">The child seems to be wary, looks at Rinka in the eyes, and fell silent.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, it can't be helped.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka is now wearing a full set of disguising gear including a hat, glasses, and mask.</div><div class="calibre5">It's no wonder she looks a little suspicious.</div><div class="calibre5">"Or are you waiting for someone?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Mommy is, lost."</div><div class="calibre5">"Mommy, yes?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">The girl nods her head.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that in this child's mind, her mother is the one who is lost.</div><div class="calibre5">I almost giggle.</div><div class="calibre5">"So......, when did your mother get lost?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"A while ago."</div><div class="calibre5">"So that's it......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka nods gently as she stands up.</div><div class="calibre5">She shows a slight gesture of distress and speaks to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun, should we take her to the police station?." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's see. If it was just a while ago, I'm sure her mother will come looking for her, so it'd be better if we wait here." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's better to wait at the point where the child got lost than to take her around.</div><div class="calibre5">The police station will be the last resort.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mommy had.... told me to wait there and not follow anyone when I got separated from her."</div><div class="calibre5">"I see. Then let's do this. Wait here for a while, and if mommy doesn't come for you, we'll go to the police station then. Are you okay with it?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......"</div><div class="calibre5">After a few seconds of silence, the lost girl gives a small nod.</div><div class="calibre5">"Is that okay with you, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">We decide to wait until his mother came to pick her up, just in case.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a reasonable decision.</div><div class="calibre5">I take a quick look around.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't see anyone who looks like this kid's parents.</div><div class="calibre5">Most of the people walking around are young people.</div><div class="calibre5">There are also some families............. Ah, There's Kurumizaka-san who is hiding behind a telephone pole.</div><div class="calibre5">She's completely seen through.</div><div class="calibre5">As I watch in amazement, she takes her smartphone out of her pocket and starts to make a call.</div><div class="calibre5">Sure enough, my smartphone starts ringing.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry, Rinka. I just got a call." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I understand......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I pick up the phone, keeping a little distance from Rinka, who stares at me suspiciously.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"What is it, Kurumizaka-san?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Kazu-kun, what's going on?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"She's lost. She's waiting for her mother to come back."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"That sounds terrible. But you're on a date, remember?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Even if you say that......., I can't just leave her alone. Rinka also seems to feel the same way."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"...... You're both so kind, yes~."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"It's normal, isn't it."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's nothing special.</div><div class="calibre5">I look at the girls as I make the call.</div><div class="calibre5">In this short time, Rinka seems to have loosened the girl's alertness.</div><div class="calibre5">The girl is conversing with Rinka with a relaxed expression on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you his lover, sister?"</div><div class="calibre5">"No, we are not lovers, you know? We are a couple. I am Kazuto-kun's wife." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Rinka-san?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What are you trying to infusing a young child?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Wooooow. Have you kissed him yet?"</div><div class="calibre5">"......O-of course.......!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"How many times did you do it?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-that is already...... uncountable......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka shakes her voice subtly.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Why are you acting so tough there......</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">You were able to answer that we were husband and wife before, yet you weren't able to answer that you had never kissed?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Do you already have a child?"</div><div class="calibre5">"No, not yet. But ideally, I would like to have about <b class="calibre7">ten</b>." (Rinka) <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> oww boiii~, it's a sign that you have to do more exercises and stamina trainings~)</span></i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">That's a lot! Isn't it already like a baseball team!</i></div><div class="calibre5">It seems Rinka wants a big family.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......That reminds me, Mikio Papa has ever told me about it.</i></div><div class="calibre5">He said that his wife had always been clinging to him all the time every day and that he felt exhausted in the morning.</div><div class="calibre5">To put it more bluntly, for a sophomore high schooler, Rinka, having a little sister, Nonoa-chan, who is a first-grader,</div><div class="calibre5">It means that...... her parents are still in <i class="calibre6">great spirits</i> at night</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"What's wrong Kazu-kun. Are you listening to my befriending strategy?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"...... I'll choose a job that requires a lot of business trips."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"What's wrong with you all of a sudden? Your voice sounds distant somehow."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"It's nice to be desired, but too much of it can kill a man."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I don't know what you're talking about, but I can tell it's very heavy."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm flattered, but there is a limit.</div><div class="calibre5">That a man is.</div><div class="calibre5">I feel like I understand Mikio Papa's struggle a little better now.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I'll hang up the phone then."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Okay. Good luck then."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">I hang up the phone and pocket it.</div><div class="calibre5">I return to Rinka and the little girl.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hey, big bro."</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm, what's it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Is it true that after you married big sis, you went deep into the dungeons to stop the Grand Priest from destroying the world instead of going on a honeymoon? And then defeating the Evil God by just you two?"</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">That's the story of the game.</div><div class="calibre5">But for a child of less than elementary school age, everything Œ±dults say seems to be true.</div><div class="calibre5">The lost girl is looking at me with a sparkling look of admiration.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Seriously, Rinka-san, what have you been infusing to her......</i></div><div class="calibre5">‚ñ°</div>

<div class="calibre5">"I'm really thankful to you."</div><div class="calibre5">"Bye-bye."</div><div class="calibre5">A few minutes later, her mother came to pick her up.</div><div class="calibre5">The girl, being pulled by her mother, smiles and waved at us cheerfully as she leaves.</div><div class="calibre5">It's good to be a parent and a child, yeah.</div><div class="calibre5">"Children are wonderful, yes." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-I guess so." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"What's wrong, Kazuto-kun? Your cheeks are tight." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's probably just your imagination." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I like children, but I want a limit on the number of children.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I earnestly hope so in my heart.</div><div class="calibre5">"What do you want to do after this, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What I want to do, huh. I was planning to go to a popular caf√© or something like that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"But at this time, all the stores seem to be crowded." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, I guess so......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">The plan is screwed up.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't think it's the lost girl's fault in the slightest, but I should have thought about making a reservation at a store if this was going to happen.</div><div class="calibre5">However, The me who is a <i class="calibre6">'Nerd Gamer'</i> and not even a beginner at love, of course, there's no way I can't arrange a perfect plan for us.</div><div class="calibre5">It can't be helped then, at a time like this, I need to rely on Guru Kurumizaka.</div><div class="calibre5">"Umm, Kazuto-kun. If you're fine......why don't you come to my house?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sure there are some ingredients left in the fridge at home, and no one will be home until this evening....... How it sounds to you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"T-then, please." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eeerm......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka seems to be nervous.</div><div class="calibre5">I can feel her nervousness and it makes me feel weird.</div><div class="calibre5">I visited her house only once before, but the situation now is different from that time.</div><div class="calibre5">Moreover, the conversation we just had (about the kids) is still lingering in my mind, and I'm starting to have some naughty thoughts.</div><div class="calibre5">This is not good.</div><div class="calibre5">It's healthy, but it's also not.</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Kazuto-kun, let's go." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I quietly follow Rinka who holds my hand somewhat shyly.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Kurumizaka-san...... What should I do?</i></div>
