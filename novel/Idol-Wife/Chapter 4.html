<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Sign and Glimpse</h3>

<div>"I've never seen Rin-chan having lunch with a boy~" (Nana)</div><div>"It's the first time in fact. I was a little weak with men." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san sit next to Mizuki-san.</div><div>As expected, having two popular idols gathered in one place attracted a lot of attention from the people around.</div><div>I could hear them whispering to each other.</div><div>I didn't want to stand out, so I kept quiet and concentrated on keeping my presence to an absolute minimum.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But You're not afraid with Ayanokouji-kun?" (Nana)</div><div>"I'm not... In fact, it's the opposite. This is the first time I've talked to him in real life, but we've known each other for a long time online." (Rinka)</div><div>"Hee~ ... oh, maybe this person is Kazu-kun!?" (Nana)</div><div>"He is." (Rinka)</div><div>"So that is it! Waaa, being able to talk to Kazu-kun in person is really exciting!" (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san, who was making her eyes glitter, expresses her joy as if she's in front of a celebrity.</div><div><i>......What kind of an online game nerd is appreciated by an idol?</i></div><div>Thinking so, I opened my mouth.</div><div><br /></div><div>"You know me." (Kazuto)</div><div>"Yea. I've heard a lot about you from Rin-chan. You're a very attractive boy, aren't you?" (Nana)</div><div>"No, even if you ask me..." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>If I nodded here, it'll be really really embarrassing.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Nana. Please don't bother Kazuto-kun too much." (Rinka)</div><div>"Eh? I want to hear more from Kazu-kun. I'm really curious about what Rin-chan looks like on the internet!" (Nana)</div><div>"It's not so different from real life." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Lie, it's totally different!</i></div><div><i>If anything, your personalities are complete opposites!</i></div><div><br /></div><div>I think the <i>Rin</i> on the internet is more like Kurumizaka-san than Mizuki-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>"How nice~. To have a boy that gets along with so well and even marry him in-game." (Nana)</div><div>"Nana talks with boys too, don't you?" (Rinka)</div><div>"I do, but it just a mere talk, though. I wonder if there's a boy who is close enough to be my friend." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>She said regretfully, and plopped down on the table.</div><div>If she wants to, she could easily build a reverse harem, let alone a friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I wish I could have a friend like Kazu-kun." (Nana)</div><div>"It's difficult. There are many strange people on the internet as well as in the real world." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>After saying that, Mizuki-san resumed eating.</div><div>Watching from the side, Kurumizaka-san spoke to me.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I don't really know what to say right now,....... but I really thank you, Kazu-kun." (Nana)</div><div>"For what?" (Kazuto)</div><div>"For the fact that you've been supporting Rin-chan throughout the years. Rin-chan is fine now, but at one point I was so worried about her that she was pushing herself too hard......." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>So that was it.</div><div>No, if I thought back to the past, I could think of a few things.</div><div>Bad to say, but there was a time when Rin was emotionally unstable while online.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Nana. Please stop talking about that in front of him... It's embarrassing." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>Mizuki-san muttered as she dyed her cheeks red.</div><div><i>......She's so cute.</i></div><div><i>Why the h*ll is a girl's blush dÎ±mn so attractive?</i></div><div><br />

</div><div>"Hey hey. Can I join the game next time? Ah,&nbsp; Is it okay if I bother you...." (Nana)</div><div>"I don't mind. I mean, you've asked me before, haven't you?" (Rinka)</div><div>"T-that's... I've always had a scary image of online games, so I couldn't get myself into them......" (Nana)</div><div>"It's okay. Certainly there are some insolent people who don't follow etiquette, but not everyone is like that. Even if something happens, I and Kazuto-kun will protect you." (Rinka)</div><div>"Thank you Rin-chan! Then, what should I do first?" (Nana)</div><div>"I'll tell you what. First, open the official website from your computer and play the game&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div>As Mizuki-san explained matter-of-factly, Kurumizaka-san nodded her head in understanding.</div><div><i>I don't think it's possible, but are the three of us going to play online game together?</i></div><div><i>Two idols and me alone?</i></div><div>What should I do, I was so nervous that I feel like I'm going to cry just by imagining it.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Hey, Rin-chan. I can't understand if you just saying it, so please come to my house and teach me." (Nana)</div><div>"I wonder where all my hard work of struggling to explain went..... Oh well, it'll be quicker that way." (Rinka)</div><div>"Ahaha, Sorry Rin-chan. But I'm looking forward to it now. I can't believe we, three of us can play together with that Kazu-kun." (Nana).</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Which Kazu-kun is 'that Kazu-kun'?</i></div><div>I'm curious as to what kind of evaluation is actually being made between the two of them.</div><div>But I didn't have the guts to ask.</div><div>I mean, I couldn't even able to enter into their conversation.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rin-chan and Kazu-kun are very close friends on the Internet, aren't they?" (Nana)</div><div>"Yup yup, we are so close that the word <i>"close"</i> doesn't even begin to cover it." (Rinka)</div><div>"How nice. Then you guys can get along well in real life too, yes?" (Nana)</div><div>"Yup." (Rinka).</div><div><br /></div><div>Mizuki-san nodded her head in satisfaction.</div><div>And she happily loosened her cheeks and continued her words.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br />

</div><div><br /></div><div>"&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213; From now on, we can stay together even in real life too." (Rinka)</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>....</div><div>..........?</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What do you mean by that?</i></div><div>In the midst of my tilting my head, my eyes suddenly met with Kurumizaka-san's.</div><div>She also seemed to have a question mark above her head.</div><div>Mizuki-san, oblivious to us, proceeded to eat quietly.</div><div>In an instant, silence took over the place, and I remembered the hustle and bustle in the cafeteria to my ears.</div><div><br /></div><div>"A-ah... I'll be off. Because my friends are waiting for me in the classroom." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san stood up with some awkwardness.</div><div><br /></div><div>"That so. Then, see you again after school." (Rinka)</div><div>"Yeah. Let's do our best in today's lesson." (Nana)</div><div><br /></div><div>Kurumizaka-san concluded with a smile and walked to the doorway of the cafeteria.</div><div>She looked back only once on the way, smiled lightly at us, and then left.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>At that time, I had no clue what that smile meant.......</div><div><i>Nor</i> did I have any idea.</div>
