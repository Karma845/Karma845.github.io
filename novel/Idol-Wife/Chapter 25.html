<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; It's Love, Isn't?</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun. I'm going to prepare the lunch now, so just relax in the living room, kay." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm led to the living room, and Rinka urges me to sit on the couch.</div><div class="calibre5">This is the second time I've come to this house.</div><div class="calibre5">The whole room smells so good.</div><div class="calibre5">"You can turn on the TV if you want." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka, standing in the kitchen, tells me so.</div><div class="calibre5">She has her hair in a ponytail and is wearing an apron, just like before.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What a pretty precious sight, there.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"......For now, let's turn on the TV." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I pick up the remote control on the table in front of me and turn on the TV.</div><div class="calibre5">A daytime variety show is on.</div><div class="calibre5">Moreover, the show is featuring idols, and there is a conversation going on about <b class="calibre7">Star☆Mines</b>.</div><div class="calibre5">The idol group that keeps evolving and progressing with the tremendous energy of Kurumizaka-san as its center...... and so on.</div><div class="calibre5">There's also an evaluation of Mizuki Rinka as a girl who can be called a diva.</div><div class="calibre5">"After all, they are amazing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Can you believe it?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I play online games with these girls every days off, you know?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">And even now, now I'm coming over to Rinka's house.</i></div><div class="calibre5">"......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I pick my smartphone up as I receive a call from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Hello, Kurumizaka-san?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Ah, Did you decide to have lunch at Rin-chan's house?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Yeah. What are you going to do for lunch, Kurumizaka-san?"</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"What should I do, yes........ I'd like to eat Rin-chan's home-cooked food too, so can you somehow deliver it to me?"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Of course I can't......."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She didn't say it in a joking tone.</div><div class="calibre5">But rather, in a serious one.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I'm hungry, .......Right now, I'm looking up at Rin-chan's room from behind a telephone pole with binoculars."</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Are you dressed all in black? You'd better stop it, because you will definitely get reported."</i> (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's been almost a month since I've known Kurumizaka-san for whatever reason.</div><div class="calibre5">I've come to understand her to some extent.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not that she's ruining her image on TV, but she's going in a bit of a weird direction.</div><div class="calibre5">For better or worse, she's energetic and foolhardy.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"I'm gonna the convenience store to get some Anpan and milk!"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"You should go home, really......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Then, See yaa~!"</i> (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">She ends the talk with an unnecessarily cheerful voice and hangs up the call.</div><div class="calibre5">......Well, she seems like a good match for the cool type of Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">A few minutes later, Rinka calls me for lunch.</div><div class="calibre5">I get up from the couch and take a seat at the dining room table.</div><div class="calibre5">When I first look at the table, I find that a bowl of mouthwatering fried rice has been prepared.</div><div class="calibre5">It has a savory smell that makes my stomach growl.</div><div class="calibre5">Carefully chopped green onions and boiled pork were mixed in, and the overall color of the dish, including the rice, is wonderful.</div><div class="calibre5">If it's only for its appearance, it'll be on par with what is served in restaurants.</div><div class="calibre5">"This is amazing, Rinka. Absolutely this will be so delicious." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course. I've loved cooking since I was a kid, so I'm pretty confident in my abilities." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka says it without any modesty.</div><div class="calibre5">This dignified behavior is something only a cool idol can do.</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly, Rinka sits down next to me with her own bowl of fried rice.</div><div class="calibre5">She seems to want to eat next to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's eat, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yeah....... Let's dig in." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">After putting my hands together, I take the prepared spoon in my right hand and scoop up a bite of the dome-shaped fried rice.</div><div class="calibre5">Bring it to my mouth and chew.......</div><div class="calibre5">"So delicious......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I'm not a gourmet food critic, so I can't describe exactly how really delicious it is.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">It's just dαmn so delicious.</i></div><div class="calibre5">That's all I can say.</div><div class="calibre5">This's the first time I have eaten a girl's home cooking.</div><div class="calibre5">Even if it was burnt to char, I'll have definitely enjoyed it.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm glad. It seems to have suited your palate." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"It's really delicious. It's the best fried rice I've ever had." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Fufu....... Actually, I've put something special in that fried rice." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... something special?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I stop the spoon and look at Rinka's face.</div><div class="calibre5">For some reason, she has a suspicious smile on her face and her eyes were glowing.</div><div class="calibre5">"Yup, something special. Fufu." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">...... Is this fried rice okay to eat?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I guess it's just a matter of feeling, but I suddenly feel like my stomach is starting to feel sick.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">N-no, no.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">There's nothing weird in it.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Probably I just want her to say something cute like "it's a love~"!</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">That must be it!</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">No, please let it be true!</i></div><div class="calibre5">"What's wrong, Kazuto-kun? Aren't you going to eat?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, yeah......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll give you mine if you want." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I can't let you do that. Rinka has to eat well too." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't mind. I'm happy just to see you eating deliciously, Kazuto-kun........" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka smiles, looking truly happy.</div><div class="calibre5">I have no choice but to eat it.</div><div class="calibre5">I shake off the bad premonition that is sticking in my brain and continue to bring Rinka's special fried rice to my mouth.</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre7"><i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">A/N: That "something special" does not contain any materials that are harmful to the health.
