<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; The Energetic Idol, Kurumizaka Nana</h3>

<div class="calibre5">Lunch break arrives without incident.</div><div class="calibre5">In response to Kurumizaka-san's call, I come to the rooftop landing.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kurumizaka-san is......not here yet, huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Maybe I'm a little too hasty.</div><div class="calibre5">I sit down on the stairs and wait for Kurumizaka-san to arrive.</div><div class="calibre5">I think I'd read a web novel while I wait for her.</div><div class="calibre5">Just as I take out my phone, I hear footsteps coming up the stairs.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, Kazu-kun. Sorry~. Did I make you wait?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, I just got here." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">A cheerful smile appeares on Kurumizaka-san's face.</div><div class="calibre5">She's sweating slightly.</div><div class="calibre5">She also seems to have come here in a hurry.</div><div class="calibre5">"I told Rinka that we're going to meet, was that okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, it was okay. I'm also afraid that Rin-chan will be angry with me." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">The way she said it, sounds like she's been through this a few times.</div><div class="calibre5">Then, Kurumizaka-san immediately asks me.</div><div class="calibre5">"So, Kazu-kun. How far have you and Rin-chan progressed? I'm very curious because neither of you has told me anything at all!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"It as I said on the smartphone, we're getting reasonably close." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"What do you mean by <i class="calibre6">"reasonably close"</i>? It's too vague, Kazu-kun!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">She seems to want to know more about our relationship.</div><div class="calibre5">She approaches me with excitement.</div><div class="calibre5">Not good, I'm starting to remember and become conscious of the dream I have this morning.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry, but I'll be in trouble if you get too close to me......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm, why? Ah,...... do I smell?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, you don't. You smell great as usual." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"......The way you said it sounds like a pervert." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san stares at me with half-lidded eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">I guess I have made a mistake in my choice of words.</div><div class="calibre5">"You went to Rin-chan's house last week, didn't you?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"How do you know?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Kasumi-san reported it to me!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Seriously? I don't know that they had a connection......</i></div><div class="calibre5">No, it won't be strange if they had.</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka and Kurumizaka-san seem to have been getting along for a long time, and it's not strange if Kurumizaka-san and Kasumi-san get along as well.</div><div class="calibre5">"If so, I think you should ask Kasumi-san ......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eeeeh, Why I should to when I can directly ask the person in question anyway?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't know if I can understand what you mean, but....... It's embarrassing if I tell you myself." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"As the commander of Kazu-kun and Rin-chan's befriending operation, so I have to keep track of their relationship! Now, come tell me!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"You're really getting into it, yes......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I've heard that girls love to hear about other people's love lives, and it seems that this popular idol, Kurumizaka Nana, is no exception.</div><div class="calibre5">I decide to tell her about my day at the Mizuki's home.</div><div class="calibre5">Starting with the younger sister, Nonoa-chan, getting tangled up with the eldest sister, Kasumi-san, about the drunken mother who just coming home.</div><div class="calibre5">Most importantly, I must not forget Mikio Papa.</div><div class="calibre5">Mikio Papa left a strong impression on me, both for better and worse.</div><div class="calibre5">In the end, I wondered what he was trying to tell me.</div><div class="calibre5">After I finish telling everything, Kurumizaka-san, who has been nodding her head enthusiastically, speaks up with a straight face.</div><div class="calibre5">"You've been getting all the family members approvals. So, why you two aren't dating yet?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ugh!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Do you not see Rin-chan as a girl, Kazu-kun?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, that's not the case." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I see her as a very very attractive girl.</div><div class="calibre5">Even if she is a bit odd girl who tried to act like a wife in real life.</div><div class="calibre5">"Speaking of which, did you two ever go on a date?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">".......No, we haven't, We're even not officially dating yet." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Even so, it'll be nice to go have fun with her at least once, won't it?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"We're always having fun a lot together in the online game." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's not what I mean....... You know what I mean about, right?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She raises her eyebrows a little and gives me a threatening look.</div><div class="calibre5">However, because her original face is too cute, I don't feel scared, but more feel fascinated.</div><div class="calibre5">It's like a tiny squirrel trying its best to intimidate you.</div><div class="calibre5">"Okay, it's decided. Next time, the two of you have to go out together." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Are you serious? Wouldn't it cause an uproar if people around found out? What if someone takes a picture and spread it on social media...." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm, it'll be fine in disguise then." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Wouldn't they still able to recognize even if in disguise? The aura of a popular idol is not something that can be easily concealed, Rinka and Kurumozaka-san shine brightly." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahaha, You're exaggerating, Kazu-kun. We're just ordinary girls, you know." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">You're absolutely not ordinary, you know.</i></div><div class="calibre5">It's not that she's being modest, but she seems to be saying it from the bottom of her heart.</div><div class="calibre5">I guess this sarcastic feeling is the secret to her popularity.</div><div class="calibre5">Her cheerfulness and friendliness made it easy for me to interact with her as a normal person.</div><div class="calibre5">"Surprisingly, if you wear a hat, glasses, and a mask, you won't be recognized. Also, it's important to change your atmosphere. It's pretty hard to put into words, but more or less it's like that." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">It's the so-called <b class="calibre7">"price of fame"</b>, huh.</i></div><div class="calibre5">Seems like being idols make them have hard times spending their daily life.</div><div class="calibre5">"This week and next week are...... I'm afraid our schedule is full. If we can have a day off, I'll let Kazu know, so you have to invite Rin-chan that time then!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Even if you say that...... I've never gone out with any girl before, so I don't know what I've to do." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Just leave it to me! I'll follow you to make sure your date goes well!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san responds confidently while putting her hand on her chest.</div><div class="calibre5">Her brÎµasts are rather large, so I have it hard where I have to look.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Has Kurumizaka-san ever been to go out with boys?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Haven't?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Whaaat......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't think I can rely on someone who has no experience.</div><div class="calibre5">When I'm feeling skeptical, Kurumizaka-san, who seems to have sensed that my inner feelings, hurriedly made an excuse.</div><div class="calibre5">"D-don't worry! I watch a lot of romantic dramas and movies! Also, I even like romantic comedy anime!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"......So?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"That is..., I don't have any experience, but I think I have a lot of.............knowledge." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Can that knowledge be applied to real life?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I-it can, maybe....... During the other night, I was able to complete a game where boys get along with each other in one night." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"Isn't that a BL game? That's not helpful at all. Moreover, you've been up all overnight just to clear it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Unimaginable, but Kurumozaka-san is such a person.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Well, I don't mind it, though.</i></div><div class="calibre5">Everyone has their own hobbies and interests.</div><div class="calibre5">But there's no such information written in her official profile.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">So, she's hiding it, huh?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"D-don't concern yourself with me. Kazu-kun, you're going to do your best to respond to Rin-chan's feelings, ain't you? You said you wanted to face Rin-chan in real life too, didn't you?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">".......I've indeed told that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"You can at least go on a date with her then, am I right?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san has crushed my escape route just as a counterattack.</div><div class="calibre5">What a terrifying idol she is.</div><div class="calibre5">Whether it is for the sake of disguising her interest or for her best friend Rinka, she's aggressively pushing me.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">...... No, it's not good for me to keep dithering.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">I still can't make a decision even after all this supports from the people around me.......</i></div><div class="calibre5">"I think you don't have to think too hard of it. Do you hate the idea of having fun with Rin-chan?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"No...... I don't hate it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm glad. ...... Oh, it's almost time. I have to get back to class." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">"You're right." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Then I'll contact you if we have a day off!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre5">Kurumizaka-san smiles in relief and waves at me before walking down the stairs.</div><div class="calibre5">The sound of her light footsteps echoing off the walls as she moves away.</div><div class="calibre5">She really is an energetic girl.</div><div class="calibre5">She is a caring person, or rather, she is straightforward to her goals.......</div><div class="calibre5">"Why is Kurumizaka-san working so hard for the sake of Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">She's not just meddling.</div><div class="calibre5">She had previously said she wanted Rinka to be happy.</div><div class="calibre5">But I think the words she had spoken were not as a friend, but out of a deeper emotion.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not something I can figure out by thinking about it.</div><div class="calibre5">What I should be thinking about now is the <i class="calibre6">"date"</i>, the normies event that I don't seem to have anything to do with.</div>
