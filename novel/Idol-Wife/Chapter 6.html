<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Online Game Nerd and Cool Idol</h3>

<div>"... It's almost time for the appointment." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>It was only a few minutes to 21.00.</div><div>I had already logged in and was staring at my computer screen.</div><div>What was shown on the screen was a young warrior-looking man fishing at the beach.</div><div>That's the character I'm controlling. The occupation is Warrior.</div><div>He is a nice guy who uses his sword and shield to fight in close quarters.</div><div>However, due to his unusually high mining skills, he has become a man who looks better with a pickaxe than a sword. <i><span style="color: #800180;">(<b>PTW/N</b>: Obviously)</span></i></div><div>And now he's fishing.</div><div>It was no longer a miner's day off.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Ah... I caught a fish. No, dÎ±mn, it&#8217;s a boot." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I Immediately discarded the boot from my inventory.</div><div>It was just worthless trash.</div><div>I regained my composure and started fishing again.</div><div>Probably I will be able to chat with Rin while fishing today.</div><div>Basically, I rarely play with Rin on weekdays.</div><div>Even if we did, it was limited to 20 to 30 minutes.</div><div><br /></div><div>Before, I just thought that she was busy with her real life.</div><div>But now, I could understand why I could only play with her on holidays.</div><div>I guess Mizuki-san was so busy with her idol activities so she didn't have much free time left on weekdays.</div><div><br /></div><div>"... It's more normal than I thought." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was expecting to be more nervous, but I was surprised at how relaxed I became.</div><div>When I thought about it, it was only natural.</div><div>I had just found out who Rin actually was.</div><div>But it was not that she became a different person.</div><div>After all, the environment of online game led me to normalcy.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Rin, I can't wait for you to get here." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I waited for a few minutes while fishing, and then.</div><div><i>[Rin-san has logged in]</i>, that notification is displayed in the chatbox at the bottom of the screen.</div><div>I decided to send her a quick chat.</div><div><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id. so, read only on my site, kay!)"~</i></div><div>[Thanks for your hard work~. I'm fishing right now.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Hee~, that's unusual! I can't believe Kazu is fishing!] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>O-oh, it's the usual Rin.</div><div>I was wondering <i>"which"</i> one she would come with, but I guess she came with Rin.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm going over there now~] (Rin)</div><div>[Okay.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I continued fishing on the beach.</div><div>Soon, Rin appeared riding on a horse.</div><div>After dismounting from the horse, Rin walked along the beach and came next to me.</div><div>She is an elf in a rather revealing outfit.</div><div><i>After all this time, I wonder if this is Mizuki-san's hobby......?</i></div><div>I guessed it somehow, but immediately continued the chat.</div><div><br /></div><div>[It's unusual for you to invite me on Monday.] (Kazu)</div><div>[You know, after what happened today, I just wanted to play with you, even if only for a little while.] (Rin)</div><div>[I see.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I Involuntarily loosened my cheeks.</div><div>I was genuinely happy.</div><div>Regardless of whether she was Mizuki-san or not.</div><div>Rin was holding a fishing rod, then threw the lure toward the sea.</div><div><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id. so, read only on my site, kay!)"~</i></div><div>The two of us began fishing side by side.</div><div>It had been a scene I had seen often over the past few years.</div><div>Even on the day when we confirmed each other's identities, nothing had changed on the screen.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I guess I can tell you this now. I was actually nervous the whole time I was at school~] (Rin)</div><div>[Nervous? Why?] (Kazu)</div><div>[Wasn't it natural for me to be nervous when I thought I was going to meet Kazu in person.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>[You didn't look like that at all. What I could see you were reading a book during this morning.]&nbsp; (Kazu)</div><div>[I just acted like I wasn't. I didn't even remember anything about the contents of the book.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>So that was what happened.</div><div>It seemed I wasn't the only one who was nervous.</div><div><br /></div><div>[So when my eyes met Kazuto-kun's, I didn't know what to do, so I waved my hand.] (Rin)</div><div>[Aah, so that was it.] (Kazu)</div><div>[I was so happy that you waved back. Was Kazuto-kun not nervous?] (Rin)</div><div><i style="color: white; text-align: center;">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata.my.id. so, read only on my site, kay!)"~</i></div><div>[I was really really nervous, you know. I was so nervous that I had to go to the lavatory in the morning.] (Kazu)</div><div>[That's too much. Kazuto-kun didn't seem to be nervous though.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>No, I was deadly nervous, you know.</div><div>If anything, I think I was more <i>"nervous"</i> more than anyone else on the planet at that moment.</div><div><br /></div><div>[At lunch break, when I tried to talk to Kazuto-kun, my voice trembled just a little...... I was so embarrassed and my face became hot, I thought fire would burst out of my face.] (Rin)</div><div>[Did you tremble? I think you were normal.] (Kazu)</div><div>[No. My voice was definitely trembling.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>Speaking of which......</div><div>At that time, Mizuki-san just said a few words and left the classroom immediately.</div><div><br /></div><div>She had always been looked so cool, so it was hard to understand her emotions, but when she told me what was on her mind, I found it very cute.</div><div><br /></div><div>We continued to talk about our day.</div><div>The conversation went on without a break, and the chat flowed smoothly.</div><div><br /></div><div>And when I realized,</div><div><br /></div><div>[Oh, it's so late already.......] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>An hour had passed in the blink of an eye.</div><div>It was now 22:12.</div><div>Up until now, Rin had always made sure to log out by 22:00.</div><div>She'd gone a little over.</div><div><br />
  
</div><div>[Are you going to get bed soon?] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I asked casually, and after a few seconds, a short reply came, <i>[Yes]</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>"...?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>An awkward silence followed.</div><div><i>Should I try to chat her more?</i></div><div>As I pondered for a while, I received a chat from Rin.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Do you have a headphone with microphone?] (Rin)</div><div>[I have, but why?] (Kazu)</div><div>[Why don't we do voice chat next time?] (Rin)</div><div>[Sure. Let's do that.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I see, she didn't have to hide her identity anymore, <i>so&nbsp;why don't we just chat with our voice?</i></div><div>I couldn't find any reason to refuse this proposal.</div><div><br /></div><div>[And also, are you free next Saturday night? I'm sure Nana and I can arrange it.] (Rin)</div><div>[I'm free. I'll make it free, no matter what.] (Kazu)</div><div>[That's a relief then. I won't be able to log in until Saturday, so you'll have to bear with it okay.] (Rin)</div><div>[That's too bad. If so I'll just play by myself.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Ahaha, Then...... Good night, Kazuto-kun. I'll see you at school tomorrow.] (Rin)</div><div>[Yeah, good night. See you tomorrow.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rin disappeared from the screen.</div><div><i>[Rin-san has logged out]</i> notification was displayed in the chat column.</div><div><br /></div><div>"... Shall I go to bed too?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>Normally, I would have stayed online until 23.00.&nbsp;</div><div>However, I was filled with a mysterious sense of fulfillment now.</div><div>I just wanted to lie down in bed while soaking in this pleasant lingering feeling.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Today was a great day, yes...." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>To put it more precisely, my daily life had changed since last night.</div><div>I wondered what would happen from now on.</div><div><br /></div><div>As I fell into bed, I thought about Mizuki-san until the moment I fell asleep.</div><div><br /></div>
