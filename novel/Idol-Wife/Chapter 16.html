<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Mizuki Kasumi</h3>

<div class="calibre5">"That's why, I'd like you guys to explain your relationship to me." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">We were taken into the living room and made to sit on chairs, where we were being questioned by "Mizuki Kasumi"-san, who was sitting across the table from us.</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san glares at us with her arms crossed, distorting her good-looking eyes into slight anger.</div><div class="calibre5">According to Rinka, Kasumi-san has a carefree personality and she seems to be a woman who doesn't care about the details.</div><div class="calibre5">But still, she gets angry if she is irritated, it's her nature to be reasonable.</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">My eyes are downcast, but I covertly raise my head to look at Kasumi-san</div><div class="calibre5">She is very beautiful.</div><div class="calibre5">Her hair, which stretches to below her shoulders, seems to have been carefully groomed, and it looks shiny and silky.</div><div class="calibre5">Naturally, her face was also in excellent shape.</div><div class="calibre5">The overall atmosphere of her is that of a big sister.</div><div class="calibre5">The three Mizuki sisters have wonderfully disparate personalities, really.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm? Is there something on my face?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"No, there's nothing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I was about to joke that she has beautiful eyes and nose on her face, but I decide to stop immediately.</div><div class="calibre5">I feel like I'm going to get punched if I make a little joke.</div><div class="calibre5">By the way, Nonoa-chan is sleeping in Rinka's room.</div><div class="calibre5">"So Rinka. Who is this guy?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ayanokouji Kazuto-kun. A boy in the same class as me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm. Are you guys dating?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka falls silent.</div><div class="calibre5">I'm expecting her will say something like, <i class="calibre6">"We're not just dating, we're a married couple."</i></div><div class="calibre5">Rinka looks down and doesn't try to make eye contact with her sister.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a rare sight.</div><div class="calibre5">"I can guess your relationship, but... Rinka, it's not a good idea to bring a man home, you know?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes, I know." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"What will you do if the public finds out? You'll get everyone in trouble." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka couldn't say a word as her right argument is piled on top of another right argument.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What a heavy atmosphere.</i></div><div class="calibre5">As I'm thinking that, Kasumi-san asks us something surprising in a whispered voice.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm going to ask you guys, have you had sexual intercourse yet?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">""Bufffffff!"" (Rinka, Kazuto) <span class="calibre8"><i class="calibre6">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> if you have a better onomatopoeia, please let me know, ehee~)</i></span></div>

<div class="calibre5">Rinka and I both simultaneously spurt out.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What the h*ll is this person asking us with a straight face?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"W-wait, Sister...!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Oh, not yet. So what about the kiss?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">""......"" (Rinka, Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"What, you haven't? So what kind of relationship do you guys have?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">We're just a couple in the game.</i></div><div class="calibre5">As I look at the surprised Kasumi-san, I mutter it in my mind.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ermm, so you guys are dating, right?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"We're more of a couple rather than dating." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......Huh?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Finally, Rinka says it.</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san makes her eyes round.</div><div class="calibre5">I feel like holding my head.</div><div class="calibre5">"We got to know each other through an internet game called <b class="calibre7">Black Plains</b>." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah~ right, Rinka had been into internet games since middle school." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's right. That's where Kazuto-kun and I got married." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmmm." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh, that's all?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"That is." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">Rinka nods nonchalantly to Kasumi-san, who asks with blinks.</div><div class="calibre5">I can understand what Kasumi-san thinks.</div><div class="calibre5">Perhaps she thought that Rinka and I were dating behind her back and that we were secretly having encounters.</div><div class="calibre5">But.</div><div class="calibre5">When she opened the lid, it turned out that we were just friends on an online game.</div><div class="calibre5">It's no wonder that Kasumi-san was surprised.</div><div class="calibre5">"So, about it. Are you guys dating in real life too?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"We're married in the game, so of course, we're a married couple even in real life, right?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't know what this little sister of mine is talking about." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">......I think this might have been the first time I've ever heard such a common reaction.</div><div class="calibre5">It is the normal reaction that should be.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sister wouldn't understand. How much the world of online games can transcend the real world in terms of heart-to-heart interaction." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"......... Ayanokouji-kun, right? What do you think about it?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">She changed the subject of the conversation to me.</div><div class="calibre5">It seems she decides that she can't have a proper conversation with Rinka.</div><div class="calibre5">"For me..... If I can get along with Rin――with Mizuki-san, then..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm. Well, my Rinka is so cute and an idol, yea." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's not what I meant. Even if Mizuki-san is plain or an ordinary person, I believe I still would have been here." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I don't want to be denied this one thing.</div><div class="calibre5">Although I have to admit that I question Rinka's over-the-top way of thinking, the years that Kazu and Rin have spent together are real.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not a bond that can be easily faded by real information.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kazuto-kun..." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">I can feel a feeling similar to respect from Rinka, who sits next to me.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Maybe I've said something pretty embarrassing?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm. Well, I don't know what kind of world the online game is...... but it seems pretty serious." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san nods as if she's convinced while folding her arms.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sister. If Kazuto-kun wasn't there, I wouldn't have been able to continue as an idol. So......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"So?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Can you please admit our relationship?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"...Your husband-wife relationship thing?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Hmm?</i></div><div class="calibre5">I don't even remember us officially dating yet, let alone being a couple......</div><div class="calibre5">No, but I have a feeling that this straightforward-looking big sister will say, <i class="calibre6">"Don't say stupid things!"</i> and reject――</div><div class="calibre5">"It can't be helped then. Let's admit it with my authority as a sister!" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Eh, you do admit it?</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What happened to your intimidation earlier?</i></div><div class="calibre5">"Sister...... Thank you." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, rather than giving Rinka to a flἰrtatious man, it's better to give her to that humble handsome guy over there." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"H-handsome guy, I'm not such a......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">I quickly deny it.</div><div class="calibre5">Seeing me like that, Kasumi-san smirks.</div><div class="calibre5">"Man maaan, You're being humble. You do indeed not look like the type of person who would attract a lot of attention, but I've seen that you're a modestly popular guy. You seem to have a personality that can clearly express your own opinions." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"That's...... No, I don't mind about me. But, it's bad for a popular idol like Rinka to be dating a guy, isn't it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"It is. But, you know, every idols have gone out with men in secret. In the worst cases, they have physical relations with multiple men, including their managers." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">What a dream-destroying story...</div><div class="calibre5">I'm stunned, but I say back.</div><div class="calibre5">"You were also negative about it at first, weren't you, Kasumi-san? I think you have said, <i class="calibre6">'What would you do if you get everyone in trouble?'</i> or something like that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, that was just acting" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"A-acting?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, you know, I was longing for that kind of thing. <i class="calibre6">When the daughter brought her marriage partner home, the father felt like to flip over the table in anger, right?</i> Aah~ I've always wanted to do something like that." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san laughs happily.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">What a woman she is!</i></div><div class="calibre5">"It's usually impossible for Rinka, who has a hard time making friends even of the same sex, to bring a man home. So, this is the first as well as the last chance I have." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"...If the public finds out about her relationship with me, I don't think she'll be able to continue being an idol." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">"Isn't it okay? She has worked hard enough. Now she has to find her own happiness as a girl." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">It's an appropriate way to say it, yet it's also thoughtful of Rinka's happiness.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm glad my sister said that, but I don't want to cause any trouble for everyone in <b class="calibre7">Star☆Mines</b>. So, can you please keep it secret." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course. They're good girls, too. Even though they're popular, they're not getting carried away." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">It seems that Kasumi-san has met the members of <b class="calibre7">Star☆Mines</b>.</div><div class="calibre5">There's nothing strange about that.</div><div class="calibre5">"I think we're done here. So, Ayanokouji Kazuto-kun." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yes?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre5">Kasumi-san with a meaningful smile stares at us.</div><div class="calibre5">"Next is――――let's say <i class="calibre6">hello</i> to our mother." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">......Seriously.</i></div><div class="calibre5">It's no longer possible to say that Rinka and I are not officially dating.</div><div class="calibre5">I feel that the obstacles in my way are removed at a rapid pace. <i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre8">(<b class="calibre7">PTW/N:</b> originally, "I feel that 'the outer moat is being filled' in at a rapid pace"; 外堀を埋める (the outer moat is filled) is an idiom that has the meaning "to remove obstacles in the way of one's objective".)</span></i></div>
