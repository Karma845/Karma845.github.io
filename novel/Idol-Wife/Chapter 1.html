<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; I am, Mizuki Rinka</h3>

<div>"I knew it, after all Mizuki-san was beautiful and cute." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>As I relaxed on my bed in my room, I was watching the music video of "<span style="color: #800180;"><b>Star&#9734;Mines</b></span>" on my phone.</div><div>There are five members of Star&#9734;Mines. All of them were high school girls.</div><div>They were wearing cute dresses and dancing cheerfully.</div><div>They are a rather popular idol group in the world.</div><div><br /></div><div>However, I'm only paying attention to Mizuki Rinka.</div><div>Rather than being a fan of Star&#9734;Mines, I was a fan of Mizuki Rinka.</div><div>The reason I became a fan of her was that we were in the same class.</div><div>Her outstanding appearance and cool demeanor caught my attention.</div><div>Looking back, I think this was the first time I clearly felt the existence of Idol.</div><div>I was not interested in idols before I met Mizuki-san.......</div><div><br /></div><div>But in the classroom, Mizuki-san stood out with a slightly cold attitude.</div><div>She always had a crisp expression and a serious attitude, which made some of the classmates distance themselves from her.</div><div>Still, she is a beautiful idol and is terrifyingly popular among boys.</div><div>But instead of talking to a particular boy, she had only the bare minimum of conversation with her classmates.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Perhaps she hates men?</i> Such a rumor was flowing.</div><div>Well, thinking normally, I guess she was just trying to avoid any scandal (?).</div><div>If the public knew that she was getting along with a certain guy, her fans would probably leave her at once.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, when you asked if she was on good terms with the girls, that seemed not the case.</div><div><br /></div><div>In fact, Mizuki-san was rather isolated in the classroom.</div><div><br /></div><div>Even so, she seemed to get along well with certain girls, and I would occasionally see her talking with girls from her idol group.</div><div><br /></div><div>One of the reasons why Mizuki-san tends to be isolated is probably because her air is different from that of ordinary people.</div><div>The aura she wore was clearly different from us ordinary people.</div><div><br /></div><div>Even I, who is called a man who can't read the atmosphere by others, can only watch Mizuki-san's back from the corner of the classroom.</div><div>Just talking to her makes me nervous.</div><div>It's hard to talk to her because of the tense atmosphere she exudes.</div><div><br /></div><div>"But I want to at least greet her. And then hear her reply 'good morning' in her beautiful voice.......!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>People said that Mizuki-san is the best singer in the group.</div><div>And I strongly agree with that.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Gather your courage, and try to greet her tomorrow morning...!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't have romantic feelings for her, but I want to be able to greet her as a classmate at least.</div><div>It had already been a few weeks since I had this with.</div><div>I'm too much of a slacker.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>*Ping*.</i></div><div>A notification sounded from my phone.</div><div>It was from a voice chat application for a game.</div><div>The name of the message sender is "<b><span style="color: #800180;">Rin</span></b>".</div><div><br /></div><div>[I've logged in ya know~] (Rin)</div><div>"Ah, already the time, huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>The time now is 21:07.</div><div>The meeting time is 21:00, so I'm already late.</div><div>I was so engrossed in Mizuki-san that I forgot the time I was supposed to meet my friend.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm sorry. I'll be in soon.]</div><div><br /></div><div>I replied, then booted up my computer.</div><div>I started an MMO called "<b><span style="color: #800180;">Black Plains</span></b>", which boasts an overwhelming degree of freedom.</div><div><br /></div><div>This open-world game with realistic graphics is a great web game that allows you to enjoy all kinds of role-playing, from battles to daily life.</div><div><br /></div><div>One of its features is you can play it from smartphone.</div><div><br /></div><div>By the way, my player name is "<b><span style="color: #800180;">Kazu</span></b>".</div><div>The origin of it is my real name.</div><div>My real name is Ayanokouji Kazuto.</div><div>In other words, I just took the first two letters of my name.</div><div><br /></div><div>As soon as I logged in, I received a chat from Rin.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I've been waiting for you~. It's been a long time, yes~] (Rin)</div><div>[It's been a long time? Haven't we met just last Sunday?] (Kazu)</div><div>[Then it's been a week! I've been looking forward to playing games with you all week, Kazu!] (Rin)</div><div>[Hey hey] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>She's as excited as ever, The tension is high.</div><div>This player, "Rin", is a friend of mine from a web game that I've been friends with since we were in the second grade of middle school.</div><div>I'm in my second grade of high school now, so...... we've been friends for four years now.</div><div>I guess you could call us best friends on the Internet.</div><div>Well, maybe more than best friends, since we're married, albeit in-game.</div><div>At least Rin treats me casually and without hesitation.</div><div><br /></div><div>[What are we doing today? By the way, I think I want to go fishing~] (Rin)</div><div>[I want to go to the mine to collect ore and improve my mining skills.] (Kazu)</div><div>[What are we doing today? By the way, I think I want to go fishing~] (Rin)</div><div>[Are you a bot!? My demand didn't even convey!] (Kazu)</div><div>[Let's go fishing.] (Rin)</div><div>[It's already a compulsion, huh.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>If that's the case, don't ask me "What are we doing today?"...</i></div><div>I'm not going to send it, though.</div><div>It's just a way to say hello to each other.</div><div>Rin also understands that.</div><div>We don't know anything about each other's real-life situations, but we've built up a certain amount of trust.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I wonder what the real Rin is like." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>In the past, I had casually asked her about her real life.</div><div>But she said she didn't want to talk about real life, so I didn't pursue the subject any further.</div><div><br /></div><div>She told me that she didn't want to talk about real-life because it would ruin the purity the relationship of us.</div><div><br /></div><div>I understand what she means.</div><div>I know it's extreme, but if Rin actually was a yakuza, I'll uninstall Black Plains, destroy my computer, and thoroughly distance myself.</div><div><br /></div><div>Well, anything is fine.</div><div>It doesn't matter to me who Rin is (as long as she's not a yakuza).</div><div><br /></div><div>It's fun to play games together.</div><div>That fact is the most important thing ...</div><div><br /></div><div>I enjoy playing games with her.</div><div>That fact is the most important thing......</div><div><br /></div><div>[Hey, Kazu. Let's go out to sea on my boat.] (Rin)</div><div>[I don't want to, because it'll sink.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Why do you say that? It's absolutely gonna be okay!] (Rin)</div><div>[That's the third time I've heard that line. And I always have to help you gather materials to repair the boat.] (Kazu)</div><div>[It's going to be okay this time! I've been looking up how to operate a boat better on video site.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rin, whose avatar dressed as a cute elf on the screen, showed guts pose with her fist clasped.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm counting on you, okay? It's really hard to repair a boat you know.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Leave it to me! I feel like I can do anything right now!] (Rin)</div><div><br />

</div><div>And so, with such mysterious confidence, I followed Rin out to sea in a boat that was maybe a little bigger than a small boat.</div><div>If we got too far from land, we'll be attacked by pirate ships, so we had to be careful.</div><div>We stopped the boat and began fishing.</div><div>I enjoyed casually chatting with this friend of mine while waiting for any fish to bite.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Hey Kazu. I still haven't heard your apology for being late.] (Rin)</div><div>[I'm sorry.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Why were you late?] (Rin)</div><div>[I was watching an idol music video.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Hee. So Kazu was interested in idols.] (Rin)</div><div>[Well, sort of.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I replied, and then a few seconds of silence followed.</div><div>I was in a daze, looking at the fishing line hanging from the boat into the sea.</div><div>Rin didn't seem to be catching any fish either.</div><div><br /></div><div>[What is the name of the idol?] (Rin)</div><div>[I thought we weren't allowed to talk about real life?] (Kazu)</div><div>[This time is different. So tell me.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>Don't bite into it.</div><div>You're not a fish, you're Rin, aren't you.</div><div><br /></div><div>[It's a group called Star&#9734;Mines. Do you know them?] (Kazu)</div><div>[Yea.] (Rin)</div><div>[I'm a fan of Mizuki Rinka, so I watch them a lot.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Is that so.] (Rin)</div><div>[Yeah. I'm, actually in the same class as Mizuki-san you know. How's it, Isn't it amazing?] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I was a little proud of myself.</div><div>Then she stopped replying.</div><div><br /></div><div>One minute, two minutes, three minutes...... of silence followed.</div><div>This silence is the bad kind of silence.</div><div>And even though Rin's fishing rod was shaking, indicating that the fish was biting, Rin didn't seem to be catching anything.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Is she AFK?&#12288;</i></div><div><i>What, at this timing?&#12288;</i></div><div><i>It's too abrupt.</i></div><div><br /></div><div><i>Did I say something wrong?</i></div><div>Maybe I shouldn't have boasted that I was in the same class as Mizuki-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm sorry, Rin. I was in a good mood and said unnecessary things. I'm sorry if I offended you.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I apologized for now.</div><div>I sweated my hands a little and moistened the mouse while waiting for a response.</div><div><br /></div><div>The chat finally came back just as the fish escaped from Rin's fishing rod.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm, Mizuki Rinka.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>.........</div><div>.........Hmm?</div><div><br /></div><div>[Haha. What are you saying out of the blue? I can clearly tell that it&#8217;s a lie.] (Kazu)</div><div>[Second year, third class. The homeroom teacher is Sato-sensei. The seat I'm sitting in is the second row from the window, the very front seat.] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>What flowed into the text window was information about Mizuki Rinka.</div><div><br /></div><div>......Th, that's a joke, isn't that.</div><div>Those completely hitting right.</div><div><br /></div><div>No, but it's not necessarily Mizuki-san herself.</div><div>It could be one of her classmates.</div><div><br /></div><div>[Who is Kazu?] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What should I do? Is it okay to tell her?</i></div><div>But I don't think "Rin" would lie to me.</div><div>If that's the case, then Rin is Mizuki-san......</div><div><br /></div><div>[Can't you believe me?] (Rin)</div><div><br /></div><div>When I was asked that, I felt a little guilty and my chest hurt.</div><div>I couldn't help but type in the chat.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm the guy who sits at the back seat of the near window row.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>I answer a little blur.</div><div>Immediately, there was a reply came in.</div><div><br />

</div><div>[Ayanokouji Kazuto-kun, right?] (Rin)</div><div>[.....It's a bingo.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, whether she's Mizuki-san or not, This made it more likely that Rin was a classmate of mine.</div><div><br /></div><div>[I'm sorry. It's already time to log out.] (Rin)</div><div>[Okay.] (Kazu)</div><div><br /></div><div>Rin disappears from the boat.</div><div><i>Was she disappointed to find out that it was me by any chance?</i></div><div>If so, I'm very very shocked here.</div><div>I shouldn't have talked about real-life if this was going to happen.</div><div>Oh no, although Rin had told me once.</div><div>That bringing real-life situations would distort the online relationship between us.</div><div>I should have thought more deeply about what that meant.</div><div><br /></div><div>"I've done it....." (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What would I do if I couldn't play with Rin anymore?</i></div><div>When I was holding my head and regretting my shallowness, I heard a notification from my smartphone.</div><div>It was from Rin.</div><div>The content is, <i>"Would you like to go to the cafeteria with me tomorrow during lunch break?"</i>.</div><div>Then I replied with, <i>"Yes"</i>, even though I was shaking with nervousness.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>What if it's really Mizuki-san?</i></div><div>It's not half bad, though.</div><div>......No, think about it calmly.</div><div>There's still a possibility that Rin is not Mizuki-san.</div><div><br /></div><div>Because, "The bright and innocent Rin" and "The cool character Mizuki Rinka" have completely different personalities.</div><div>Yes, it's a fake. It must be a fake.</div><div>I'm sure one of my classmates is playing a joke on me.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>*Ping*</i></div><div>I received another message from Rin.</div><div><br /></div><div>The title is "I'll prove I'm real".</div><div>When I tapped to open the message, I found a selfie of Mizuki-san with a computer screen in the background.</div><div><br /></div><div>I tried an image search on the Internet, but got no hits.</div><div>In other words, it wasn't a picture that she had picked up from the internet.</div><div><br /></div><div>"Se-seriously? She is the real one...!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div><div>My hand holding the smartphone shook unusually.</div><div>I felt a small panic in my head.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"M-my wife in the web game is... a popular idol ...!" (Kazuto)</div><div><br /></div>
