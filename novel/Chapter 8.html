<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Dungeon Battle</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gold,
Nemumu, it's a wolf hunt."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Roger,
Dark-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You,
are you guys going to fight?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">You're
against the Great Bush Wolf, the boss of the first level!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hahaha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">In
our eyes, a monster like this is nothing. This is a great opportunity to teach
the youngsters how to fight with sword and shield!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others looked surprised at our choice to fight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
ignored their reactions, and with great enthusiasm, golden shield and his sword
he stepped to the front line.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Grrrrrr......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
great Bush Wolf's and ten Bush Wolves are growling at Gold in front of them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
kept his relaxed attitude and called out to Erio and the others behind him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
seen your fight with the goblins, but...."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Grrrrgaaaaah!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Three
Bush Wolves run through the grass and attack Gold.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
fur is a grassy green, making it difficult to see them as they run, but Gold
blocks their attack calmly.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
guys used shield to defend and sword to attack. Just like this!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He uses
his shield to block one of the Bush Wolves from jumping on him, and swing his
sword to suppress the other two. Because of that, the other two wolves are
forced to hold back.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Protect
with shield, attack with sword. It's not wrong, but it's not right either. Do
you understand? There's no rule that says you must use your shield for defense
and your sword for attack. For example..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Cyan!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
swings his shield at one of the Bush Wolf as it jumps at him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
shield hits the Bush Wolf in the nose, causing him to scream, then Gold crush his
skull to death.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
can strike like this. The shield's role is not only to protect. You can't just
swing your sword, you have to read your opponent's movements and hit them. You
have to use your head and think about what your enemy scared of and what you
can do to catch them off guard. Just swinging a sword and hiding behind a
shield will not make you stronger."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
lecturing, Gold slaughtered the Bush Wolves one by one without losing a breath.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
can't lose too!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Fire
Arrow!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Can!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
released the attack magic "R, Fire Arrow" and killed one of the Bush
Wolves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Then,
I killed two or three more with the same attack magic.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(During
the Race Union time, I always admired people who could use magic, and its fun
to be able to imitate a magician, even if I only pretending to be one using the
Infinity Gacha card."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are humans who can use magic, but the number is small.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
it's actually quite a rare case for a beginner party like them to have a magician
member. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya,
the younger sister, was stunned and mumblings in surprise.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ah,
amazing...... You, you're about my age but you able to use magic without
chanting......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Normally,
when using magic, one had to concentrate and chant a spell to activate the magic,
just like Miya did.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
you are a skilled magician, you can use magic without casting spells.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though I'm the same age as her, she can't use battle class magic without
chanting. As a magician she is amazed by my abilities.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Waoooooooooo!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Howling?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Is
he calling more of his friends......? No, that's a signal to escape?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">One
of the annoying things about the Great Bush Wolf is their habit of howling to
gather his fellow Bush Wolves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I fought a pack of Great Bush Wolves during the Races Union time, even if they
were defeated their friends kept coming to attack.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
this time after howling, the Great Bush Wolf rushing off into the woods.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Seems
that he realized that he couldn't win and gave the signal to run away.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
not gonna let my prey get away!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Firewall!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Whoa!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
quickly use a 'SR, Firewall' and create wall of flames to block their escape
route.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No
way! He's using a tactical class magic!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Mi,
Miya?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
shouted so loudly with a shocked expression that her eyes wide open.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
first time in her life that the quiet girl had raised her voice so loud.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
brother, who was standing beside her, seemed to find Miya's shouting unusual
and turned his attention to his sister, even though he was watching Gold's
battle.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Without
paying attention to them we continue the battle.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Leave
it to me, Dark-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
holding a knife in each hand, quickly chopped off the head of the stunned Great
Bush Wolf.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
this, the Great Bush Wolf and all the Bush Wolves has been slaughtered.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
the battle was over, the little sister Miya, who had been the quiet until now,
excitedly grabbed her shoulder and shook her brother back and forth.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
Onii-chan, did you see that? A human boy, no older than me, not only he battle
magic, but he also used tactical class magic, the Firewall spell!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Calm,
calm down, Miya. Is that a great thing?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course that's a great thing! I'm sure there are old elves, demons, and dragons that
can use it, but I've never heard of any human that can use a tactical class
magic! We're now witnessing a new history in magic."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Mi,
Miya-chan, a new history, are you serious......?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
serious!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">It's amazing; you're like a hero or a
brave man!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya,
who has a quiet personality, stares at me with her sparkling eyes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
response to her reaction.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Fufufu,
to be able to understand how wonderful and great Dark-sama is. You have good
eyes"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ahahahaha......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Somehow,
Nemumu was bragging about it as if it was her own greatness.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu's
reaction was cute and flattering, but also embarrassing, and I can't help but let
out a slight chuckle.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know you're happy to hear someone praise our Lord, but it won't be funny if the
enemy notice the commotion and calls for reinforcements. Stop puffing out your
flat chest. Let's just collect the magic stone and get out of here."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know, I know. And who's the flat chest?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
of course it's you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
a bright red face, Nemumu slapped the back of Gold's head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
ignored it and started to take out the magic stone from the Bush Wolf he had
defeated.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold's
opinion is correct. I smiled and quickly moved my hands to work too.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
we'll help you too as a gratitude for your help."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you, then we'll count on you."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thanks
to Erio and the others help, we finished the work in less than ten minutes, and
we were able to leave before enemy reinforcements arrived.</span></p></div>
