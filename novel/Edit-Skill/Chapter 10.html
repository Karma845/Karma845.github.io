<h3>Chapter 10: Beyond the Night</h3>

<p>“”Delicious!!””</p>



<p>My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed Yorka’s homemade hamburgers.</p>



<p>There was even a sunny-side-up on top. From rice and miso soup to well-thought-out vegetable sides like glazed carrots and potato salad, the nutritional balance was spot on. Given the available ingredients, Yorka’s cooking skills were impressively splendid.</p>



<p>“I’m glad,” Yorka smiled contentedly, looking at the empty plates.</p>



<p>“I’ll take care of the cleanup. Yorka, you can relax.” I carried the dishes to the sink.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. I don’t mind washing dishes either.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t help at all with cooking. Let me at least do this.”</p>



<p>“In that case, let’s do it together,” Yorka said as she joined me in the kitchen.</p>



<p>Yorka, with her apron on and hair tied back in a ponytail, stood next to me.</p>



<p>“I’ll wash, and Kisumi, you can dry.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Somewhat it feels like the roles are reversed today.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“I’m giving an order to the class rep.”</p>



<p>“I never knew you were so domestic.”</p>



<p>“I enjoy housework. It feels good when everything is neat and tidy.”</p>



<p>“You’re quite skilled to whip up something without even looking at the recipe.”</p>



<p>“Well, you get used to it. After making home-cooked meals a few times, you pick it up.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, is there no weakness in Arisaka Yorka?”</p>



<p>Although I was aware, my girlfriend could pretty much do anything.</p>



<p>“…Says the guy who always targets people’s weaknesses.”</p>



<p>“Me? Where?”</p>



<p>I maintained a distance close enough for my breath to reach her ears.</p>



<p>“Love.”</p>



<p>Yorka slightly averted her face. The tail of her ponytail bouncing, and her graceful white neck caught my eye.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, Kisumi-kun, are you and Yorka-chan going to get married?”</p>



<p>Out of the blue, my sister threw a question like a fastball.</p>



<p>“Ehh──!?”</p>



<p>Taken aback, Yorka’s hands trembled and the plate slipped from her grasp. I reacted in a split second and grabbed the plate before it hit the floor.</p>



<p>“Nice catch! As expected of you, Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Ei, don’t say weird things. We’re still in high school!”</p>



<p>“Wife… I become Kisumi’s wife… Kyaa!” Yorka indulged in wild fantasies about our future while blushing.</p>



<p>“But if Yorka-chan becomes my big sister, I’ll be so happy! We can have delicious meals every day!”</p>



<p>“Wait, am I going to be Ei-chan’s sister-in-law!? I’ll have a little sister!?”</p>



<p>Next to us, someone was excited like they’d made the discovery of the century.</p>



<p>“Even if we get married, we won’t be living with you.”</p>



<p>My sister was already planning to naturally parasitize the newlywed couple’s home. It would be hard to be lovey-dovey with her around!</p>



<p>“Aww, no fair! I want to live with Yorka-chan too!”</p>



<p>“Don’t be selfish.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, do you want to monopolize Yorka-chan that much?” My sister asked innocently.</p>



<p>The answer was, of course, already a given.</p>



<p>“That’s right. Yorka is my girlfriend, and I have no intention of sharing her to anyone else.”</p>



<p>“K-K-Kisumi! Th-that’s a pro, pro, proposal…!” Yorka seemed to be spasming, unable to articulate the words properly.</p>



<p>“Oh, right! Yorka-chan, stay over tonight! Let’s all sleep together!”</p>



<p>“”Huh?!””</p>



<p>“Sounds good! Yay!”</p>



<p>“Don’t decide on your own!” I hurriedly intervened to stop my sister from running wild.</p>



<p>“The rain is still pretty heavy, and it’ll be tough for Yorka-chan to go home. Besides, Mom and Dad aren’t here today.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Idiot.”</p>



<p>My sister, who agreed to keep our parents’ absence a secret, casually spilled the beans. Is this what kids in compulsory education are like?</p>



<p>Yorka, who was lively just a moment ago, suddenly became awkward.</p>



<p>“Sorry. I forgot too until Ei reminded me. I didn’t mean to hide it or anything.”</p>



<p>“Oh, right… yeah, I get it.”</p>



<p>“I know it’s impossible for you to stay overnight. Your family would worry.”</p>



<p>I attempted to dismiss my sister’s whim with a very practical reason. After all, how could one possibly sleep under the same roof as the person you liked!?</p>



<p>“Um, well, my parents are both on a long business trip in the States, so don’t worry. My older sister is staying overnight at the university lab as usual, so it’s okay.”</p>



<p>Honest! My girlfriend was surprisingly so honest. She’s not going to refuse? Um, aren’t you supposed to avoid that part?</p>



<p>“Yay, it’s decided! I’m looking forward to it!”</p>



<p>While my sister rejoiced, I tried to gauge Yorka’s true feelings.</p>



<p>“Is it really okay?”</p>



<p>“I already took a bath, and I don’t want to get wet going home again. So… yeah, that’s why.”</p>



<p>The word ‘no’ didn’t escape Yorka’s lips.</p>



<p>Someone, please give me a spare heart. I might explode soon.</p>


<p>Because my sister adamantly insisted on the three of us sleeping together, I laid out three futons in the Japanese-style guest room. I left Yorka, who offered to help, in charge of keeping my sister company.</p>



<p>Later, I finally cooled my head while taking a bath.</p>



<p>Three people would be sleeping together, we weren’t necessarily alone with each other. Just lying side by side, chatting a bit and deepening our friendship. Nothing more, nothing less. Once we fell asleep, morning would come.</p>



<p>“Just that, isn’t it? Haha!”</p>



<p>I spoke these positive and peaceful words out loud while continuing to shower with cold water.</p>



<p>Farewell, troublesome desires!</p>



<p>I returned to the living room with a body chilled to the core to find Yorka and Ei engrossed in a variety show on TV.</p>



<p>“You two seem to be getting along well.”</p>



<p>“Yorka-chan is so nice.”</p>



<p>My sister clung to Yorka shamelessly. Damn, elementary kids these days had no sense of restraint.</p>



<p>“Are you jealous of Ei-chan?” My girlfriend teased me as if she saw right through me.</p>



<p>“She’s got this clinging habit. She won’t let go like a grumpy old man. Be prepared.”</p>



<p>“It’s normal for girls. I even hug stuffed animals sometimes.”</p>



<p>“Just stuffed animals?”</p>



<p>“Uh… That time was a reward! It was special!” Yorka, recalling the hug in the infirmary, retorted.</p>



<p>“When’s the next one, I wonder ~”</p>



<p>I put up a brave front, trying not to reveal my inner turmoil and settled on the edge of the couch.</p>



<p>Yorka, who wasn’t used to watching TV regularly, was receiving explanations from Ei. Listening to their lively conversation, I realized this was the first time I’d seen Yorka talked so much.</p>



<p>Her usual distant and cold demeanor in class was absent, and she treated my sister as a kind older sister. There was no sign of her forcing herself. It seemed entirely genuine, lacking any forced facade.</p>



<p>“Yorka, feel free to ignore Ei’s chatter if it gets tiring.”</p>



<p>“Ei-chan is good at talking, so it’s fun!”</p>



<p>“Hehe. I’m flattered,” the fourth-grader proudly responded.</p>



<p>“Only taking compliments at face value, huh?”<br />I muttered quietly.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, do you sometimes act cold towards Ei-chan?”</p>



<p>“Siblings are like that. Even you don’t get along with your sister all the time, right?”</p>



<p>“My sister is moody. She only pays attention when she feels like it. So, I might envy Ei-chan a bit.”</p>



<p>“Envy?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Despite everything, Kisumi, you’re always there for Ei-chan. Even when you’re being mean, you never ignore her. After coming over to play today, I realize that you’re good at taking care of others.”</p>



<p>“We’re seven years apart. If I took my eyes off her, who knows what she’d do. Our parents weren’t around all the time, so naturally, I had to take care of her. It’s become a habit, I guess.”</p>



<p>“Anyway, Kisumi, you’re a good big brother,” Yorka complimented me sincerely.</p>



<p>“Thanks. You’ve been calling me Kisumi a lot today.”</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, I have.”</p>



<p>Unconsciously, huh?</p>



<p>“Maybe I relax more here. Thanks to Ei-chan.”</p>



<p>My sister, absorbed in the TV, seemed oblivious to Yorka’s words.</p>



<p>“I spend many nights alone, that’s why having this lively atmosphere is refreshing.”</p>



<p>“Don’t you dislike lively things?”</p>



<p>“I like this.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Yorka, feel free to drop by whenever you’re free.”</p>



<p>“…Really?”</p>



<p>“I might not be able to entertain much, but Ei likes you, and being with you is fun for me too—”</p>



<p>Before finishing my sentence, Yorka grabbed my hand.</p>



<p>I reciprocated the gesture in silence.</p>



<p>Outside the window, the rain continued to fall.</p>

<p>Outside the window, the rain continued to fall.</p>



<p><strong>***</strong></p>



<p>Bedtime came early for elementary schoolers. Even as a fourth-grader, my healthy sister who had never had a problem with sleeping at night succumbed to drowsiness around nine o’clock.</p>



<p>“Ei, brush your teeth before bed. Make sure to brush them thoroughly.”</p>



<p>“Yesss.”</p>



<p>My sister replied in a sleepy voice as we made our way to the bathroom.</p>



<p>“Here, Yorka, use this,” I handed Yorka an extra toothbrush.</p>



<p>“Thanks.”</p>



<p>For some reason, the three of us ended up brushing our teeth side by side.</p>



<p>We then moved to the guest room where three neatly arranged futons await, resembling a peaceful expanse of white ocean waves.</p>



<p>“Ei’s taking the middle!”</p>



<p>“Calm down. You’ll kick up dust.”</p>



<p>“Booo. How about throwing pillows?” Ei protested discontentedly.</p>



<p>“Save that for school trips or sleepovers with your friends. High schoolers don’t engage in that sort of thing.”</p>



<p>I covered her with her futons, settling her down.</p>



<p>“Yorka, take the inner side. I’ll be by the entrance. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to wake me up.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Alright, I’ll turn off the lights.”</p>



<p>The room plunged into darkness. I crawled into my futon, finally letting go of the tension that had gripped my entire body.</p>



<p>Ei and Yorka started to engage in hushed whispers. I wasn’t so uncouth as to interrupt their girls’ talk.</p>



<p>The moment I laid down on the soft futon, the tension in my body released, and drowsiness swept over me like a gentle tide. Perhaps I had been mentally drained as well.</p>



<p>This was a relief.</p>



<p>With my sister acting as a buffer, I could rest without dwelling on inappropriate thoughts. I surrendered to this calm feeling and swiftly drifted into sleep.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>Me and Ei-chan chatted until the latter drifted off to sleep. It seemed Kisumi had done the same in the back. I was the only one still awake.</p>



<p>“Somehow, it turned out to be quite a memorable day.”</p>



<p>If I wanted, I could have headed home. But I chose to stay the night—a bold decision even by my standards.</p>



<p>Skipping several steps quite evidently, here I was, staying overnight at my boyfriend’s place.</p>



<p>Ever since I started dating Kisumi, I found myself doing things I’d never dream of doing alone. It’s scary, yet having Kisumi by my side gave me courage.</p>



<p>“I’m glad you enjoyed the dinner.”</p>



<p>This was the first time I’d served homemade food to anyone other than my family, and I was secretly quite nervous. So seeing both Kisumi and Ei-chan enjoying the food made me incredibly happy.</p>



<p>A brother and sister bound not only by familial ties but by unrestrained love for each other. Ei-chan, who had such a reliable older brother, was indeed fortunate.</p>



<p>“Maybe I was the one feeling jealous.”</p>



<p>The little sister, who was sleeping with a cute expression, could indulge in Sena Kisumi’s comfort every day.</p>



<p>“It must be nice.”</p>



<p>For wishing to be your boyfriend’s sister—I realized I was afflicted with quite a serious condition. I know I like Kisumi, but it seemed my feelings for him ran deeper than I was aware of.</p>



<p>Feeling such strong affection for someone else was new, I struggled with how to handle these emotions. The mix of desire, embarrassment, reassurance, and jealousy created a constant state of instability within me.</p>



<p>──If Kisumi were to disappear from my life, what would become of me?</p>



<p>“I’m such a needy woman.”</p>



<p>I tried to apply the brakes to my feelings self-deprecatingly. Yet, today’s events lingered in my heart, accelerating my feelings even more.</p>



<p>I’ve avoided connections with others for so long. Every presence felt like an enemy—foreign objects causing stress and a bothersome entity.</p>



<p>Yet, when Sena Kisumi confessed to me, I found myself unable to refuse.</p>



<p>As the time spent with Kisumi as his girlfriend increased, the more I started contemplating what would happen if I were to lose him.</p>



<p>I feared vulnerability.</p>



<p>High school romances didn’t last forever; the fear of getting hurt further prevented me from diving deeper.</p>



<p>What would happen if his love for me faded away?</p>



<p>“I can’t sleep, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>The joy of being at my boyfriend’s house and the anxiety about the future kept me awake indefinitely. On the other side of Ei-chan, my beloved was already asleep.</p>



<p><em>This is unfair. He doesn’t know about my dilemma.</em></p>



<p>So, this was just a spontaneous act on this sleepless night.</p>



<p>Silently, I slipped out of my own futon. Muffling my footsteps, I moved gently toward where Kisumi slept.</p>



<p>I squatted down and gazed at his sleeping face. He’s sound asleep.</p>



<p>I quietly slipped into his futon, cautiously touching his arm and surrendering myself.</p>



<p>The warmth and scent of his body made me feel incredibly secure and happy. I closed my eyes, melting into the blissful comfort while wishing this moment could last forever.</p>


<p>If you went to bed early, you tended to wake up early.</p>



<p>An oddly soft and warm sensation lingered beside me. When I tried to move my right arm, I was met with a pleasantly bouncy force.</p>



<p>“What the…?”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/147084.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>In a daze, I turned to my right.</p>



<p>Yorka’s sleeping face was right there.</p>



<p>“────Aa!!”</p>



<p>I suppressed my voice, feeling astonished.</p>



<p>Yorka should have been sleeping on the other side of Ei. Why is she right next to me? Is this a dream? Even while entertaining these doubts, I could unmistakably hear her calm breathing near my ear.</p>



<p>Snuggled up perfectly beside me, Yorka slept soundly and looked comfortable.</p>



<p>Moving would be risky; I mustn’t wake her. I cautiously moved only my head to look at my sister. Because of her atrocious sleeping habits, Ei had somehow taken over Yorka’s futon.</p>



<p>Did Yorka crawl into my futon half-asleep when she got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night? I couldn’t fathom Yorka coming into my futon on her own accord.</p>



<p>“You look so happy.”</p>



<p>I wanted to savor this perfect moment for as long as possible. Her skin, faintly touched mine, felt warm. Even though we used the same shampoo at my house, she inexplicably smelled good.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Yorka wrapped herself around me as if turning me into a body pillow. Her slender arms wrapped around my chest, and her soft legs snugly positioned around my lower half.</p>



<p>If I tried to break free now, she’d undoubtedly wake up. However, this situation was quite stimulating for a high school boy. If I lowered my gaze, her deep cleavage would clearly visible from the loose neckline.</p>



<p>Even though my freedom was restricted—could there be any other situation that made me feel so incredibly happy? Almost inadvertently, I felt a sense of enlightenment.</p>



<p>The rain had completely stopped overnight, and the light through the sliding doors indicated it was still early morning. My courage wasn’t thick enough to go back to sleep at this point.</p>



<p>It felt like a dream to be snuggled up with a beauty. The excitement and nervousness had long dispelled the drowsiness of waking up.</p>



<p>“Mm…”</p>



<p>With yet another toss and turn, my sister rolled over to the opposite side and ended up right next to me.</p>



<p>Hold on a sec! It was bad enough she crossed two futons with her awful sleeping habits, but now she was clinging to my arm like a koala!</p>



<p>I was utterly stuck. Sandwiched between my girlfriend and my sister, escape was utterly impossible.</p>



<p>After enduring this for about three hours, Yorka, in her sleepy haze, briefly opened her eyes. I had already resigned myself to my fate. Yorka, with her drowsy gaze, looked at my defeated face.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kisumi is here. Mmm ~”</p>



<p>Still in a dream-like state, she mumbled incoherently and embraced me even tighter. Well, wasn’t she quite the late riser!</p>



<p>In her drowsiness, Yolka managed to loop her arm around my neck and pressed her chest against me mercilessly. The sensation was too soft, directly rubbing against me.</p>



<p>Although she had a slender frame, why was she so incredibly soft?</p>



<p>Too close, way too close! Was she getting even closer!? Arisaka Yorka, you’re way too defenseless!</p>



<p>“I can’t take it anymore! It’s impossible!”</p>



<p>With guilt and excitement reaching their limits, I couldn’t help but jump out of the futon. I rolled out into the hallway from the guest room and dashed into the living room.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>Kisumi’s emergency escape finally woke me up. I was in a daze for a while. From Ei-chan’s position, I realized I was in a different spot than where I originally slept.</p>



<p>And then, in that moment of realization, I remembered my actions from the previous night.</p>



<p>“N-No way… AAAAHHHH──────────!?”</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by embarrassment, my face turned into a burning mess as I instinctively buried myself under the futon.</p>



<p>Yet, within that sanctuary, I felt his warmth and scent, plunging me into another indescribable sensation as I writhed in turmoil.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>“Good morning, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“Morning, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>We faced each other in the living room as if nothing happened and shared breakfast together. At the table, Ei was the only one talking enthusiastically, while Yorka and I simply nodded along.</p>



<p>Even on the way to the station, where I accompanied Yorka who now had changed into a dry uniform, there was hardly any conversation.</p>



<p>However, amid the refreshing morning air after the rain, walking together felt remarkably fulfilling.</p>



<p>I believe Yoruka felt the same way.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Interlude 3</strong></p>


<p>I visited his house for the first time, even meeting his little sister, Ei-chan</p>



<p>Despite being in the third grade, she surprised me with her height. However, her childlike innocence put me at ease. It was evident she’s adept at feigning selfishness to get her way with her big brother.</p>



<p>Their faces looked nothing alike. Ei-chan had a flashy appearance, and there’s no doubt she’d grow into a beauty. Taking care of such a cute sister daily, it was understandable that he wouldn’t be intimidated by girls in his class.</p>



<p>If you consider Ei-chan as the standard, his criteria for a beautiful girl must be exceptionally high. The girl he fell in love with must be quite beautiful, so he probably wouldn’t be able to confess.</p>



<p>I found solace in knowing I was the only one aware of Sena Kisumi’s charm. There couldn’t possibly be anyone else interested.</p>



<p>Or so I thought.</p>



<p>“Miyachi, there’s a girl I’ve liked for a long time. What should I do?”</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, his love story had already begun.</p>



<p>Around the time the cherry blossoms bloomed, he finally confessed.</p>



<p>With the selfish prayer in my heart,</p>



<p><em>──May his confession fail.</em></p>



<p>I secretly watched from above.</p>



<p>I saw the girl he confessed to ran away from the cherry blossom tree, leaving him standing there dumbfounded.</p>



<p>When he suddenly looked up at the school building, I instinctively hid beneath the window.</p>



<p>My heart raced. Not because he almost spotted me, but…<em>I still have a chance. </em>At least, that’s how it appeared to me.</p>
