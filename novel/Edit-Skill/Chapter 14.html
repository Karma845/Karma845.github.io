<h3>Afterwords</h3>



<p>Nice to meet you, or perhaps, it’s been a while. This is Haba Rakuto.</p>



<p>Thank you for reading “I Won’t Allow You to Have a Romantic Comedy With Someone Else(Watashi igai to no rabu kome wa yurusanai ndakara ne)” this time around. This LN is a rom-com that begins after the couple realizes their feelings for each other.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, it’s a story of a girl who’s antisocial and bad at communication but gains confidence little by little through an encounter with an ordinary yet caring boy.</p>



<p>I’m truly grateful for the connection we’ve made through this story.</p>



<p>Now, in this era where social withdrawal is encouraged globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, how has everyone been doing?</p>



<p>When I was writing the first draft of this work, I never anticipated a world where meeting people would become so difficult.</p>



<p>Fortunately, thanks to the technology of the internet, we can still communicate despite being miles apart. The latter part of creating this novel was done entirely through remote work, and it’s a relief to see it safely reaching all of you. If you enjoyed reading it, that brings me unparalleled joy as a writer.</p>



<p>While this story is fiction, there’s one personal experience of mine incorporated. That’s being nominated as the class representative by our homeroom teacher.</p>



<p>On the first day of high school, I was unexpectedly called to the staff room right after class. I went there nervously, wondering if I had done something wrong, only to find out I was being considered for the role of the class representative.</p>



<p>Of course, unlike the protagonist in this story, there was no falling in love with a beautiful girl from my class. Well, that’s because I attended an all-boys school.</p>



<p>To Editor Anan-sama, a fellow alumnus from an all-boys school, thank you once again for your support.</p>



<p>To Ikomochi-sama, the illustrator. I’m genuinely delighted that my fervent wish for you to bring the characters to life was granted. When I saw the character designs, there were Yorka and the others. Thank you for the splendid illustrations.</p>



<p>To all those involved in the publishing process, including design, proofreading, and sales, my sincere thanks for your contributions to this work.</p>



<p>To my family, friends, acquaintances, and colleagues, I’m looking forward to the days when we can casually go out for meals again.</p>



<p>Well, that’s it from Haba Rakuto. Let’s meet again in the second volume.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, Dexter here, representing the team. First, I’ll start with Happy New Year 2024 and whatever your goals or wherever you want to go achieve this year. </p>



<p>I would like to thank Alisa for translating this volume. Without her, this novel would never be out and would just collect dust. Thank you!!!</p>



<p>Thank you Kayl for providing the raw for this volume and brainwashing me to translate it.</p>



<p>Also, for this volume, I’m the one editing it as G-string, the usual editor is busy with Chiramune. </p>



<p>Additionally, OtakuZero Volume 1 is currently being translated by me alone, and it would be machine translated. But, I’m working diligently to give you the best edited machine translation(I’m using four machine translation to get the real meaning behind it)</p>



<p>Next, this year might probably be the busiest year for us and as behalf of the team, I’d like to apologize for any delay in the translation. </p>



<p>Finally, to those who review bomb the novel on Novelupdates “FU”.<br /><br />(If you like the translation don’t forget to support us <a href="http://ko-fi.com/plebiantranslation">here</a>)</p>
