<h3>Chapter 7: Honesty is Scary, But…</h3>


<p>It was the day of the class sports competition.</p>



<p>The gym was divided in half by a net, with basketball on one side and a heated volleyball match on the other. As the tournament entered its final stages, only the top four classes remained.</p>



<p>I, having been the referee for basketball, was about to take a break when I spotted Yorka, just done with her table tennis game.</p>



<p>“Oh, looks like you participated properly. Good job! Get any wins?”</p>



<p>Yorka strolled through the lively gym with a sullen expression.</p>



<p>“My serves weren’t landing. The table tennis ball is too small.”</p>



<p>“Good effort, though.”</p>



<p>“This should shut you up, right? Class rep.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t Miyachi with you?”</p>



<p>“She made it to the finals, so she’s still at the table tennis venue. She’s amazingly good, like a ninja—quick and agile.”</p>



<p>While laughing at her amusing observations, I took a moment to observe her jersey outfit.</p>



<p>“Is something off?”</p>



<p>“Rather refreshing, I’d say.” I answered honestly.</p>



<p>The stretchy material of the jersey hugged her figure perfectly, emphasizing her outstanding physique. The chest area seemed particularly tight, and the snug fit around her buttocks and thighs looked somewhat constraining. However, when I recalled the slender waist she revealed while swinging her arms during our game in the art prep room, I was left with a certain impression. The jersey, tailored to her height, vividly accentuated her well-endowed figure compared to the average.</p>



<p>“Don’t give me that pervy look.” She threw an audacious comment at a teenage boy. “By the way, aren’t you participating in the basketball game, Sena?”</p>



<p>“After this. It’s going to be a serious match against Class 2-B, which has many active basketball club members. Even though I’ve been exhausted from refereeing and running around,” I said, pointing the whistle hanging from my neck.</p>



<p>“You lack stamina.”</p>



<p>“I definitely have more than you.”</p>



<p>The remaining time in the basketball game unfolding before us was short, meaning my turn was coming up soon.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, Yoryor!”</p>



<p>Miyachi immediately spotted us and trotted over, her oversized jersey’s long sleeves swaying with each step.</p>



<p>“…Looks like you two have become quite close, Yoryor,” I playfully repeated the nickname.</p>



<p>“Miyauchi-san just started calling me that on her own.”</p>



<p>“But she’s nice, right?”</p>



<p>“She’s easy to talk to, I suppose.”</p>



<p>Honestly, I had my doubts, but asking Miyachi to look after Yorka turned out to be the right call. As the first person to expand Yorka’s circle of friends, there couldn’t have been a better fit.</p>



<p>Yorka, initially taken aback by the petite girl with blonde hair and piercings, seemed to gradually ease her guard with Miyachi’s soft demeanor and laid-back attitude.</p>



<p>Miyauchi Hinaka was another highly sociable individual. It could be said that Asaki-san was the technical type and Miyachi was the power type.</p>



<p>“Miyachi, good job. How was the final?”</p>



<p>“I won, of course!”</p>



<p>“Congratulations! Come on, Arisaka, congratulate her too.” I subtly nudged Yorka, who was standing behind me.</p>



<p>“Congratulations.”</p>



<p>“Thank you! It makes me happy to be praised by Yoryor.”</p>



<p>“If only Arisaka could express her emotions so openly,” I muttered under my breath.</p>



<p>“If you have a complaint, don’t look at me.”</p>



<p>“Looks like only those aggressive emotions that you’re honest about.”</p>



<p>“…Sumisumi and Yoryor seem to be quite close,” Miyachi offered her third-party perspective.</p>



<p>“Must be your imagination!” Yorka immediately denied it. But such overly sensitive reactions only made things more suspicious.</p>



<p>As expected, Miyachi directed a meaningful gaze at me alone.</p>



<p>The whistle blew, marking the end of the basketball game.</p>



<p>“Well, how about a little stretch?” I ascended the stage, making sure not to get in the way.</p>



<p>“Need a hand?” Miyachi casually offered, and Yorka’s expression twitched.</p>



<p>These situations were the trickiest. If Miyachi helped me, Yorka got jealous. And Yorka wouldn’t likely give a straightforward response if I asked her.</p>



<p>“Oh, or maybe you prefer Yoryor to do it?” Miyachi suggested, seemingly aware of my dilemma.</p>



<p>“──Mi-Miyauchi-san. You must be tired from playing a lot of table tennis. I’ll give you a massage.”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Yorka suggested taking care of Miyachi and stepped onto the stage herself.</p>



<p>“Then I’ll massage Yoryor too!” Miyachi enthusiastically agreed.</p>



<p>In the end, I was left stretching alone.</p>



<p>“Let’s start with Yoryor! I’ll support you well and make you all flexible.” Miyachi, now on the stage as well, wiggled her fingers and approached Yorka.</p>



<p>“I don’t need it, really!”</p>



<p>“Oh, don’t be shy. Yoryor, your bust is impressive, so your shoulders must be stiff, right? I’ll make you feel better,” Miyachi, praised by Yorka as a ninja, swiftly moved and began massaging Yorka’s shoulders.</p>



<p>“Waah, it’s so stiff!”</p>



<p>Yorka stifled an inaudible moan. The effect was outstanding.</p>



<p>“Uhhh, mmm…”</p>



<p>“Mmm, there, there. Is this spot good? Right here!” Miyachi continued massaging with a mysterious evil magistrate tone.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I started my warm-up exercises. It had been a while since I left the basketball team, so my sense of playing might be a bit rusty. Whether my shots will go in was uncertain. Given Nanamura’s relentless passing, I couldn’t afford to be too lax.</p>



<p>“Alright, next up, you sit and stretch forward. Yes, extend your legs in front of you!”</p>



<p>Under Miyachi’s extraordinary technique, Yorka was completely disarmed and found herself in a position she couldn’t resist.</p>



<p>“Whoa, Yoryor, you’re so flexible,” Miyachi commented, gently pushing Yorka’s back until she’s practically flat against the floor.</p>



<p>“That’s surprising. I thought you’d be as stiff as a board.”</p>



<p>“Sena ~, did you say something?”</p>



<p>“No, I’m just envious of your impressive flexibility.”</p>



<p>“…Yoryor, you make a cute face when you’re talking with Sumisumi,” Miyachi casually dropped her observation.</p>



<p>“Miyauchi-san, that’s a wild imagination.”</p>



<p>“Is it? I sense a bit of a special atmosphere,” she glanced at me again.</p>



<p>“Because Sena is Kanzaki-sensei’s minion and always gets in my way.” Yorka denied it outwardly with an indifferent tone.</p>



<p>“But you skipped the sports festival last year. Why bother coming this time?”</p>



<p>“Just killing time. Thought I’d watch Sena embarrass himself.”</p>



<p>“Hey, come on,” I protested. Not the most encouraging words for someone about to play.</p>



<p>“Sena, it’s your turn. Girls, cheer for us!”</p>



<p>I received a bib from Nanamura on the court.</p>



<p>“Alright, I’m off.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi and Nanamu, good luck! Yoryor, you cheer too,” Miyachi cheered us off with a victory pose.</p>



<p>“Arisaka, hold onto this,” I handed Yorka my discarded jersey.</p>



<p>“Why?” She looked a bit puzzled.</p>



<p>“Watch the whole game. Make sure to witness whether I embarrass myself or not.”</p>



<p>I put on my bib and headed to the match.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">—</p>



<p>Judging by the skills of the participating members, our Class 2-A against the formidable Class 2-B in this semifinal was practically the final showdown.</p>



<p>Even students who had just finished their games on the field gathered in the gymnasium to witness this highly anticipated match.</p>



<p>“””Nanamura-kun, do your best!”””</p>



<p>Cheers in high-pitched tones from girls of other classes reached Nanamura, who responded with a friendly wave.</p>



<p>“They’re confident, huh? The opponent has three members from basketball club.”</p>



<p>Five from Class 2-A and five from Class 2-B aligned themselves at the center line. The match duration was a ten-minute mini-game format.</p>



<p>Normally teammates, the basketball club members seemed eager to show some rivalry, especially toward Nanamura. This animosity was also a testament to the recognition of the basketball club’s ace.</p>



<p>Our Class 2-A, on the other hand, was not lacking in firepower. With both Nanamura and me in action, and the team formed with tactical brilliance by Asaki-san, we’re ready and motivated.</p>



<p>“With our combination, we can win.”</p>



<p>“Don’t underestimate my rustiness. My dribbling and passing are at their max,” I admitted hesitantly.</p>



<p>“The enemy thinks they can win if they contain me. They’ll focus on defending me, so use me as bait and you score.”</p>



<p>“I was told in this morning’s horoscope to avoid strenuous exercise as it could lead to injuries.”</p>



<p>“Sena, bring those old basketball shoes of yours!”</p>



<p>“I can’t pull off miracles in my indoor shoes.”</p>



<p>Apart from the basketball club members with their high-quality basketball shoes, the rest of us were in regular shoes.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan is watching. If you don’t perform, I’ll steal all the glory.”</p>



<p>“I really respect your confidence.”</p>



<p>“──It’s time to repay the debt from last year now.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to worry about it.”</p>



<p>The pre-game tension dissipated with light banter. I glanced at the stage, and my eyes met Yorka’s, holding my jersey.</p>



<p>“(Good luck),” her lips moved.</p>



<p>I was a cheap guy; that alone filled me with determination.</p>



<p>The game began.</p>



<p>Nanamura outjumped the ball and precisely bounced it in my direction.</p>



<p>“It’s so sudden!”</p>



<p>Without hesitation, I dribbled the ball into the enemy territory. As I thought, three defenders clung to Nanamura, expressing Class 2-B determination not to let him score. It was a common occurrence for those with talent to face interference.</p>



<p>The remaining two guarded the goal, ensuring no entry below. In a real game like this, unlike regular club activities, long-range shots were rarely successful. Therefore, almost everyone wasn’t wary of jump shots far away from the basket.</p>



<p>“──Well, I should give it a shot.”</p>



<p>Without passing, I stepped into my shooting form beyond the three-point line. The weight of the ball, the grip on my fingertips, the distance from the hoop – knees, elbows, and finally, the flick of the wrist.</p>



<p>The ball, tracing a graceful arc, sailed through the hoop as if irresistibly drawn in.</p>



<p>A three-point shot to take the lead.</p>



<p>The gymnasium erupted in cheers.</p>



<p>The faces of Class 2-B players changed. Sure, I might not be as skilled as them, and I quitted midway, but there were things I could do. Although it’s fine to underestimate me, misjudging might leave them be caught off guard.</p>



<p>“Nice shot, Sena!”</p>



<p>Nanamura extended his fist, and I fist-bumped.</p>



<p>“It’s just the first one. Keep going, keep going!”</p>



<p>“Fuuu~ Sena’s stoic~” Nanamura also joked enthusiastically.</p>



<p>The game unfolded with a rapid exchange of offense and defense.</p>



<p>Our strategy was simple. During defense, each player marked their opponents one-on-one. In offense, we first collected the ball to Nanamura. If unable to attack, I, a former basketball club member, aimed for the three-point shot. In case of a miss, everyone rebounded, seizing every opportunity for another attack. We passed the ball swiftly as a team until Nanamura broke free from the opponent’s defense.</p>



<p>“Sena-kun, I’m counting on you!”</p>



<p>The ball, once circulating among our teammates, found its way back into my hands. Without hesitation, I followed our strategy and took a three-point shot.</p>



<p>The ball smoothly slipped through the hoop once again, securing two consecutive three-pointers. Suddenly, we’re leading 6-0.</p>



<p>Class 2-B now had to be wary of my three-point shots. With their focus on me, the defense on Nanamura would slightly loosens. Seizing this opening, Nanamura tore through the opponents like a wild beast.</p>



<p>The other three players also seized their chances. Nanamura, now free, received a pass and deftly maneuvered, literally twisting the ball into the goal. Even if the opponents tried to block him forcefully, he scored with his exceptional physical abilities.</p>



<p>If the opponents concentrated too much on Nanamura, they left me vulnerable. After receiving the ball, I would consistently shoot from beyond the three-point line.</p>



<p>Inside, there’s Nanamura; outside, there’s me. Class 2-A established a good offensive rhythm, steadily accumulating points.</p>



<p>“All those extra hours practicing three-point shots paid off, Sena.”</p>



<p>“They wouldn’t know. I quit the club before showing it off.”</p>



<p>A year ago, Nanamura and I became close while practicing extra hours. That’s why only Nanamura knew about my secret weapon, the three-point shot.</p>



<p>Despite his boastful nature, he put in the effort equivalent to his skills, understanding the hardship of striving more than anyone. Because of that, he never laughed at my lack of skill.</p>



<p>“If you draw their defense, it makes it easier for me to attack, and vice versa.”</p>



<p>A secretly practiced combination play. I never thought the day to show it would come after a year.</p>

">
<p>I witnessed a side of him I never knew.</p>



<p>Sena effortlessly sank shots from afar with a beautiful form. Each ball he released seemed drawn to the goal, gliding through the net. The satisfying sound drowned by the uproar of the crowd.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, you did it again!”</p>



<p>Even Miyauchi-san’s shout beside me couldn’t distract me; I was engrossed in the game.</p>



<p>“…Do you know why Sena left the basketball club?”</p>



<p>For once, I initiated a question.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi quit to protect Nanamu.”</p>



<p>“Tell me more.”</p>



<p>“Nanamu is exceptionally skilled at basketball, and, for better or worse, he has a selfish personality. He often played solo, causing constant disputes with teammates in middle school. Even as a freshman in high school, he clashed with seniors because he instantly became a regular. In those situations, Sumisumi was always the mediator.”</p>



<p>“Sounds like Sena.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Thanks to Sumisumi’s support, Nanamu learned the importance of teamwork and became an ace recognized by everyone. However, an incident occurred during a practice game before the summer tournament.”</p>



<p>“An incident?”</p>



<p>“Nanamu’s former middle school teammate was on the opposing team. Maybe he wanted revenge for old grudges. During the game, there was clearly intentional foul, and Nanamu got injured. Sumisumi protested angrily, and he ended up getting punched.”</p>



<p>“What’s that? Violence is just awful.”</p>



<p>The recounted past events stirred a vivid anger within me. Then, I realized. The scar on Sena’s face that day when the oil painting fell—it was a mark from that incident.</p>



<p>“The situation developed into a fight involving everyone. Although he didn’t throw a single punch, he got kicked out because he was the cause of the brawl.”</p>



<p>“That’s absurd! Sena just spoke up for his teammate!”</p>



<p>I exclaimed with a surprisingly loud voice. The surrounding students all looked our way, but I didn’t care. Unbeknownst to me, I was glaring at Miyauchi-san.</p>



<p>“I agree. The entire basketball team protested too. Even Kanzaki-sensei stood up for him. But with so many spectators during the practice match, Sumisumi’s withdrawal couldn’t be overturned. Then Nanamu started expressing dissatisfaction with the school, threatening to quit, causing even more trouble.”</p>



<p>“…Why are two people who could reasonably sever ties playing basketball together?”</p>



<p>On the court, two guys named Sena and Nanamura displayed an impressive teamwork play.</p>



<p>“At the end, Sumisumi said, ‘I entrust basketball to you, Nanamura. Play for me too.’ He was able to persuade that stubborn Nanamura. It’s enviable how boys can clear things up and return to being friends…”</p>



<p>“Sena shouldn’t have to compensate for someone else’s immaturity.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t accept it as a heartwarming story. Essentially, it was a tale of an ordinary person sacrificed for exceptional talent. Regardless of noble sentiments about male camaraderie and beautiful friendship, I couldn’t reconcile with it.</p>



<p>Why should Sena, who worked hard for others, be the one at a loss?</p>



<p>“That’s Sumisumi’s charm. I think it’s wonderful that he can be genuinely committed for someone else’s sake.”</p>



<p>“It’s ridiculous to suffer because of complete strangers.”</p>



<p>──I was growing increasingly frustrated. After all, this situation mirrored my current relationship with Sena.</p>



<p>“You get angry too,” Miyauchi-san smiled.</p>



<p>“I’m just annoyed by Sena’s self-sacrifice. It’s absurd.”</p>



<p>“I like Sumisumi.”</p>



<p>Miyauchi-san suddenly expressed something incomprehensible.</p>



<p>“Are you sane? What’s good about him?” I took an unnatural and overtly negative stance.</p>



<p>“A person who can help when it really matters is cool.”</p>



<p>“Of all people, Sena Kisumi is tacky. It’s better to stay away!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t stop myself from talking more. The more I spoke, the more suffocated I felt. This girl truly understood the goodness of Sena Kisumi.</p>



<p>“Rest assured, I have no intention of stealing Sumisumi from you.”</p>



<p>“This has nothing to do with stealing.”</p>



<p>I was afraid I might reveal too much if I kept conversing with Miyauchi-san.</p>



<p>The gym erupted into a particularly loud cheer.</p>



<p>13 to 14.</p>



<p>After a tug-of-war game, Class 2-A was finally overtaken. Just one point difference. Twenty-three seconds left.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi looks tired. The next move will decide it,” Miyauchi-san murmured as if seeking agreement.</p>



<p>Sweating profusely, Sena was on his knees, gasping for breath. It was just a recreational sports event. For a guy with a hiatus mixing in with active basketball club members, he performed remarkably well. Despite his lack of innate talent, he gave it his all. He fought well.</p>



<p>The cheering battle between the two classes reached a fever pitch.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun! Just a bit more, lift your head! Make that shot!”</p>



<p>Hasekura Asaki, who appeared midway through the match, shouted encouragement.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi! Fight!”</p>



<p>Miyauchi-san, with her petite frame, also shouted at the top of her lungs, sending her cheers.</p>



<p>Amidst the multitude of voices, I found myself standing unconsciously.</p>



<p>“WIN THIS, KISUMI────────────!!”</p>



<p>For the first time, I called him by his first name.</p>
