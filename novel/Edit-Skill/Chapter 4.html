<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Meeting an Old Sister in a Closed Guild</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Ummm… We completed the quest right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “Yes you did.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In response to my question, the blue haired girl nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Right, she understands me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “This is the [Common Guild] right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “Yes. Like you’ve said, this is the [Common Guild].”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So I have not warped into another world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “This is a piece of [Large Bat’s Ears] proving my completion of the quest is it not?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “Yes it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “You know I’m not lying right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “I know. You guys killed all the Large Bats.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “This is my membership card. My name is Souma Nagi</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “I have confirmed it. The quest is over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I worked hard didn’t I.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “Yes you worked hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “It’s great isn’t it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “It is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Please give me the reward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “I can’t pay you. The guild has closed down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It feels like I’m listening to pre-recorded messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, maybe. I have no idea how many times I’ve said the same things already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So… The guild has closed down huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">These things happen regularly right? Nothing I can do about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Uh… Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “All the guild members were killed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “By who?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blue haired girl: “By the [Noble Guild].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “So you are&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “I am Leticia Milfey. A childhood friend of Aine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Saying this, Leticia returned me two guild membership cards/span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One that looks like the normal [Common Guild] membership cards.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bP9QDJ8/87927.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And another one that is made of metal, belonging to…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “The [Noble Guild]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “While I am Aine’s childhood friend, I also come from a noble family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Nobility? Then aren’t you one of the enemy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “That’s not a joke right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Raising her voice, Leticia slammed her fist against the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Please don’t group me with those idiots. Slimy aristocrats that don’t ever listen. Lots of them are useless with nothing other than pride. Even though we are all nobility, unlike them, I won’t run at the sight of an insect! Die! They should all die!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia continues hitting the wall out of anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “It’s ok to be angry, but can you please explain the situation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “It’s all because of the cursed sword.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">All because of the cursed sword…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The [Noble Guild] heard of the news…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What happened to all the [Common Guild] members who participated in the quest?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The [Noble Guild] can’t accept the [Common Guild] getting the cursed sword and becoming equals to them. Making use of an expelled member of the [Common Guild], they attacked the [Common Guild] members in the dungeon. Most were beaten up, only a few escaped. That’s all I know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Hold on. Aren’t the [Noble Guild] members really weak?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “They got a strong priest to support them by pressuring him to betray the [Iturna Cult].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “The [Iturna Cult] huh… The leader was a lower aristocrat wasn’t he.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The priest was a neutral party, so he switched sides under pressure from the leaders of the [Iturna Cult]. Can you imagine if your healer switched sides and join the enemy? More so if it happens during a battle with monsters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I know. It’s really bad.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What happens if your priest joins the enemy party in an RPG?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Your team lose healing magic while the damage your team deal to the enemy is healed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There is no doubt that reality would be a really shitty game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Isn’t it better to destroy that cult?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “I agree. Aine had protested about a lot of things to the [Nobility Guild]. And then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The count who is responsible for the [Nobility Guild] had said&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I know of no such outrageous acts. I wish that you would not accuse me of such baseless allegations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“That said, I understand your feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“So let us meet in the middle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I will get them to promise not to touch the [Common Guild].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“There must still be injured adventurers who cannot make it out of the dungeon right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Let us do our best and help them out. Of course, that’s assuming you accept my conditions.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “These conditions…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I have a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Despite not being able to doing much things</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having only pride and no ability. This is not a good situation to start with&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The entire [Common Guild] will become a sub-guild of the [Noble Guild]. Aine, the successor to the guild, will hand over all rights over the guild to the [Noble Guild]. In exchange, the [Noble Guild] will persuade the rebels and the [Iturna Cult] to stop. Additionally, the [Noble Guild] will also rescue the injured members of the [Common Guild]. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Sorry, I might have heard that wrongly. Could you repeat that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The entire [Common Guild] will become a sub-guild of the [Noble Guild]&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I knew it. My ears must be rotting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “My mouth is also rotting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “In the first place, why is Aine the representative? Isn’t there anyone else of higher rank?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The person who is actually in charge is Aine’s guardian.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “And what happened to this person?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “He ran away fearing the anger of the aristocrats”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Abandoning his workplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well. It might not be expected that the aristocrats would act to such an extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The [Common Guild] did not want conflict with the [Noble Guild]. They just wanted to get the cursed sword so that they can use it to negotiate with the [Noble Guild]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I can understand why Aine had collapsed on the table and fallen unconscious now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I agree that it is pretty shocking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For her to become responsible for the guild and then losing it all with a day…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “If that’s true, I should have worked harder to suppress the [Noble Guild]&#8230; I never expected my dad to do all that while I was sleeping… To wake up to this mess…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “What kind of father is that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “A coward. The embodiment of self protection. A powerful person who fears everything other than himself</span><span style="font-weight:400;">&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight:400;">I am getting sick just from talking about him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This man seems to be a decent person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, that would mean it is hard to change the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “This is really bad…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Is there no choice but to give up on the reward?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">You cannot expect to say “Please me my reward” in such a situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “By the way, what is your name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There was no change in the awkward atmosphere. Leticia looked at me questioningly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I&#8217;m Nagi, didn’t I show you my membership card just now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">……</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Wait… Are you </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;"> Nagi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Do you know me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Aine praised you! She said you were the best! She said you seemed really unreliable and very timid and cautious that one would subconsciously want to protect you! She could not stop talking about you seen I first met her! It’s the first time Aine has praised anyone so much!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Those are praises!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “It was love at first sight!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I don’t believe anyone could be so happy!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “She said she understands the feelings of the girls that were with you. wanted to protect you so badly that she was willing to become a slave to serve you. She was blushing while she was saying all of these! You really have woken Aine’s [Onee sister personality] from the depths of her heart&#8230; Can you please stop using her weakness to seduce her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Just what was so seductive about my actions!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I see. Does these kind of things happen if you pretend to be useless?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I really did not expect this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine had always felt like an older sister character to me, but I did not expect her to be so extreme</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “So you are Nagi… In this case… I can’t let the person that Aine had fallen for at first sight to go rewarded for his actions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia reached into her coat pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Please accept this as a compensation for the reward. After all, I am partially responsible for today’s incident too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Slow &#8211; Lv 1]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Magic] that [Delays] [Reaction Speed]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Magical Singing &#8211; Lv 1]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Song] that [Increases] [Magical Power]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “While these are common skills, you can still sell them for some money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sure, we got our reward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But… Why do I feel a pain in my heart?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Unknown: “Letty… Is that you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There was a soft voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Her thin body shivering, Aine opened her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fwaa… Aine yawned and rubbed her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine look at the Leticia who was next to her, and then she turned towards my direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Her vision focused as she looked as me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She gasped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She stared at me as if she was imagining things while she slowly stretched her hands out towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Na-kun…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Wha…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Na-kun! It’s Na-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Smoosh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Uh. Uh…. What is this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “You… Where did you go. You made me worry so much about you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Aine!? What are you doing!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “What kind of weird question is that. Aren’t I am your older sister?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Smoosh. Smoosh. Smooooooosh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What is this. What is happening?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Why are Aine hugging me? Why is she burying my face in her chest?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It feels hot. And soft. And it’s smells good… No it’s not like that.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/YZFK3HM/87928.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What do you mean “Na kun”?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I don’t think we are at that relationship yet?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Aine… It’s embarrassing to be called ‘Na kun’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Eh? But… But… I finally got to meet you after so much time!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “An older sister shouldn’t be doing things that embarrasses their younger brother right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Fine…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine pouted and released me reluctantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is different from yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Her usually neat hair had become undone. She looked like she was in a daze, as if she was half awake. Compared to the current her, the Aine who was explaining the quest details was much more alert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Could this be a result of the shock from having the guild taken away from her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia came up to me and whispered in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “&#8230;The past few years of Aine’s memory had been taken away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Her memory?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “It’s a warning to others. To indicate that Aine’s [Common Guild] is gone for good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “A locking skill?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “No. In this case, items with sacred power were used.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">One would certainly turn to sacred powers for recovery and support magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This would be equivalent to the priest class in games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, this is the work of some kind of psychic type magical power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The [Iturna Cult], is the work of the deputy bishop Argis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That guy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I should have eliminated him back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The current Aine has her memories in a mess. ‘Na Kun’ is the name of Aine’s younger brother who had died when he was young. His name was ‘Naias’ but your personality does resemble his.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So that’s the reason for why Aine was acting strangely, acting like she is my older sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">When we first spoke, she did say that I reminded her of someone she knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ahhhh… I remember it clearly now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I wanted to keep a strictly business only relationship with the guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Na kun? Is something bothering you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Before I knew it, Aine was staring at me with a face full of concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She’s too close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Uh… I am not ‘Na k</span><span style="font-weight:400;">─</span><span style="font-weight:400;">’.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “If something is bothering you, talk to your older sister ok? I’m doing this for your sake alright?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Like I’ve said…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Na kun, please don’t go away. We promised to keep the guild going together didn’t we? I’ll do my best. For Na kun’s sake, I will protect the guild… That’s why…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sniff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine started tearing up and crying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Is she remembering the memories from the time of her brother’s death?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “I’ll do anything for you to remain by my side. That’s right, how about we enter a [Contract]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “A [Contract]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Na kun, I remembered you saying that you wanted a slave that would do anything for you. If it means being together with you forever, I’ll become your slave!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Aine, please don’t get confused!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I mean, please don’t really take out a medallion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I will not. I am definitely not accepting a [Contract]!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Aine? Um… How old is Na-kun now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “6 years old right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Na-kun seems to be a very mature child!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “That’s right. How about we take a bath together? I’ll wash Na-kun’s body. Your elder sister loves that. Does Na-kun like it too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I have never ever experienced that in my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Did Na-kun not like baths?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I don’t dislike baths, but getting into a bath with a girl is a little…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “I see. So that’s why you would refuse to go in unless you are blindfolded and your hands are tied up. Jeez, come on Na-kun, don’t be so shy!.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I don’t think that’s him being shy but him truly disliking it!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “That aside, why are you in Aine and Grandpa’s guild?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Realising where she was for the first time, Aine looked around at her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Eh? Grandpa? Grandpa isn’t here? Dad and Mom had died a long time ago… Na-kun and Aine had always been with Grandpa… Ehhhh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine cowered, hugging her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “When Na-kun left… I swore to protect the guild where all of my memories came from. For that, I tried my best… I really did try my best… I tried…&#8230; Eh? What am I saying… I know, I’ll go make some tea and calm myself down… Hold on Na-kun.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine’s smile was forced and clearly full of pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Leticia. Is there any way to restore Aine’s memories?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Argis crystalised Aine’s memories and hid it somewhere. Aine should recover if you obtain that crystal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That guy really likes to do bad things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I am normally against working for free…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But seeing Aine heading to another room with a tea set&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Perhaps she’s boiling water because it is the start of Na-Kun’s tea time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even though this place will soon be taken away by the [Noble Guild]&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Taken away by a black guild…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Seeing Aine acting this way, I had almost forgotten about the ongoing problems&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I really can’t stand this. I just can’t.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I understand. Let’s go retrieve it right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “This isn’t a problem that beginners should poke their noses into.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia scratched her blue hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “There is no way that a level 1 or 2 adventurer can defeat a [Steel Gargoyle].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “[Steel Gargoyle]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “It is a statue that is completely made of steel and moved by magical power. Argis and the Count released it in the tower that hides Aine’s memories. It’s a punishment to those who disturb the town.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “How about you swear on the honour of nobility that you’ll stop hurting me with your words?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “No. I swear on the honour of nobility that if you manage to retrieve it, then you managed to retrieve it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “You’re the worst.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Do you really have to corner people so badly with your words?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Moreover, Aine’s memories are being guarded by the gargoyle and you’re not the one dirtying your hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This really rubs me the wrong way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “By the way, is the [Steel Gargoyle] a type of [Guardian]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “That is common knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Does it have wings growing out of its back and holds a sword and a shield?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “That would be a real high tiered [Guardian Angel]. The [Steel Gargoyle] is a statue modelled after a Gargoyle. Even though it isn’t as powerful as a high tiered enemy, I still think I should get a level 10 adventurer to take this on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words, if you can defeat the [Guardian Angel] in the demon race magician’s basement, then you can also defeat the [Steel Gargoyle].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I’ll manage somehow I guess. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Good grief. A [Steel Gargoyle] and a mad dog of an opponent. This is truly tiring.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Mad dog?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “The [Noble Guild]’s helper. Normally, the [Common Guild]’s people are stronger, but people say that this guy is stronger… Just how much stronger, I do not know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia held her head and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “It is said that he was hired by the caretaker of the [Noble Guild]. It seems that he was originally under the His Majesty’s command, but he was discharged due to his barbaric way of speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “&#8230; His Majesty&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “He seems to be under the impression that the guy was some sort of a legendary hero. Well… It is true that he possesses some powerful skills that even I have not heard about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “&#8230; Having skills that no one knows off…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “I think his name was “Tanaka Koga”. He might have changed his surname though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “&#8230; Surname, Tanaka…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Why do I have such a bad feeling about this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Unknown: “Why are the people from the [Common Guild] still here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The sound of a door being kicked open could be heard from the first floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A figure came up the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Unknown: “Don’t get in my way! This is the path of the brave! Come out and meet me you trash!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A boy in armour came into the office area on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Black hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Black eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Similar age to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If it were back in my world, he would be going to high school or something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The boy in armour, Tanaka Koga, whipped his cloak and declared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “As a hero recognised by the King, I order you in the name of Tanaka Koga! The remaining scums of the [Common Guild] will surrender to me immediately! Don’t resist or I will crush you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">To me though, I could only see him as a boy doing a chuunibyou cosplay.</span></p>
