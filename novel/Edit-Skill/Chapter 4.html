<h3>Chapter 4: Jealousy, the Hidden Flavor of Love</h3>


<p>Becoming Arisaka’s boyfriend and being able to contact her anytime enveloped me in a mysterious invincible feeling. It was the perfect start to my second year of high school. The relief from the agony and anxiety of not being able to reach her during spring break made me feel like I could fly now.</p>



<p>Even during class, my thoughts were consumed by my girlfriend, and the voices around me hardly register.</p>



<p>After school, in the homeroom, Kanzaki-sensei said, “Sena-san and Hasekura-san, please come to the tea ceremony club room. There’s something I’d like to discuss.”</p>



<p>But my destination laid elsewhere.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, let’s go together.”</p>



<p>Just as I rose to head to the art preparation room, I was pulled back to reality by someone calling my name.</p>



<p>“Huh, Asaki-san? Why?”</p>



<p>“Just now, Kanzaki-sensei told us to come to the tea club room. She does this every year when selecting class representatives. If Kisumi-kun and I are called together, it means I’ve been chosen as a class representative too. Definitely!”</p>



<p>The name of the lovely girl speaking with excitement was Hasekura Asaki. With a face that could easily fit into the entertainment industry, she smiled amiably. Her slightly bright brown hair fell to her shoulders, and the loose curls gave her a lively impression. Subtle makeup enhanced her natural beauty. The glossy lips draw attention effortlessly. Despite wearing the blazer uniform neatly, her nails and tasteful fashion added a touch of sophistication.</p>



<p>In the future, a popular profession like a female announcer would suit her perfectly. She’s a bit intentionally cute, but with her excellent interpersonal skills, she could turn the tables on those who acted aloof and make them her fans with just a conversation.</p>



<p>In short, Hasekura Asaki was the polar opposite of Arisaka. She was the central figure in our grade, a popular and attractive girl with a friendly and approachable demeanor, surrounded by many friends. While not as academically gifted as Arisaka, she consistently ranked among the top. She smoothly handled everything, and teachers held her in high regard.</p>



<p>Eisei High School, despite being a college preparatory school, was filled with numerous class activities. Under the guise of student-led initiatives, there were plenty of joint class committee tasks.</p>



<p>I was acquainted with Asaki-san because she served as a class representative in a different class last year. Because she referred to me as Kisumi-kun, I addressed her as Asaki-san.</p>



<p>However, it didn’t mean we’re particularly close. We exchanged brief words if we happened to meet in the hallway – just casual conversation between acquaintances. After all, Asaki-san remembered everyone’s names, even down to their first names.</p>



<p>“You’ve seemed lost since we entered our second year. If you have any concerns, I’m here for you.”</p>



<p>“Thanks. I’ll reach out if anything comes up.”</p>



<p>“Always happy to help. Well then, let’s go.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, got some stuff to do, so I’ll pass. Tell Kanzaki-sensei to pick another guy for class rep.”</p>



<p>“Wait a sec! This is a problem! Uh, you’re not coming with me?” Asaki-san hastily grabbed my uniform sleeve.</p>



<p>“You’ll be fine. Since Kanzaki-sensei values experience, it’ll probably just be a confirmation for you, Asaki-san.”</p>



<p>In Kanzaki-sensei’s class, the class representative was appointed by her every year. The moment I learned this year’s homeroom teacher, I was worried about being chosen. I really didn’t want to do it.</p>



<p>“Not that! You’re turning it down, Kisumi-kun? I thought you’d accept for sure!”</p>



<p>“I’d rather not have my after-school time taken away.”</p>



<p>It would interfere with my dates with Arisaka.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, you’ve already quit the basketball club, so you should have the time, right?”</p>



<p>“Well,” I started to say but hesitated. Dating Arisaka was a secret. It’s risky.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, Kisumi-kun,” Asaki-san said, peering at my face.</p>



<p>“Anyway, don’t mind me. If it were you, the work will go smoothly no matter who else is chosen.”</p>



<p>Everyone knew her leadership qualities. Excellent communication skills that made you want to follow her lead. There was no reason for her to hesitate now.</p>



<p>“My partner is only Kisumi-kun. Even last year’s cultural festival, thanks to your assistance, it went really well.” Asaki-san smiled, but her grip on my sleeve remained firm. “Plus, being chosen by Kanzaki-sensei two years in a row shows her trust in you. So, I hope you’ll help me get closer to Kanzaki-sensei.”</p>



<p>“Is Kanzaki-sensei really that infamous?” I asked with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“… Only Kisumi-kun would put it that way. Many girls admire Kanzaki-sensei with that Yamato Nadeshiko vibe. I joined the tea ceremony club because I wanted to be like her.”</p>



<p>“Don’t imitate her pushiness. I couldn’t refuse last year and reluctantly accepted.”</p>



<p>“Maybe Kanzaki-sensei saw something compelling enough in you to push so hard!”</p>



<p>“Your words can be deceiving.”</p>



<p>“I was genuinely worried about not getting picked by Kanzaki-sensei.”</p>



<p>“Is the class rep position really that popular?”</p>



<p>It was news to me. I’d gladly pass it on if there were other volunteers.</p>



<p>“I’m aiming for a university recommendation, I want to earn some extra credit.”</p>



<p>“You’re already thinking about that?” My head was full of the romance in front of me, college exams still felt distant.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, you seem reliable, but you’re surprisingly laid-back.”</p>



<p>“I often get used conveniently because of that,” I said self-deprecatingly.</p>



<p>“I’ll positively assess your kindness and flexibility. Anyway, even if you refuse, I’d prefer you to say it to her directly!”</p>



<p>“…Got it.”</p>



<p>Seems like I had no choice but to drop by the tea ceremony club room with Asaki-san. I glanced at Arisaka’s seat, but she apparently had left the classroom earlier.</p>



<p>During the walk, I discreetly messaged Arisaka, <em>“Got called by Kanzaki-sensei, so I’ll be late going there.”</em></p>



<p><em>Yorka: ‘Calling someone by their first name so casually, what kind of girl is this sneak thief?’</em></p>



<p>A forceful reply arrived at lightning speed. She noticed! And she’s extremely wary!?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, before I could reply, we arrived at the tea ceremony club room.</p>


<p>Upon entering the tea ceremony club room, our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki-sensei, welcomed us eagerly.</p>



<p>Kanzaki Shizuru, calm and polite in speech but rather sharp-tongued and casually strict, a Japanese-style beauty. Always maintaining a graceful posture, her back straight, and every movement deliberate.</p>



<p>True to her elegant image as a Yamato Nadeshiko, she served as the advisor for the tea ceremony club. Proficient in various traditional arts such as tea ceremony, koto, and flower arrangement, she excelled in all manners of artistic practices typically associated with the training of a bride.</p>



<p>Many affluent female students joined the club specifically to receive her guidance. Despite its unusual size for a cultural club, it had become a sort of social hub for the school’s girls.</p>



<p>Even though she was still in her twenties, she approached her teaching career with conviction, earning respect even from veteran teachers. She drew a clear line between teacher and student, avoiding undue familiarity. Yet, her keen awareness of subtle changes in students earned her considerable trust.</p>



<p>Even in a prestigious school, there were inevitably some misfits or troublemakers. Generally, students who required extra attention were reformed by Kanzaki-sensei and successfully moved on to university.</p>



<p>The quirky individuals of adolescence would obediently listen to Kanzaki-sensei’s words. Even Arisaka, who could be considered her natural enemy, listened only to Kanzaki-sensei. To be precise, it’s more fitting to say she was highly vigilant.</p>



<p>For me, she was a person whose inner thoughts were hard to decipher. I couldn’t grasp what she was thinking; she always maintained an expressionless demeanor. On top of that, she’d ask for outrageous favors with an indifferent tone.</p>



<p>I reluctantly slipped off my indoor shoes and stepped onto the tatami mat.</p>



<p>“Please, have a seat,” the teacher gestured, prompting us to sit formally, mirroring her seiza posture. “I would like to ask both of you to be class representatives.”</p>



<p>She was straight to the point, diving into the main topic. Almost the same lines as a year ago, I felt deja vu. Last year, overwhelmed by the solemn atmosphere of this tea ceremony club room and Kanzaki-sensei’s silent pressure, I couldn’t refuse.</p>



<p>But this year, I’m different!</p>



<p>“Understood. Thank you for trusting us, Kanzaki-sensei!” Asaki-san accepted with a response that could earn full marks.</p>



<p>“I must decline! Well then, excuse me!” I immediately stood up.</p>



<p>“Sena-san, please wait.” A calm but commanding voice slowed my escape. “Do you have something urgent?”</p>



<p>And with the second sentence, any hope of a clean getaway crumbled. Sensing that ignoring would lead to dire consequences, my legs had no choice but to halt.</p>



<p>“My youth is at stake here. Please don’t stop me!”</p>



<p>“That sounds serious. I’ll prepare some tea; let’s talk at ease. We have special tea and sweets today as well.”</p>



<p>Was rejecting not an option!?</p>



<p>“No, Sensei, really. I have plans…” I tried to resist somehow.</p>



<p>“──Did you say something?” Kanzaki-sensei maintained her smile.</p>



<p>She often encouraged student initiative. Just facing her sent a chilling sensation down my spine, and my rebellious spirit was instantly worn away. As always, even if the world were turned upside down, I had no confidence in persuading her.</p>



<p>“My legs fell asleep from sitting seiza. I’ll rest a bit until I can walk again,” I surrendered, seating myself again. I had already realized the inevitability of not being able to defy this.</p>



<p>“Just relax your legs. Hasekura-san, thank you for accepting. You may leave for today. I need to have a personal discussion with Sena-san,” the teacher said, starting to prepare tea.</p>



<p>“See you tomorrow, Kisumi-kun. Let’s do our best as class reps this year!”</p>



<p>Why did she sound like it’s a done deal? Asaki-san left with light footsteps.</p>



<p>It must be nice to escape this tense atmosphere. I was almost envious to the point of tears. The tension only increase when it’s a one-on-one with Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“Do you want to go home?”</p>



<p>“The tea is blameless. Once I’ve had it, I’ll take my leave immediately,” I replied in a relaxed position.</p>



<p>“Feel free to relax. There are no club activities today, so we won’t be disturbed,” she assured as the sound of the tea kettle boiling started to fill the room.</p>



<p>“Being alone with a student in a closed room after school is not the ideal image for a teacher, is it?”</p>



<p>“…Is that your preferred scenario?” Kanzaki-sensei seamlessly redirected my jest without disrupting her graceful motions of scooping tea.</p>



<p><em>Ping</em>, the subtle sound of a smartphone notification echoed in the quiet room.</p>



<p>“Sorry. I’ll switch to silent mode right away,” I said, glancing at the screen. The message was from Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p><em>Yorka: ‘You’ve read it, right? It’s not done yet?’</em></p>



<p>There’s no way I could reply in this situation. Plus, since I hadn’t responded to her previous message, she must be upset.</p>



<p>This is bad!</p>



<p>“Why can’t you take on the role?”</p>



<p>“I value my personal time.”</p>



<p>“Taking breaks is important, but if you play too much, your grades will suffer. Sena-san, you’re capable when you put your mind to it.”</p>



<p>Words of encouragement were overly emphasized. The pleasing sound of tea being whisked resonated through the tea room.</p>



<p>“Anything happen over spring break?”</p>



<p>“Why pinpoint that period?”</p>



<p>“I’ve been teaching for two years. I can sense changes in students.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“It’s quite evident.”</p>



<p>“That’s exaggerated. Students won’t undergo a miraculous transformation that easily.”</p>



<p>“Not really. Teenagers can change with minor triggers.”</p>



<p>“I’m not that outstanding of a student.”</p>



<p>“I wasn’t referring to you, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Here,” as the tea cup was offered to me.</p>



<p>“Excuse my rudeness,” I said, accepting the bitter tea and sweet namagashi prepared by the teacher.</p>



<p>“Let me be frank. I wish for Arisaka-san to expand her circle of friends even more. For that, your cooperation is indispensable again this year.”</p>



<p>“That’s another mission with a higher difficulty level than last year.”</p>



<p>The situation mirrored the one from last year when I was asked to be the class representative. My phone vibrated in my pocket. Probably another message from Arisaka.</p>



<p>“Sena-san, I’m asking this favor because you’ve been able to connect with her.”</p>



<p>“I was just chatting with her during lunch and after school.”</p>



<p>“This year, I want you to act as a bridge between her and your classmates.”</p>



<p>My phone vibrated again.</p>



<p>“…Honestly, I can’t imagine her getting along with anyone else.”</p>



<p>“That’s where your skills as a mediator come in handy.”</p>



<p>“Forcing normalcy onto someone like Arisaka doesn’t make sense.” I asserted firmly.</p>



<p>“I understand. Arisaka-san is unique. However, preferring solitude is different from isolation. In fact, she accepted someone like you as a confidant. A girl who typically rejects others became close to you. So, she can get along with other students too.” Kanzaki-sensei looked straight into my eyes.</p>



<p>“You have quite the expectations for Arisaka, sensei.”</p>



<p>“Not just for her. I have expectations for both of you.”</p>



<p>Delivering this statement with a calm expression, Kanzaki-sensei lacked subtlety. Her words carried an odd persuasiveness, as if they carried a convincing charm. Once you heard them, you almost want to believe.</p>



<p>I finished the remaining tea, “Thank you for the treat.”</p>



<p>“You’re welcome. So, will you accept?”</p>



<p>“For a year’s worth of reward, this tea alone feels a bit lacking.”</p>



<p>“…Then, how about me lending you a hand when you’re in a pinch?”</p>



<p>Not bad. Having Kanzaki-sensei’s support would be reassuring when needed.</p>



<p>“Ugh… I absolutely planned to refuse this year! Keep your promise about that reward!”</p>



<p>“Your goodness is part of your charm, Sena-san. Understood.”</p>



<p>As I stood up, my pocket started buzzing consecutively. It seemed Arisaka’s patience was running out.</p>



<p>I’ll be there soon, just wait a bit longer. I pressed my phone in my pocket, intending to soothe her.</p>



<p>“By the way, you and Arisaka-san are in the same class again this year at her request.”</p>



<p>“Huh, that’s news to me!?”</p>



<p>Even though I wanted to leave the room in a hurry, I couldn’t help glancing back. To my surprise, the teacher was right behind me. The tatami mats were slippery with socks, and as a result, I accidentally knocked the teacher over.</p>



<p>My phone, taking a tumble in the process, slipped out of my pocket.</p>



<p>“After the closing ceremony, she came to me for the first time, saying she’d quit school if you two weren’t in the same class.” the teacher calmly continued, lying beneath me without changing expression.</p>



<p>“Don’t speak so calmly! What’s with this rom-com development?”</p>



<p>“──Is this not the development you hoped for?”</p>



<p>“As if!”</p>



<p>“But, I must say, you’re surprisingly a gentleman for instinctively shielding me with your hand. However…”</p>



<p>“However, what?”</p>



<p>“The clasp on my bra came undone when I fell.”</p>



<p>“Are you kidding me with this nonsense?”</p>



<p>I inadvertently glanced at her chest. The spring outfit, with its thin fabric, clearly revealed the bra struggling to contain her ample bust. It was what they called the liberated bosom of an adult – to put it plainly, it’s huge!</p>



<p>“Um, it’s a bit too much if you stare so intently…”</p>



<p>“Sorry. Is, uh, it really that easy for it to come off?”</p>



<p>I tried my best to avert my gaze. While I wanted to pull my arm from beneath the teacher, making a wrong move could worsen the situation.</p>



<p>“I’ve been using this bra for a long time because it’s hard to find one that fits my size and has a design I like. And the ones that do are expensive. Probably an issue with the clasp…”</p>



<p>Quite vivid circumstances. Both my panicked question and her response were equally absurd. This wasn’t good; I’m starting to sweat nervously.</p>



<p>“So, um, what should I do?”</p>



<p>One of my hands was still behind her. If I released even a bit of the pressure from my other arm, my chest would collide with hers. It’s like being on Mount Everest with a high altitude.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/147081-1.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>My phone jolted again—vibrating forcefully on the tatami mat. It was practically causing a seismic disturbance.</p>



<p>“Believe it or not, I’m quite shaken too. If I scream and someone rushes in, it might lead to strange misunderstandings. I intend to become the principal and serve until retirement.”</p>



<p>“For goodness’ sake, show a bit more emotion!”</p>



<p>I hastily pulled my arm free, leaped to my feet, and retreated to the corner of the room.</p>



<p>“Could you turn away for a moment?” the teacher said, calmly fixing her disheveled hair and attire. Despite trying to focus on the wall to clear my mind, the rustling of clothes and any movement remained distracting.</p>



<p>“In many ways, I’ve had enough of this person.”</p>



<p>“Your phone seems to be unusually active, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>“Ugh, seriously! This is all your fault, Sensei!”</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to working with you again this year, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>And with this manner, Kanzaki-sensei smoothly dominated with her overwhelming poise, a quiet power play.</p>



<p>Unfair. Extremely unfair. Not only that, she dropped the bomb that Arisaka wanted to be in the same class as me only after accepting the role.</p>



<p>My homeroom teacher was indeed formidable.</p>


<p>I probably spent less than thirty minutes in the tea ceremony club room. When I was stepping into the corridor, Arisaka Yorka stood there, arms crossed, looking displeased.</p>



<p>“Arisaka!? Sorry, did you wait for me?”</p>



<p>“──Who’s that girl?”</p>



<p>“Are you talking about Asaki-san? She left before me.”</p>



<p>“Asaki?” Arisaka reacted sensitively.</p>



<p>“Just a way of addressing her. No hidden meaning.”</p>



<p>“What were you doing in there?” Arisaka furrowed her brows, glaring at me with a face filled with complaints.</p>



<p>“I was called in to be the class rep again this year.”</p>



<p>“It would only take less than five seconds, why did it take so long?”</p>



<p>“I wanted to finish quickly too, but…”</p>



<p>The instigator quietly emerged from the tea room.</p>



<p>“Oh, Arisaka-san. You’re still on school grounds?” Kanzaki-sensei feigned surprise quite blatantly.</p>



<p>“You certainly took your sweet time having a confidential chat with the class rep,” Arisaka remarked, her tone carrying a hint of sarcasm.</p>



<p>“Yes, indeed. We had some delightful moments together.”</p>



<p>“Oh, how thrilling. What delightful activities were you engaged in with a student behind closed doors?”</p>



<p>Both maintained a facade of calm, but beneath the surface, there was an underlying tension in their words.</p>



<p>“I’m curious too. Arisaka-san seemed like you were eagerly awaiting someone to emerge from this tea room.”</p>



<p>“What? No way!”</p>



<p>“Sena-san seemed to be in quite a hurry for some major events in his youth.”</p>



<p>“Why does Sena come into this!?”</p>



<p>“I see. But I was just stopping him for an important matter. If it’s unrelated to you, there’s no need for me to apologize.”</p>



<p>“Sensei, don’t provoke Arisaka too much,” I interjected.</p>



<p>“It took time because Sena-san resisted. If he’d cooperated, we would’ve finished quickly. Or perhaps he secretly wanted it to last longer? If he had said so, we could have gone out together today,” Kanzaki-sensei added, casting a meaningful look in my direction.</p>



<p>“What a load of nonsense! What were you doing besides accepting the class rep role?” Arisaka’s anger escalated.</p>



<p>“Absolutely nothing!”</p>



<p>“Yes, it’s our little secret. Remember, you mustn’t tell anyone.”</p>



<p>Wait, what’s with that way of saying it? I froze at her words, and Arisaka was left speechless. The teacher’s vague yet subtly embarrassed demeanor cast an oddly vivid silence over the scene.</p>



<p>Arisaka seemed audibly shaken, whispering something indiscernible.</p>



<p>“Sensei, um…”</p>



<p>“Oh, Sena-san. There’s tea on your mouth. I didn’t notice earlier,” Kanzaki-sensei said, using her handkerchief to wipe my mouth.</p>



<p>“────” “!?”</p>



<p>I froze, and Arisaka’s eyes widened in shock as if they were about to pop out.</p>



<p>“There, all clean now.”</p>



<p>“Even for a teacher, that was a bit much!”</p>



<p>“I secretly brewed tea for Sena-san, but it seems I’ve been caught.”</p>



<p>Embarrassing. At this age, having someone wipe my mouth felt awkward. I struggled with this unexpected childlike treatment. Honestly, was Kanzaki-sensei really shaken back then?</p>



<p>“Here you go, Sena-san. Have a pleasant afternoon.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei strolled back to the staff room like nothing happened. Was it natural or intentional? Either way, it had a profound effect on Arisaka.</p>



<p>“What the heck! That woman! Ugh, seriously infuriating! Isn’t that closeness a bit off? So annoying!”</p>



<p>In the school hallway, Arisaka, without a care, was more furious than I’d ever seen. This rage, distinctly different from her anger towards me, narrated how much of an arch-nemesis Kanzaki-sensei was to Arisaka.</p>



<p>“Arisaka.”</p>



<p>“What!”</p>



<p>“Thanks for getting angry.”</p>



<p>“Why are you thanking me!?”</p>



<p>Though it might seem like I was adding fuel to the fire, my heart was filled with a strange sense of contentment.</p>



<p>“If you didn’t like me, you wouldn’t be jealous, right?”</p>



<p>“If you were alone with a girl, of course I’d be wary!”</p>



<p>“If it wasn’t someone you liked, there wouldn’t be a need to wary, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s because she completely ignores boundaries.”</p>



<p>“I can’t reply when the teacher is around.”</p>



<p>“What’s more important, the class rep’s position or me?”</p>



<p>Could it be? The day when I get to hear that legendary line’s variation has finally come!</p>



<p>“Are you that worried?”</p>



<p>“Don’t boys constantly think about perverted stuff?”</p>



<p>“I indeed admitted that during the confession. But it applies only to my girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Despite looking like this, I always keep my promises and endure a lot.”</p>



<p>My words seemed to extinguish Arisaka’s anger in an instant. Now, she wore a puzzled expression. As she began to understand the meaning of my words, she suddenly took a step back.</p>



<p>“D-Don’t say weird stuff in the school hallway!”</p>



<p>“It’s the truth, what can I do?”</p>



<p>“Y-You’re just too honest. Show some restraint!”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t have confessed to Arisaka Yorka if I held back. I’m always desperate and sincere.”</p>



<p>I gazed into the eyes of the girl I had fallen for.</p>



<p>“…Sena seems more composed. l don’t like it after all!” Arisaka turned her face away and started walking alone.</p>



<p>“Alright, my bad. Yorka-chan. Yorka-chan, don’t go home alone.” I playfully used her first name.</p>



<p>“Don’t call me by my first name in the hallway.”</p>



<p>“Then, is it okay if we’re alone?”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>“You can call me Kisumi too.”</p>



<p>“I won’t.”</p>



<p>“Aw, that’s sad.”</p>



<p>“Don’t get carried away!”</p>



<p>“Yorka-chaaan.”</p>



<p>“The ‘chan’ isn’t needed!”</p>



<p>I circled around her.</p>



<p>“Yorka.”</p>



<p>This time, I called her name with sincerity.</p>



<p>“O-Only when we’re alone, okay?”</p>



<p>Even though her face turned red, she seemed happy somehow.</p>



<p>Because I loved her deeply, I realized something──</p>



<p>Pushing things might hurt her, but holding back was no good either.</p>



<p>I wanted to be gentle to this girl, who’s more timid and awkward than anyone else. Even though she was more beautiful than anyone, I wanted her, the one lacking confidence, to always be happy.</p>



<p>There’s no need for her to be jealous. I was already captivated by her.</p>



<p>Because I love this girl dearly.</p>
