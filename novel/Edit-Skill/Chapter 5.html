<h3>Chapter 5: Skipping Class Together</h3>


<p>I had officially become the official class representative for Class 2-A.</p>



<p>Eisei High, despite being a college-prep school, indulged in an abundance of school events. The significant task that class representatives undertook early in the new academic year was organizing the class sports competition.</p>



<p>Outdoor events included football(soccer), baseball, tennis, while indoor options span basketball, volleyball, and table tennis. As these were recreational, the primary goal was to deepen bonds among new classmates. Therefore, the emphasis was on enjoyment, and rarely did a class went all out for victory.</p>



<p>“Let’s aim for a complete victory since we’re doing it! Here, I’ve prepared some materials.”</p>



<p>The exception to this norm was our class, Class 2-A. Setting high goals with a smile is Hasekura Asaki.</p>



<p>As the other class representative, I had been summoned to the classroom early in the morning. I was a bit sleep-deprived from chatting with Yorka on LINE until late last night, but I had to stifle my drowsiness and offer my input as her partner.</p>



<p>Asaki-san, seated in front of my desk, handed me a sheet of paper containing the compiled information on the sports experiences of all our classmates from elementary to high school, along with an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of other classes. The idea was to create a winning strategy based on this data.</p>



<p>“This is impressive. How did you manage to gather all this information?”</p>



<p>“I have lots of friends. When I asked, everyone was willing to share. For information about Kisumi-kun, I got the intel from Nanamura-kun and Hinaka-chan.”</p>



<p>Contrary to her glamorous appearance, she didn’t slack on meticulous preparation. I admired her practical side. The materials were also very well-presented.</p>



<p>“…Speaking of which, you don’t refer to Nanamura by his first name, huh?”</p>



<p>“He’s the ace of the basketball team. Many first-rate jocks have fans among the girls, so getting too close might attract unnecessary enemies. Besides, I’m not really into the whole tough-guy image.”</p>



<p>It seemed she calculated her moves carefully. Quite impressive.</p>



<p>“Calling me by my first name doesn’t bother you?”</p>



<p>“I’m just adding a touch of familiarity as your partner. It’s not a big deal, right?”</p>



<p>“Please stop. My girlfriend might get jealous.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Are you dating someone, Kizumi-kun? Who?”</p>



<p>“It’s just a morning joke. Ignore it,” I denied.</p>



<p>“Someday, Kisumi-kun will find a wonderful girlfriend too. So, let’s do our best as class representatives!”</p>



<p>I was being sympathized with and then urged to focus on work. What a pitiful combination.</p>



<p>“Just do it normally…” I yawned as I glanced through the list.</p>



<p>“If we win, it could become a great memory of our second year, you know?”</p>



<p>“We don’t need to be that serious about a recreational event.”</p>



<p>“Your motivation is really low. You’re the one who suggested discussing in the morning, so we’re doing it now. What’s wrong with you?”</p>



<p>“I’m not the kind of class rep who’s all about being high-minded.”</p>



<p>There were only the two of us in the classroom. Of course, I’d prefer to stay in bed until the last minute, but after school was the time I wanted to reserve for Yorka. If it meant ensuring time with my girlfriend, I’d endure the struggle of waking up early.</p>



<p>“Let’s do our best together. If we don’t lead the class, who will?”</p>



<p>She’s dazzling. Watching someone like Asaki-san, beautiful, intelligent, and with a high level of loyalty to the group, made me acutely aware of the contrast with my own laxity and laid-back attitude.</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-sensei doesn’t expect that much. Sure, she pressures us to do the bare minimum, but whether we go beyond that is mostly left to our own initiative.”</p>



<p>Even though she still left a considerable silent pressure to encourage that initiative…</p>



<p>Anyway, I just didn’t want my time with Yorka to be reduced. If we ended up having morning practice and I had to participate due to my position, it’s going to be tough. Cut me some slack here.</p>



<p>“…Strange. If it were other boys, I feel like they’d be a bit more cooperative.” Asaki-san mused.</p>



<p>“Why not just tell Kanzaki-sensei, ‘He’s useless, replace him with someone else’?”</p>



<p>“Impossible! Not only would nothing good come of it, but my evaluation would also plummet.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t your enthusiasm mainly because you’re aiming for a recommendation?”</p>



<p>“Well, I come from a single-parent household, so I want to save money.”</p>



<p>“That’s impressive.”</p>



<p>An unexpectedly candid revelation. I had assumed she came from a more refined background.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re finally showing some interest. Kisumi-kun, are you that curious about my private life?” Asaki-san teased.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t stare at me like that.” I wasn’t immune to women, so I ended up needlessly getting nervous.</p>



<p>“I thank my parents for giving birth to someone cute like me.”</p>



<p>“But I never hear you talk about having a boyfriend. Are you hiding something, perhaps?”</p>



<p>Maybe even Asaki-san had a secret lover, like Yorka and me. She was always at the center of social circles, with many friends. Although she often took the most prominent roles in events, specific rumors about her dating someone were nonexistent.</p>



<p>“My priority is not romance. Doing what needs to be done is crucial, and if someone good comes along, that’s a bonus.” </p>



<p>The popular girl smiled. I envied her for being able to attract the attention of the opposite sex without even realizing it.</p>



<p>“And what about you, Kisumi-kun? Are you single too? It’s surprising, given how popular you seem.”</p>



<p>Here it goes—the cliché line that girls said to boys they’re not interested in. If I really was popular, just chatting like this should have captivated any girl’s heart.</p>



<p>“Do we really need to delve into that topic?”</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re trying to dodge it. Could it be you like Arisaka-san?”</p>



<p>“Why bring up Arisaka’s name?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, the name of my girlfriend came up. My heart pounded.</p>



<p>“I heard it from Kanzaki-sensei. Last year, you were the one Arisaka-san talked to when she didn’t talk to anyone else. It could be because you share special feelings.” Asaki-san lowered her voice.</p>



<p>“Do you think so?” I played along with her teasing, intentionally.</p>



<p>“Sorry, I lied. The two of you dating would be impossible!” Despite trying to keep a serious expression, Asaki-san bursts into laughter. “Ah, are you angry?”</p>



<p>“Nah. It’s not like anyone would believe we’d make a good couple.”</p>



<p>Hearing the evaluation from an outsider, I deeply felt that. A cool beauty and an average guy—normally, such a disparate couple wouldn’t work.</p>



<p>“…Sorry if that came as a shock. But you know, it would’ve been quite convenient for me if you and Arisaka-san were a couple.”</p>



<p>“Convenient?”</p>



<p>“If I got close to you, I could probably stir up Arisaka-san’s emotions, right?”</p>



<p>“And why would you do that?” I asked, curious about her intentions.</p>



<p>“As long as Arisaka-san is around, I can’t grab the top spot in the exams!” She looked incredibly frustrated.</p>



<p>“The way you say it already sounds like a lost cause.”</p>



<p>“But this year, I’m absolutely going to take first place!”</p>



<p>The immovable first place and perpetually second place. Since the beginning of high school, the rankings had been firmly established. Of course, being in second place was impressive, but it was clear that Asaki-san wasn’t satisfied.</p>



<p>“Hey, do you think there’s a strategy to pull Arisaka-san down a bit?”</p>



<p>“Seriously!?”</p>



<p>She was innocently declaring her plan to kick others aside.</p>



<p>“Just kidding. Putting others down isn’t my hobby. That’s why I make an effort to have everyone lift me up!”</p>



<p>Asaki-san took out her smartphone, expertly taking a photo of our working scene. A selfie with a face that said, “Working hard since morning,” she quickly added a bunch of hashtags and posted it on social media.</p>



<p>“Don’t upload images that give off a hint.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. Besides, since I mentioned that I’m doing the class rep’s work, everyone will assume that you’re also here.” </p>



<p>“Even so, isn’t it better not to casually hint at a guy’s presence in the picture?”</p>



<p>“It’s fine if it’s you, Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Feels like I’m being trusted, huh?”</p>



<p>“Indeed. Take it as an honor.”</p>



<p>“Don’t you say that to everyone?”</p>



<p>“Good guys don’t say such vulgar things.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san’s smartphone soon became noisy with notifications of likes and comments. Everyone on the train during their commute must have checked it. She perfectly factored in the time until the start of school day.</p>



<p>“You see, taking the initiative like this will make decisions in homeroom much quicker, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, results follow when you don’t neglect preparation.”</p>



<p>“Exactly. Now, let’s think about the ideal lineup.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san pocketed her smartphone, adopting a serious expression as she focused on the materials. We needed to get things done. I joined in the earnest contemplation.</p>



<p>When concentration sets in, discussions naturally heated up. Thanks to the prepared data, the optimal lineups were decided one after another. The only matter left undecided was what to do with Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, what did she do last year?”</p>



<p>“I asked her preferences, but she didn’t have any particular requests. In the end, she claimed to feel unwell on the day and stayed in the infirmary.”</p>



<p>“That sounds like slacking off.”</p>



<p>“I can’t openly ask a girl why she’s skipping PE. Since it was permitted by Kanzaki-sensei, I don’t have much to say about it.”</p>



<p>“I hope she participates properly this year.”</p>



<p>“How?”</p>



<p>“If you feel like giving up from the beginning, you won’t achieve anything.”</p>



<p>“Arisaka is a tough one.”</p>



<p>“Speaking from experience, huh? But maybe it’s different between girls.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san was confident in her communication skills. That’s interesting, then I could just entrust her with it. If it reduced my workload as a class rep, I’m all for it.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, the classroom became lively with members of sports clubs finishing morning practice and those who arrived early.</p>



<p>Amidst the commotion, I didn’t immediately notice.</p>



<p>When I felt an intense gaze and looked up, Yorka was glaring at me.</p>



<p>“Alright, I’ll leave Arisaka’s participation to you, Asaki-san! That wraps up this morning! Good job!”</p>



<p>The explanation I hurriedly sent to Yorka via LINE was splendidly ignored, and we couldn’t even have lunch together at noon.</p>



<p>I sensed a brewing storm ahead.</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>“To strengthen class unity, let’s aim for victory in the sports festival!”</p>



<p>During the extended homeroom period, Hasekura Asaki, standing at the podium, declared once again.</p>



<p>“I’m counting on the participation of those involved in club activities or with experience. Take the lead and bring us victory! I used to be in the tennis club in middle school, so I’ll be playing tennis!”</p>



<p>Asaki-san, fully determined to win, took the initiative to mention her preferred event as discussed in the morning meeting. Following the plan, experienced individuals were prioritized for each competition. With a grasp of the strengths and weaknesses of other classes, we strategically assigned those with good athletic abilities to events where we had a better chance.</p>



<p>Under Asaki-san’s practiced coordination, I jotted down the names of confirmed participants on the blackboard.</p>



<p>“Sena, you obviously will play basketball, right?”</p>



<p>Nanamura Ryū raised his long arm.</p>



<p>With outstanding agility and a well-endowed physique, he had been the ace player since his freshman year, scoring points with agile movements on the court. His short hair complemented his ruggedly handsome face, and his confident and assertive attitude made him popular among the girls.</p>



<p>“I’ll be in the background, mainly handling refereeing on the actual day. At best, I’ll be a substitute. Oh, and for those who understand the rules, please consider helping with refereeing too. If we leave it to the club members alone, our break times will be reduced.”</p>



<p>Not particularly interested, I casually brushed off his comments and addressed students with sports experience.</p>



<p>“Huh? If you don’t pass the ball, I’ll have to do all the dribbling.”</p>



<p>“Even with just Nanamura, we can still win.” I responded indifferently.</p>



<p>“Hasekura-chan, we need former basketball club member Sena to win, too.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Since Class B has a full lineup from the basketball club, when you’re up against them, Sena-kun should be able to participate after he conserves his stamina. Okay, now onto the next event.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san, skillfully rallying the participants, continued smoothly. When almost everything was settled, Asaki-san finally turned her attention to Yorka.</p>



<p>“What about Arisaka-san?” She posed the question casually, like a gentle breeze.</p>



<p>Up to this point, Yorka had shown no interest, seemingly disinterested. A glaring lack of enthusiasm.</p>



<p>Not only did Yorka not see Asaki-san’s SNS beforehand, her mood still not improved since the morning. The timing couldn’t be worse to bring up the subject.</p>



<p>Although usually indifferent with a cold gaze, which she cast at anyone without much interest, she was now staring back at Asaki-san with open hostility.</p>



<p>“Uh, even if you look at me with such a scary face…”</p>



<p>“──This face is natural. I don’t think it’s appropriate to attack a person’s appearance.”</p>



<p>If this were a joke, it would be an elite-level gag that only a beauty like Yorka could pull off. Unfortunately, she was dead serious. What’s more, she was probably the only one in the class who could speak to Asaki-san, the class beauty, with such open hostility.</p>



<p>Yorka’s voice was rigid and sharp.</p>



<p>The lively classroom suddenly became quiet due to the tense atmosphere. Yorka seemed to be aware of her influence but didn’t actually grasp it at all. For now, it looked like Kanzaki-sensei was just observing the situation.</p>



<p>“I just want to decide things in a way that aligns with your wishes, Arisaka-san’s. Honestly, that’s it!”</p>



<p>“I’m not interested.”</p>



<p>“Everyone is basically participating.”</p>



<p>“Weren’t the other class rep in the back also hesitant to join?”</p>



<p>Don’t suddenly use me as an excuse to slack off!</p>



<p>“As the organizer, I’ll mainly be a referee and only as a substitute player in basketball.” I interjected.</p>



<p>“Sena, don’t you dare back down from basketball,” Nanamura immediately chimed in, adding unnecessary commentary.</p>



<p>“Shut up, things are getting complicated!”</p>



<p>“─Who are you telling to shut up?”</p>



<p>Yorka, who had become overly sensitive, directed her anger towards me. Whoa, her eyes were burning with red fury.</p>



<p>“No, not Arisaka, I meant Nanamura!”</p>



<p>“You’re taking this recreation way too seriously.”</p>



<p>“I agree on that. Personally, I find school events pointless. But some people want to create memories and we’re just doing our class duties. No one has the right to dampen that, even Arisaka.”</p>



<p>I handled my interactions with Yorka with caution as a class rep, making sure our romantic relationship remained undiscovered.</p>



<p>“…I thought Sena was on my side,” Yorka lowered her eyes and mumbled softly.</p>



<p>Honestly, my girlfriend was beautiful and intelligent, but communication wasn’t her strong suit. On top of that, she’s strong-willed and a bit of a worrier.</p>



<p>She didn’t need to worry—I’m always on her side.</p>



<p>I put down the chalk I was holding.</p>



<p>“I’ve never become your enemy even once, Arisaka.”</p>



<p>Our eyes met, and I noticed everyone’s gaze converging on Yorka. From the expressions around, I could sense what they were subtly thinking.</p>



<p>“This talkative side of Arisaka-san was new.”</p>



<p>“Seeing her get angry like that was a first!”</p>



<p>“Arisaka in that state was less “beautiful” and more on the cute side.”</p>



<p>“Gap moe!”</p>



<p>“Anyway, I’m glad to be in the same class as Arisaka-san and Hasekura-san.”</p>



<p>“I’m on Team Miyauchi, though.”</p>



<p>“Wait, who just said “Miyauchi” now!?”</p>



<p>“The class rep is amazing for talking confidently with Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“What’s up with this atmosphere? What now?”</p>



<p>Yorka, standing abruptly as if bounced off her seat, left the classroom without a word.</p>



<p>“Sensei, I’ll step out for a moment.”</p>



<p>“Permission granted.” Kanzaki-sensei, who had maintained the silence, promptly responded.</p>



<p>“Asaki-san, go ahead and finalize the remaining members. I’ll bring Arisaka back.”</p>



<p>With the teacher’s approval, I also dashed out into the hallway. In the quiet corridor, the echo of Yorka’s footsteps reverberated. She was surprisingly fast, I hurried to catch up with her.</p>



<p>I was expecting her to head to the art preparation room, but she dashed up the stairs instead. Following the sound of footsteps, I found Arisaka Yorka on the stairwell leading to the rooftop.</p>



<p>“Why do you always find me so easily… I don’t want to see you.”</p>



<p>“Do you never want to see me again?”</p>



<p>“Just for a while. Dummy.”</p>



<p>“I’m relieved.” I ascended the stairs slowly.</p>



<p>“What’s there to be relieved about?”</p>



<p>“That I can rush to my girlfriend’s aid.”</p>



<p>“…Sena, is it alright for you to leave the classroom? Like, did no one suspect anything weird?”</p>



<p>Yorka worried if my actions would be perceived as a boyfriend looking out for his girlfriend.</p>



<p>“Unless we announce it ourselves, no one will think we’re dating. Just as you wished.”</p>



<p>We’re such an incongruous couple at this point. In the eyes of our classmates, I must have looked like a guy chasing after a displeased beauty out of duty.</p>



<p>I settled on the stairs.</p>



<p>“Let’s talk.”</p>



<p>“Talking won’t change a thing,” Yorka insisted, not moving from the corner of the stairwell.</p>



<p>“I want to talk. I mean, I’ve got a good excuse to skip class.”</p>



<p>“You’re not a serious class rep.”</p>



<p>“Blame Kanzaki-sensei for picking me.”</p>



<p>“Fair enough,” my girlfriend flashed a faint smile.</p>



<p>To ease Yorka, who had relaxed in tension, I patted the spot next to me. She hesitated but sat down a couple of fists away from me.</p>



<p>──Even as a couple, we still felt distant.</p>



<p>“But I’m also grateful to Kanzaki-sensei,” I said.</p>



<p>“There’s nothing to be grateful for.”</p>



<p>“It’s a good story. Just listen.”</p>



<p>“I hate stories involving other women.”</p>



<p>Finally, that innocent feeling from when we were in the art prep room returned.</p>



<p>“But really, I’m grateful to Kanzaki-sensei for telling me about your hiding spot. Without that, we might not be dating.”</p>



<p>“That’s where you should have confessed as if your life depended on it.”</p>



<p>“See? You wouldn’t have confessed yourself.”</p>



<p>At my words, Yorka puff out her cheeks. Those large eyes seemed to say, “it must be you,” as she glanced at me.</p>



<p>“Are you skipping the sports festival this year too?”</p>



<p>“If possible, yes.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s answer surprised me. It wasn’t a definite decision to skip but a conditional “if possible.” It seemed like a sign of change for Yoruka.</p>



<p>“So, worst-case scenario, you’d still participate. That’s a win for your boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Not for your sake! I just felt like it this year.” She mumbled, her embarrassment evident.</p>



<p>Honestly, it was endearing. Seeing your partner change in positive ways after getting together was truly gratifying.</p>



<p>“Yet,” I resisted smiling. “You ended up causing a fuss in class and running away.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to bring that up.” Yorka squirmed.</p>



<p>If she’s inclined to skip, she could have casually decided on the event like last year and simply taken the day off if she wanted. If she wanted to participate, she could openly express her preferences.</p>



<p>A beautiful girl who didn’t want to stand out but ended up doing so anyway. The reason for the commotion with Asaki-san despite not wanting to draw attention to herself in front of classmates.</p>



<p>“Is it possibly my fault?”</p>



<p>Yorka fell silent, refusing to answer.</p>



<p>“…It seems Arisaka Yorka is also wary of other girls.” I mused for a moment before muttering.</p>



<p>Her anger the other day, after me leaving the tea club room, likely stemmed from her arch-nemesis Kanzaki-sensei and the fact that she had been kept waiting. However, in this case, it was evident that this morning’s incident was still lingering.</p>



<p>“Are you feeling bad?”</p>



<p>“It’s part of my duty as a class rep. Don’t worry, unlike Yorka, I’m not popular or anything.”</p>



<p>“But it bothers me, and I don’t like it!”</p>



<p>“Then, should I only talk to you for the rest of my life?”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s a bit extreme…”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t mind. I like you enough for that.”</p>



<p>For me, now and forever, there’s no one but Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>“Huh!?”</p>



<p>Her surprised voice echoed in the stairwell.</p>



<p>“Ugh, I guess I’m just a cheap girl who gets happy from sweet words like that.” Yorka, now calmed down, put on a troubled smile.</p>



<p>“You’re more like a high-maintenance flower. Just have more confidence and stand tall.”</p>



<p>“Impossible.”</p>



<p>“Has my feelings not gotten through to you yet?”</p>



<p>“It has, sufficiently. But I’m just not good at being confident.”</p>



<p>“Is it because you don’t like being watched by others?”</p>



<p>I recalled her concerns she shared with me before.</p>



<p>“I don’t understand why people praise me. I mean, I’m just ordinary, aren’t I?”</p>



<p>“Where!?”</p>



<p>Yorka’s statement caught me off guard. Could it be that this girl has a ridiculously misguided perception of herself?</p>



<p>My exaggerated reaction left Yorka looking bewildered. Well, maybe her perspective was just too different from that of most ordinary people.</p>



<p>“Yorka, who do you compare yourself to when you think you’re ordinary?”</p>



<p>“My family.”</p>



<p>“Do you have any family photos?”</p>



<p>“I think my sister sent some. Let me check,” Yorka searched her phone and showed me a picture of her family.</p>



<p>“Wow, your parents are stunning. No wonder you and your sister turned out so beautiful.”</p>



<p>A picture-perfect, affluent, and blissful family. The photo clearly conveyed the immense love her parents had for their two daughters. There was no doubt it was a household filled with affection.</p>



<p>“Only my sister resembles our parents.”</p>



<p>With that statement, I feel like I’ve turned into a stone Buddha.</p>



<p>“W-What? Did I say something weird?”</p>



<p>Anyone could see that Yorka and her older sister appeared as a pair of beautiful sisters. The most notable difference would be that her sister, like their parents, wore a bright smile, while Yorka carried a somewhat shadowed expression.</p>



<p>“Sniff…”</p>



<p>“Why do you look like you’re about to cry, Sena?”</p>



<p>“Can I hug you?”</p>



<p>Yorka moved away from me from two fist-widths to one hip-width apart. “Wh-What are you doing? Even if there’s no one around that’s…”</p>



<p>“Those who work hard deserve a reward. I thought you might need it.”</p>



<p>“Why would hugging be the natural progression in this conversation!”</p>



<p>“Don’t you really get it?”</p>



<p>“W-What?” Yorka seemed to vaguely realize her reaction was off, but she was reluctant to admit it.</p>



<p>“You grew up in an environment that sounds like a joke, with an incredibly high level of family background. From the starting point, the hurdles were ridiculously high. It’s not a matter of competence; it’s just that the benchmarks are too high! You don’t need to feel inferior!”</p>



<p>People tended to consider their upbringing as the standard and often perceived their daily lives as ordinary. However, the sense of normalcy varied between households.</p>



<p>“But my parents work all around the world, and my sister has always had a lot of friends.”</p>



<p>“People have strengths and weaknesses. It’s not strange for a quiet person like you to be born into a sociable family!”</p>



<p>“But, everyone in my family has so many hobbies and is incredibly active, and I just don’t have anything I’m passionate about.”</p>



<p>“Being active isn’t an obligation. Yorka, you just haven’t found what you genuinely love or are interested in yet. You should take things at your own pace.”</p>



<p>I understood how energetic people could seem dazzling. After all, such vibrant individuals were easily noticeable in their surroundings. However, that didn’t mean one should blame oneself for not being that way.</p>



<p>Personality and temperament played a significant role. Even a quiet person might become exceptionally eloquent and active in a specific area. Humans were multifaceted.</p>



<p>“I don’t feel like I have any special talents when I’m just doing what I have to, like studying.”</p>



<p>“You won’t be the top student just by doing things normally! If you can achieve better results than others without forcing yourself, that’s an impressive skill.”</p>



<p>“But my family can all do it, so I can’t feel proud about this.”</p>



<p>She wouldn’t listen.</p>



<p>“If you measure yourself against your family standard, it’s no wonder that you aren’t moved by others’ praises or admiration.”</p>



<p>Finally, it clicked.</p>



<p>The girl I liked had been too fixated on not reaching the same level as her family due to her earnest nature. Because she was already exceptional, she remained unaware of her constraints. Human assumptions were powerful, acting both as a force that supports us and as chains that bind us.</p>



<p>“…Am I weird?” The person in question still hadn’t caught on.</p>



<p>Because of her being an unapproachable beauty, she reached today without being criticized by her peers.</p>



<p>Since she had no friends.</p>



<p>“──Poor thing.”</p>



<p>“Hey!?”</p>



<p>She seemed to feel humiliated by my sympathy, and she suddenly pounced on me. Overwhelmed by her momentum, Yorka ended up pushing me down.</p>



<p>For the first time in a year, Yorka’s face was right in front of mine. This time, she was on top.</p>



<p>“…This feels familiar. Should we do something naughty?”</p>



<p>“As if that would happen!”</p>



<p>“Too bad.”</p>



<p>“I’m not horny!”</p>



<p>“Skipping class, being alone with my girlfriend in a secluded place. It’s impossible not to get excited.”</p>



<p>“You obviously don’t mean that.”</p>



<p>“…Who knows?” I said and, daringly, wrapped my arm around her waist.</p>



<p>In an instant, Yorka quickly sat up, distancing herself from my arm. Blushing, she hid her chest with both arms but remained perched on top of me.</p>



<p>“How do you plan to explain the situation if someone sees us like this?”</p>



<p>“Umm… we’re doing a wrestling match?”</p>



<p>“That sounds way too suspicious.”</p>



<p>“You’ll probably talk your way out of it like you always do.”</p>



<p>Yorka, feigning composure, gently moved away from me.</p>



<p>Phew. I’d been putting on a tough act, but I was a total mess inside. The sensation of her soft thighs and the dangerously close position of her rear—it could have been precarious if it was a bit different.</p>



<p>“It’s nice to be relied upon as a guy.”</p>



<p>“Maybe I got conned by a bad guy into accepting the confession.”</p>



<p>“You had the whole spring break to think about it.”</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, Sena, you’ve been calling me Yorka too much since we got here!”</p>



<p>“Did you just realize it now!?”</p>



<p>“How two-faced can you be? You call the class rep by her first name, and the moment we’re alone, you try to do naughty things!”</p>



<p>“If I wanted to do naughty things, I wouldn’t bother asking for permission.” I stood up first.</p>



<p>“Beast! Don’t come any closer! Enemy of women!”</p>



<p>“Can you keep your greatest ally away? How are we going to get back to the classroom?”</p>



<p>Yorka, evidently aware of her blunder, let out a frustrated sigh.</p>



<p>“Having only a beast as my ally is quite unfortunate.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be so picky. So, what’s the plan? Handle it on your own, or leave it to me?”</p>



<p>I extended my right hand. Yorka hesitated, reaching out but not quite holding.</p>



<p>“Yorka…”</p>



<p>“W-Well, I mean, we’re going to hold hands, aren’t we!?”</p>



<p>“…We’re dating, right?”</p>



<p>“Of course!” Her response in this context was quite energetic.</p>



<p>“…Alright, let’s go back.”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>“Yorka, we’re going!”</p>



<p>I took Yorka’s right hand and pulled her up. It was easy. Her hand, which was I held for the first time, was smaller and softer than mine.</p>



<p>“…Eh, wha-!?”</p>



<p>“Don’t be so loud; Your voice echoes here.”</p>



<p>She closed her lips and stared at our linked hands “We’re holding hands.”</p>



<p>“Since it’s right hand to right hand, this is technically a handshake.”</p>



<p>When I tried to loosen my grip, Yorka tightened hers.</p>



<p>“Yorka?”</p>



<p>“…It just feels like a waste to let go.”</p>



<p>“──Then, let’s properly hold hands.”</p>



<p>I repositioned my hold on her left hand, intertwining our fingers. A hand-holding only between lovers.</p>



<p>“This is the right way.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have sweaty hands or anything, right?”</p>



<p>Even with a flustered expression, Yorka didn’t let go.</p>



<p>“Shall we let go?”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>“Only until we get down the stairs.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to go back to the classroom.”</p>



<p>“…Just five more minutes.”</p>



<p>I sat down again, still holding hands. Yorka, sitting next to me, leaned in closely and rested her head on my shoulder.</p>
