<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Hero Came and I fought Him with my Slaves</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Disgusting leftover scums of the [Common Guild].”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems to me that Tanaka Koga has seen me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He had a large double edge sword on his back and his expensive looking armor was embedded with gems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But I don’t recognise him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">From his name, I can clearly tell that he is like me, summon here by the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “The adventurers of the [Common Guild] are ordered to vacate immediately. Move it before I break your limbs, you scum!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “No matter how you look at it… Black hair, black eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems like he has seen us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Our gaze met but he didn&#8217;t show any sign of familiarity at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Similarly, I don’t seem to recognise him at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “So… You are the Hero nominated by the King?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Ah… That’s right, do keep that in mind from now on. You’re beyond hope aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Did you sign the [Contract] to save the world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “So you know about that too! I see. I am a _____ from _____!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I could see his mouth moving, but halfway through his sentence, the words [Another World] and [Visitor] were silenced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Just as I thought. He was summoned here too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">But… I don’t remember seeing him when we were summoned here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Perhaps he was summoned here separately?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I see. So the King choose you and [Contracted] you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Oh no, the nobles acknowledged my strength. They felt that instead of saving the world, it would be more appropriate to have people working under me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finishing, Koga gave me a thumbs up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems like the King sold this guy to the nobles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “I received this set of armor and sword from the nobles. It cost hundreds of thousands of Arushas to make them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I looked closer at the part of the armor covering his neck and saw a choker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Yeah, that’s definitely a choker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “I [Contracted] to work with this sword and armor for my entire life!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Uh… Yeah, that’s amazing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">For some reason, I feel sad for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">What’s with the commitment for this [Contract]? Why didn’t anyone stop this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In other words… This guy can’t leave this world before he defeats the Demon King as he [Contracted].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Then he was sold off to the nobles where he was given equipment and his [Contract] was changed accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The reason he couldn’t say the words [Another World] and [Visitor] was also because of the terms of his [Contract].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So that’s how it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s really not nice to summon cheat characters from another world and ask them to fight for you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Tanaka… I’ll wish you luck, so please try your best to live on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “O… Ok?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “See you. I’ll pray for you and hope that you will find your happiness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Ah. Well then… Wait, that’s not the point!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga was about to take his leave when he remembered why he was here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Damn, I almost fooled him&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Stabbing his sword into the floor, he shouted, “In the dungeon, the adventurers from the [Common Guild] retreated too quickly, so I didn’t get enough chances to fight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga raised his sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Your luck runs out here! This is where you die!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Don’t touch Na-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine threw aside the tea set and stood between me and Koga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Aine: “Don’t you dare hurt Na-kun! [Rainbow Colored Defense Wall LV 6]!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Instantaneously, a rainbow-coloured barrier appeared across the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Defenses against all attributes… Not bad but I have magical resistance!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga reached extended his hand and brandished the gauntlet on his hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The rainbow-coloured barrier shattered into pieces and disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Get out of my way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga shoved Aine aside roughly. Aine crashed into a table and collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Stop this Tanaka! Any more violence and …”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia thrust her rapier at Tanaka, trying to break up the fighting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So fast! Is she using an acceleration skill?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Your name makes me a little fond of you but please disappear at once!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga looked towards my direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I activated my skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Transcendence LV 1!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The world became black.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Smell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Taste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Everything disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s a really creepy feeling and I really did not want to use this skill…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That said, I was the perfect one to use this high risk, high return skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I shook my head from side to side and raised my arms…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Then I collapsed to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Though I couldn’t feel the ground, it felt like my body was rolling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I tried to raise my arms but they fell lifelessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I couldn’t take much more of this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Blurgh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I vomited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Skill… Off&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That. Was. Not. Fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Ugh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I feel sick and the world was spinning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I sat on the floor trying to recover myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">How much time has past? 30 seconds? Seems like it was the same as when I tested it&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Tanaka has been…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga who was originally by the staircase has now collapsed by the wall behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Alright, I succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Yo… You are…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia hugged Aine close to her and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “There’s no way you are a beginner adventurer! You countered Tanaka’s attack with inhuman precision then threw him using his momentum!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Ah, so I did that huh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Seems like I had parried Koga’s attack with my sword then grasped his arm and managed a judo throw using his momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That said, I was stilling feeling queasy and laid on the ground unable to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A high risk, high return skill indeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The skill “Transcendence LV 1” enhances the 6th sense in exchange for disabling the 5 senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">During this time, the body would respond automatically to the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I can use it once a day for a maximum of 30 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, due to the stress it places on the body, there is a side effect where I am unable to move for 3 minutes after using the skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl and Rita had told me that it would be a very bad idea to use it if they aren’t by my side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Leticia, how about we have a deal…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “A deal?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Since you’ve seen my abilities… In exchange for keeping them secret, we will help Aine out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Wha…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “However, the [Contract] will come after our experiment to see if we can defeat the [Steel Gargoyle].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Wha… What are you talking about!? Do something about Tanaka first!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This guy…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A cheat character from another world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sure he is strong but I feel like I’m still missing information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Skill activate [High-speed Analysis LV 1]!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A window containing statistics appeared in my sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Leticia Milfey], [Aine Clunette], [Tanaka Koga] and some other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Even though it was a short fight, it gave me quite a fair bit on insight on Koga’s status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Tanaka Koga]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Class: Swordsman</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Weapon: Hagane’s Longsword</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Armor: Blessed Armor (Reduces the effectiveness of magic)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As expected, I did not recognise his skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga shook his head and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">His right arm was bent in an odd manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The throwing move uses the momentum of an attack against the user. To think that it was sufficient to destroy his arm… As expected of a cheat character…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “You bitch… What did you do to me, the hero! There is no way a character of this world can win against me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Dear hero, how does it feel to receive one of my attacks?”</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Are you an idiot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Do you like this world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Uh… What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Do you feel any dissatisfaction about this world?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Nope. When I came to this world, I got affirmation for the first time in my life. That much made me satisfied with my new life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “There is one thing I’m dissatisfied with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Wha… What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “There are no hair dryers in this world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “HUH???”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga stared at me with a face of confusion and surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “My companions have long hair which takes a long time to dry. When we get into the bath, I’d dry their hair for them. Of course, we keep our clothes on. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to stay under the roof with them. What? Do you find this situation amusing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “You… Could it be…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I mean, they don’t have a hair dryer so I figured it’d be easier if I helped out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “You’re the same as me, are you not?”</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “That’s not important. Right now, I’m talking about the fascination of washing my companion’s hair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “What are you talking about…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Anyways, I used to think that it was a hassle to dry their hair, but recently, that has changed. I’ve come to enjoy the look of damp hair. Plus the nape of their necks… Brown or white skin are both great!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Seriously, who are you… Are you the same as me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Listen carefully. Compared to becoming a hero, the hidden charm of Cecyl and Rita are clearly more important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “You… Just die already!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Hmmm… Maybe this counts as a kind of moe too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s a nice topic. Drying the hair of my companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I saw something through the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">At a glance, it looked like animal ears but you could see it as a tail too…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There it is again… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Perfect timing, I am now certain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">My attempt at time buying was a success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems that Rita has noticed the weird atmosphere in the guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rather, the lack of presence of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka’s bloodlust spiked!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Naturally, Rita could tell this using her [Awareness] skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I see you’ve arrived, my slave, Rita Melpheus. Now, let us defeat the enemy who has hurt our guild master!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “I understand your wish, master.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Breaking through the window, a blonde swung through the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A blast of [Sacred Power] hit Tanaka on the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga turned and swung his sword&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Wha?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita had seen through Tanaka’s movement and swooped low while elbowing Tanaka’s wrist, negating his attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “How dare you turn your sword against my master…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita’s eyes lit up with bloodlust as she stared at Tanaka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita struck the sword with her fist, causing Tanaka’s grip to weaken momentarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “I’m not just gonna kill you. I’m going to break all your bones and put you through a world of pain&#8230; You’re going to regret attacking me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Rita! That’s the [Acceleration] skill!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">My [High-Speed Analysis] displayed the details of Tanaka’s skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems that more information becomes available as we fight…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Additionally, due to the master-slave contract, information is also transferred from Rita to me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Careful! That skill doubles his attack speed! I’ve disabled his right arm, so that’s a blind spot! Also, his armor is hard, so aim for the exposed parts!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka’s [Inherent Skill] allows him to have [Double attacking speed].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">His is able to swing his sword, which is about the same size as him, two to three times the normal speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In short, he is able to attack twice in the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “Got it! It’s dangerous, so please fall back!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Understood!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I carried Aine and Leticia with my arms and quickly headed downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The [High-speed Analysis] skill was still active though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I should look deeper into Koga’s skill and status…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “That guy is a swordsman class, magic is ineffective against him! His base speed is high but his intelligence is low! I think he’s weak to provocation!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “Thank you! Also, sorry about being late!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Don’t worry! I calculated! I’ve already memorised how long it takes for you guys to bathe!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “That sounds really pervy!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “It is also part of a master’s duty to know the condition of his slaves!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “Why do I find this pervier despite this explanation?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Please ignore that feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “No way!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">While bantering, Rita weaved around, avoiding an attack and countering with a roundhouse kick to Tanaka’s head. However, the kick was blocked by Tanaka using his gauntlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “While it’s embarrassing that you know so much, it’s still better than you not caring about us! Wait… So what am I supposed to do?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “How about we have a chat later at home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “That’s not fair! Cecyl would be there too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “You guys are being noisy!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After some time, Koga hit the wall with his sword.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Stop messing around! Who are you?! His companion?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “I have no intention of speaking with someone who is trying to kill someone important to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita stared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “You too! Being protected by a woman! And you’ve never stopped rambling! If you’re not going to fight, then shut up!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Ah&#8230; Sorry about that, but I’m afraid I that’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I moved one step to the left while talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After a short pause, I stared at Koga and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “After all, you would have noticed Cecyl’s magic chant if we were silent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “My anger. The manifestation of my blood. A blade that carries all of my fury…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">My [High-speed Analysis] skill tells me the status of people around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “Turn my anger into retaliation. Turn it into a fist that will not stop until the enemy is obliterated. No compromise. No mercy. Destroy. Destory. Destory. Let loose the blades that will burn everything and bring about the end…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s why I was aware that Cecyl was climbing the stairs while chanting her [Ancient Magic].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl who had just taken a bath was out of breath and panting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Her silver hair was braided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">So cute!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, she is releasing an extreme aura of bloodlust!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl looked up with absolute determination to kill the enemy!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “Spirit of fire, destroy the enemy with a million flames! [Flame Arrow]!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl had finish the chant for her [Ancient Magic: Flame Arrow]!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A magic circle appeared behind her small body&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">From there, a few arrows of flame appeared and flew towards Tanaka&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">These arrows accurately landed on Tanaka…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">And burst into sparks and disappeared!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Is that lvl 1 Fire Magic?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka laughed and put down the gauntlet that he was using to protect his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “My armor has magic resistance! Your arrows of flame feels like nothing more than a mosquito bite to me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">KABOOM!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Out of the magic circle came more arrows of flames, impacting on Tanaka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “So, tell me again, tell me that they are ineffective!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">KABOOOOOOOOOM!!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">An endless stream of arrows continued appearing and attacking Tanaka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">They flew around the room, attacking Tanaka from all sides!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">4 arrows, 8 arrows, 16 arrows! The amount of arrows appearing were increasing by the second!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka: “Useless. This is nothing! Useless!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka: “This gauntlet… 60 percent… reduction…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka: “Hey… This is&#8230;. How much longer…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka: “Sto… Hey… This… This bit of pain will not stop me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">KKKKKKKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka: “STOP! STOP! STOOOOOOOOP! IT HURTS!!! STOP! I’M GOING TO DIE!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl was panting hard from the exertion…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Cecyl, stop! That’s enough!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl’s face had turned red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s a sign of excessive use of magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The skill [Ancient Magic: Flame Arrow] has the characteristic of constant firing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It will keep on shooting the flame arrows until the user’s magic power runs out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “I’ve hurt Nagi-sama… I’ve tried to kill Nagi-sama…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl seemed to be confused from the exertion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “I became a person who tried to kill Nagi-sama…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I’m not hurt! Look, I’m fine! You didn’t hurt me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Really. Look, I’m completely fine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “Can I check you carefully later to make sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I get it, I get it! So stop! You’re going to collapse at this rate!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “I… Understand…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Finishing, she finally stopped swaying and collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With that, the torrent of flame arrows came to a halt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She got up again and unsteadily made her way to me before falling to her knees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl: “I can’t stand not being sure that Nagi-sama is unhurt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I’m fine… I managed to get to cover in time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl’s breathing was getting heavier by the second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Hey&#8230; Hey! Stay with me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Cecyl fell asleep in Nagi’s arms, breathing lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi, on the other hand, breathed a sigh of relief after realising that his worries were unfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Seems like I have a few things that I’ll have to think about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If we have to take baths and change clothes separately, that would cause a significant amount of worry for each of us…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">An apartment with a bath… Not a dormitory but a cheap rental house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “Hey Nagi… What do we do about this guy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Turning back, Rita looked at Tanaka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Koga: “Scaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscaryscary…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Tanaka was muttering while he stood there smoking, burnt all over and missing half his hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sure, the [Blessed Armor] has a magic reduction ability that makes the [Arrows of Flame] feel like mosquito bites. However, humans can still die if they’re stabbed by a huge number of mosquito bites.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “I can have the finishing move right? Can I?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She placed one foot on top of Tanaka’s head, ready to crush it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Don’t dirty your foot, you just took a bath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Rita: “Yes master.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “It was the Earl who hired Tanaka, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I looked towards Leticia who was staring at the scene dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Ye… Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She replied after taking a short breath to compose herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “He was the one who order this guy to attack the [Common Guild].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Any idea what we can do to retaliate?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “I don’t think there’s much that we can do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She shook her head with a tired expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I can’t agree with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “He’s the same person who confined Aine who tried to oppose them. The aristocrats cannot complain if the tables get turned on them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If you decided to stir trouble within your opposition, you should expect opposition from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “If you insist…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In any case, we better get out of here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I left Cecyl to Rita.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Despite the fact that both of them were sweating hard, they still smelled good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Then, I carried the unconscious Aine to a chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Actually, she looks asleep rather than unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “First, let us have a discussion, Leticia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “About?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I owe Aine. First, she referred a quest to us in secret. Then, she gave us a skill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “So?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “So I want to help her. However, we’ll be risking our lives in the fight with the [Steel Gargoyle]. Hence, I have a favor to ask of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Help… I could use some of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia looked at the defeated Tanaka in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It seems that she acknowledged our strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “So, what is the favor that you need from me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “We’d like a moderate-sized and sturdy place to stay. Hopefully, you can introduce us to such a place at a cheap price. Ideally, it should have more than 2 rooms and have a bath built in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">After a little bit of thinking, Leticia said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “I have a vacation house in the port city of Irugafa. I inherited it from my dead mother, so the ownership belongs to me. As for my dad, he doesn’t know about it. If you don’t mind, I can lend it to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “What about the rent?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “If you take care of it, then you can use it for free.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Thank you, that’s really helpful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With this, we have obtained a place to stay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Ever since I came here from the original world, I did not have a place to settle down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">There simply is no way that we can keep up that kind of lifestyle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Next, do you know any place to sell the [Blessed Armor]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “[Blessed Armor]?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “This guy’s.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">I pointed at Tanaka Koga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With my foot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “This would just happen again if he still has his equipment. Isn’t it better if we take away his equipment? However, throwing them away would be a waste, so we should sell it. Could Leticia help us sell it? You can have half of the profit as a commission cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Well, that much I can do&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I’ll leave it to you then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Yes. However, please give my half of the profit that Aine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia turned to look at Aine who was still sleeping on the chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “She took care of the members of the [Common Guild] till the very end. She was trying to raise funds so that everyone could leave the town and start afresh elsewhere. The commission fee can go to that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “You can have 70% as the commission fee…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “You really are kind, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I don’t want to be in debt. As of now, I’m also a member of the [Common Guild].”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Anyways, it is dangerous for us, do not have the proper connections, to sell the [Blessed Armor].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “Lastly, I would like you to wait till around noon tomorrow before officially accepting the request.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With a regretful look, Leticia said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Aine’s memory will disperse with time… It seems that the Bishop used an item that sets a time limit of three days. If you cannot regain her memory before the time limit, her memories will be lost forever…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “I will get it done in time. Before that, I need to check the skills of my team to see if we can complete the quest. It would be troublesome if we showed up to the tower and find it impossible to defeat the [Steel Gargoyle].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “That is true.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “We can’t afford to sacrifice our friends here, so let us officially enter the contract at noon tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia paused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “Who are you guys? You guys aren’t some low-level adventurers right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nagi: “We came just to have fun. While our level is low, when the pieces of the puzzle come together, we can do things that no other people can do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Leticia: “I don’t get it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">That’s alright, even I am unsure myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Now, I should head back to the inn, let Cecyl rest and tell them about our plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, time to impose on you, employer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">We waved and left the [Common Guild] building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Transcendental sense LV 1]</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">By blocking the five senses, I will awaken the sixth sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Can be used for 30 seconds.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">During which any attacks will be countered.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">Additionally, if there is a chance, I will attack in the most optimal fashion, including the use of other skills.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">However, it can only be used once a day due to the stress it places on the body.</span><span style="font-weight:400;">
</span><span style="font-weight:400;">It is a little worrying that I am unaware of my movements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It may also target friendlies, so they should stay clear before the skill is activated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">[Ancient Magic: Arrows of Flames LV 1]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Creates a magic circle behind the user which shoots arrows of flames until the user’s mana is depleted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">While the damage is low due to it being a LV 1 skill, the threat comes from the continuity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Think of it as using low damage projectiles to shave away at the opponent’s health in a fighting game until the time runs out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Having to guard against the projectiles, the defender will be suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If the opponent starts to chant this spell, it would be best to escape at once.</span></p>

<p>My friends over at Raising The Dead will be taking over the series from now on. I couldn&#8217;t really keep up with the amount of work so I was really slow at updating. Best of luck to them on the series ^^</p>
