<h3>Chapter 11: That Love Stands Out Too Much</h3>

<p>It was the Monday after the weekend when Yorka stayed over at my place.</p>



<p>Walking to school, I felt peculiar gazes from those around me. It was like everyone was staring. When I turned around, a fellow second-year student quickly averted their eyes. This happened several times.</p>



<p>“What’s going on?”</p>



<p>After I changed into my indoor shoes and headed toward my classroom, I was approached by two unfamiliar third-year girls.</p>



<p>“Hey, are you Sena-kun from the second year?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s me,” I replied cautiously.</p>



<p>The two girls exchanged curious glances and one of them straightforwardly asked;</p>



<p>“──Is it true you’re dating Arisaka-san?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Why would you ask such a thing, Senpai?”</p>



<p>I immediately pretended to be a kind underclassman and asked in a cheerful tone, as if I was very surprised.</p>



<p>My acting seemed to have its desired effect. They were visibly disappointed.</p>



<p>“There’s a rumor that someone saw Arisaka-san being seen off by you at the station on Saturday morning. Did you really spend the night out?”</p>



<p>“Wait, Arisaka-san, the Arisaka Yorka in my class?” I feigned surprise, acting like this was unrelated to me.</p>



<p>“Oh, is it someone else?”</p>



<p>“Did Senpai witness it firsthand?”</p>



<p>“Not really, but…”</p>



<p>I see. Someone must have seen us parting ways at the station, and by this morning, the rumor had spread like wildfire in this age of social media.</p>



<p>“Is there any evidence for this rumor?”</p>



<p>“I don’t know. No photos or anything; it’s just the rumors reached us.”</p>



<p>At least I could be relieved that there were no covertly taken photos.</p>



<p>“So, are they really sure it’s me and Arisaka-san? And do you seriously believe we’re dating?” With a touch of self-deprecation, I countered the circulating rumors.</p>



<p>The two third-year girls exchanged glances again, as if silently agreeing, “Yeah, right.” They seemed to accept the improbability of such an odd couple.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, is it really Arisaka-san? Could they have mistaken her for someone else who looks similar?”</p>



<p>“Haha, maybe. We apologize for asking weird questions.”</p>



<p>The third-year girls quickly walked away from me.</p>



<p>I shed the mask of a confused underclassman approached by unfamiliar seniors and pondered the situation.</p>



<p>Although I managed to divert the attention of those who didn’t witness directly, explaining to every student who heard the rumor wasn’t feasible. Time, place, and not just Yorka but even I had been identified. Someone had undoubtedly seen the scene.</p>



<p>The saying “walls have ears” was so true.</p>



<p>Everyone was keenly interested in other people’s romances. Without photographic evidence, it wasn’t confirmed information but rather a rumor. Nevertheless, it probably had spread extensively throughout the school.</p>



<p>After all, it was the first gossip related to Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>“I hope Yorka is okay.”</p>



<p>My primary concern was Yorka. Insignificant types like me already had low visibility within the school, making it easier to deflect rumors.</p>



<p>However, for someone as strikingly beautiful as Yorka, mistaking her was a challenge. Her beauty was on a different level than your average.</p>



<p>The more people heard this, the more likely they were to omit details and add speculation. This was the mechanism behind rumors. Baseless nonsense spread from mouth to mouth as if it were a matter of fact.</p>



<p>Soon enough, my unremarkable existence would be cast aside, and the sole rumor would be Yorka spending the morning with a guy.</p>



<p>“Damn, I was so careless.”</p>



<p>While climbing the stairs, I muttered under my breath.</p>



<p>On that day, I wasn’t exactly my usual self. Well, who would be after spending the night with a girl you liked? I couldn’t just go about my day as if nothing happened.</p>



<p>Yorka initially declined my offer to see her off, but I couldn’t bear to part ways, so I used “strolling in the morning” as an excuse and walked with her to the station.</p>



<p>It was a fact that Arisaka Yorka had stayed out overnight. While the reality was far from scandalous, with enough material to fuel gossip, perception was everything.</p>



<p>“…It’s my fault.”</p>



<p>When I entered the classroom, I felt probing glances from all directions. Yorka hadn’t arrived yet. I took my seat and discreetly sent a message to Yorka.</p>



<p><em>‘Yorka, I’m sorry. This is my fault. Apparently, someone saw us at the station on Saturday morning. People might be staring, but just ignore them like always. It’s just a passing rumor. Don’t worry. If you need anything, let me know.’</em></p>



<p>The message meant to encourage Yorka ended up sounding more like a prayer from me. I sent it and realized I forgot to add a line break.</p>



<p>I scanned the classroom. The classmates I should be familiar with suddenly seemed intimidating.</p>



<p>“Is it really Sena-kun?”</p>



<p>“Maybe a misunderstanding?”</p>



<p>“They’re not a good match, right?”</p>



<p>“Such an odd couple.”</p>



<p>“But Arisaka-san was cheering for him at the sports festival.”</p>



<p>“Could it be a coincidence?”</p>



<p>“Seriously, why would those two date?”</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san could choose anyone cool; it’s a pity.”</p>



<p>What a hassle.</p>



<p>Strangely, everyone’s chatter seemed unusually loud. For them, it was just casual conversation—no ill intent behind the words. But as the one involved, I couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p>──This must be Yorka’s daily life.</p>



<p>A life constantly under the scrutiny of others was truly suffocating. Especially for someone like Yorka, who didn’t seek attention, it was nothing short of living hell.</p>



<p>After a while, the other party involved made an appearance in the classroom. The beauty whose expressions had vanished as if the once joyful sleepover was a lie.</p>



<p>Clad in an impenetrable cloak of thorns, the displeasure of the school’s most beautiful girl ruthlessly dominated the surroundings. She didn’t even spare me a glance, acting as if indifferent, as if unrelated.</p>



<p>Then, Kanzaki-sensei took the podium, and the morning homeroom began.</p>


<p>Time passed without me finding a way to approach Yorka.</p>



<p>I couldn’t figure out how to quash the rumors about Yorka’s morning return precisely. How long should I wait for time to resolve it? I wasn’t someone with enough influence to change people’s perceptions with a single word.</p>



<p>Sena Kisumi is just an ordinary guy, lacking any notable strengths or distinctive features. I’m not the kind of person who could decisively change things in a single moment.</p>



<p>My own powerlessness was frustrating. I wished I could become a man more worthy of Yorka, someone who could protect her from these petty rumors.</p>



<p>During lunch break, Yorka swiftly left the classroom.</p>



<p>From the start, she had tried to keep this relationship hidden. I thought of heading to the art prep room, but what good would it do?</p>



<p>Apologize? Discuss? Express sadness? Offer comfort?</p>



<p>Sharing emotions wouldn’t make the rumors disappear. Regardless of the facts, Arisaka Yorka had already found herself in an unwelcome and uncomfortable situation the moment everyone’s attention was drawn to her.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun. Can I talk to you for a moment?” Asaki-san called out to me.</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Is the rumor true?”</p>



<p>“What rumor?”</p>



<p>“Don’t play dumb. The one about Arisaka-san being seen off by you at the station on Saturday morning. Are you two dating?”</p>



<p>“That’s quite a specific rumor.”</p>



<p>“A girl from the tea ceremony club mentioned it. So, spill the beans.”</p>



<p>“Spill what?… Wait, Asaki-san. When did you hear this rumor?”</p>



<p>“It was on Saturday, but we still had club activities.”</p>



<p>“──”</p>



<p>While talking to Asaki-san, Nanamura suddenly slung an arm around me.</p>



<p>“Hasekura-chan, sorry, but I’m borrowing Sena.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, let’s grab a meal together with Nanamu and I.” Miyachi also joined in.</p>



<p>“No room for refusal, okay?”</p>



<p>“Let’s go.”</p>



<p>Against my will, I was forcibly dragged away by the two.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>“So, what’s the deal with that rumor?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, what’s the deal?”</p>



<p>Nanamura and Miyachi pressed me as they made me sit at a desk in an empty classroom. It felt like an interrogation.</p>



<p>“I’ll remain silent.”</p>



<p>“It’s useless to resist at this point.”</p>



<p>Nanamura, boasting a height of 190 centimeters, stood out in a different way than Yorka. He always had a head above everyone else, making his words carry a certain weight.</p>



<p>If the rumor was true or false didn’t matter; it’s all about whether it was a topic that piqued curiosity.</p>



<p>“Yoryor stands out like a celebrity, so she’s bound to attract attention.”</p>



<p>“…Yeah.”</p>



<p>Tempted by Miyachi’s objective opinion, my reservation slipped.</p>



<p>And then, I confessed to them that I was indeed dating Yorka.</p>



<p>“So──have you done it?” Nanamura asked with a cheeky grin.</p>



<p>“It’s because of vulgar guys like you that this situation is happening!”</p>



<p>“Well, can’t help it. People love gossip about others’ sex lives.”</p>



<p>Nanamura’s ability to casually utter the word “sex” highlighted the vast difference in our popularity.</p>



<p>“We didn’t do anything! It was raining heavily on Friday, and Yorka took shelter at my place. My sister ended up liking her, and that’s how she stayed over! That’s it!”</p>



<p>“Ei-chan is cute. Yoryor might not be able to refuse if Ei-chan asks.”</p>



<p>Miyachi had met Ei once before.</p>



<p>“Huh, is Sena’s sister really cute? Introduce her next time!”</p>



<p>“If you lay a hand on my sister, I’ll kill you!”</p>



<p>I got seriously angry.</p>



<p>“…Siscon.”</p>



<p>“Cuteness is justice.”</p>



<p>Leaving that aside, I explained the situation to both of them.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi and Yoryor started dating when we became second years. The morning after they stayed over, someone saw them.”</p>



<p>“If Arisaka-chan and even mob-face Sena are known, we can narrow down the culprit who spread the rumor.”</p>



<p>“I don’t care about finding the culprit! Anyway, I just don’t want Yorka to go through a hard time.”</p>



<p>All I wished for was to bring this situation to a close.</p>



<p>“Alright. If we find them, I’ll lend a hand.”</p>



<p>Basketball team ace Nanamura slammed his fist against his open palm. I appreciated his concern, but let’s avoid violence.</p>



<p>“I get your concerns, but what does Yoryor want?”</p>



<p>“My LINE message is marked as read, but there’s no reply. And as you know, she’s giving off a ‘don’t talk to me’ vibe right now.”</p>



<p>“Then, let me talk to Yoryor.” Miyachi volunteered like it was the most natural thing.</p>



<p>“That works. No matter how close you are, meeting Arisaka-chan under the current situation would only fuel the rumors.”</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure if involving Nanamura and Miyachi in our relationship, though indirectly, was the right move.</p>



<p>As I pondered, my phone vibrated in my pocket.</p>



<p><strong><em>Yorka</em></strong>: <em>I can’t inconvenience you because of me, Sena. I’m sorry. Let’s break up.</em></p>



<p>Just when she finally started calling me by my first name, she reverted back to my last name.</p>



<p>“Sena?”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, you look pale.”</p>



<p>I paused for a moment, my head hung. With a single message, my emotions plunged into a bottomless abyss. Unable to articulate my feelings, I was engulfed in an indescribable discomfort──</p>



<p>“Stop jumping to conclusions on your own!” I shouted towards the ceiling.</p>



<p>She was rushing ahead without considering my feelings. Whatever she thought or felt, it was too extreme!</p>



<p>“Don’t just scream out of nowhere.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi can get angry too, huh?” Miyachi’s eyes widened.</p>



<p>“Look at this!”</p>



<p>Driven by emotion, I show them the screen of my phone.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan seems fragile despite appearances.”</p>



<p>“Yoryor doesn’t have friends she can talk to, so she must have felt cornered.”</p>



<p>They both arrived at the same conclusion after understanding Yorka’s true nature, which was aligning perfectly with my sentiments.</p>



<p>“So, Sumisumi, are you going to accept this?”</p>



<p>“No way! I’ll talk to her directly!”</p>



<p>If Yorka truly wished for a breakup, eventually I’d have to accept it. But this was different. Even I could see that.</p>



<p>“Nanamu, stop Sumisumi!”</p>



<p>“Got it!” Nanamura restrained me with his muscular arms from behind.</p>



<p>“Let go, Nanamura! Why are you stopping me?”</p>



<p>“Approaching YorYor emotionally like this will only backfire with her.” Miyachi looked into my eyes. “Sumisumi, do you have the determination not to give up until the end? Dating Yoryor is tough, you know.”</p>



<p>“Obviously. I knew that from the beginning when I confessed.”</p>



<p>“Then leave it to me. Oh, and don’t reply to her LINE, okay?”</p>



<p>“Are you sure? To rely on Miyachi for something like this…””We’re friends, aren’t we? Trust me, <em>Kisumi-kun</em>.” Miyachi said it with conviction</p>


<p>During lunch break, after sending a breakup message to Kisumi, I found myself unable to move.</p>



<p>I sat in the art preparation room like an empty shell.</p>



<p>I couldn’t bring myself to return to the classroom, but leaving early felt like too much trouble. Before I knew it, it was already after school.</p>



<p>There’s still no reply from Kisumi.</p>



<p>The message had been read, so he must have seen it. I had a small hope that he might come to see me here, but he hadn’t shown up.</p>



<p>Well, of course not. I unilaterally declared the breakup. It was only natural for him to be angry. A self-centered girl like me deserved to be fed up with.</p>



<p>Intellectually, I understand that I was overreacting, but my heart couldn’t bear it.</p>



<p>If things continued like this, I might end up treating Kisumi harshly. He was kind, and he’d probably handle it well, but I didn’t want to hurt someone I cared about. It was the accumulation of these concerns that made me fear being hated by Kisumi.</p>



<p>If that’s the case, rather than waiting to be hated, I decided to end the relationship myself. That’s why I impulsively sent that message.</p>



<p>“Why does everyone have to interfere…”</p>



<p>All I wanted was to spend enjoyable moments with the one I loved, so why wouldn’t they leave me alone?</p>



<p>“… I need to get my bag.”</p>



<p>At this hour, the classroom should be empty. My legs were still heavy, and it was hard to muster the will to move.</p>



<p>Then, there was a gentle knock on the door of the art prep room. I stiffened and stared at the door.</p>



<p>“YorYor~ It’s me, Hinaka~~”</p>



<p>With a cute, elongated voice, she called out to me.</p>



<p>Miyauchi Hinaka, a petite girl close to Kisumi. During the sports festival, at Kisumi’s request, she stayed by my side the whole time. Even when someone approached, she acted as a shield, and I honestly appreciated it.</p>



<p>Despite her eccentric appearance, she exuded a mysterious charm with a soft atmosphere. Compared to others, she was easy to talk to, and surprisingly, I remembered her name after just one introduction.</p>



<p>“Come in.”</p>



<p>She peeked in and, upon spotting me, smiled cheerfully, “I’m glad you’re still here.”</p>



<p>“Why does Miyauchi-san…”</p>



<p>“I wanted to have a little secret talk with you. I asked Sumisumi for your location. Sorry about that.”</p>



<p>“…I see.”</p>



<p>“Don’t look so downcast. Did you want Sumisumi to come that badly?”</p>



<p>“No!”</p>



<p>“It’s so obvious~”</p>



<p>Miyauchi-san casually took a seat beside me.</p>



<p>“──But no. I can’t let him meet a girl who would hurt him.”</p>



<p>Her tone dropped as if a different person were speaking.</p>



<p>“What do you mean…?”</p>



<p>“I know everything. You contacted him to break up unilaterally, right? Even then, why are you the one getting hurt?”</p>



<p>“It’s none of your business!” I unintentionally raised my voice.</p>



<p>“It’s natural to worry when my friend is in trouble.”</p>



<p>“…Friend? Am I your friend, Miyauchi-san?”</p>



<p>“Of course. I’m on your side. You didn’t want Sumisumi to be badmouthed because of those nasty rumors, right?”</p>



<p>Miyauchi-san hit the nail on the head.</p>



<p>It was usual for others to speak freely about me. However when it comes to Sena Kisumi, the person I loved, being spoken ill of, I couldn’t stand it.</p>



<p>Loving someone yet feeling hurt. I, being weak, couldn’t endure this contradiction for long.</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>Having my true feelings accurately pointed out was scarier than I thought. But when Miyauchi-san said it, I felt relieved in a way. Being hit close to home was, in a sense, proof that someone understood me accurately.</p>



<p>It was my first experience of that kind, and my tense heart suddenly relaxed. Tears welled up naturally.</p>



<p>“Miyauchi-san, I…”</p>



<p>“But, you know, more than anything, I’m on Sumisumi’s side.”</p>



<p>Although her voice was gentle, it was incredibly intimidating.</p>



<p>“While I understand your feelings, that’s a bit self-centered. Have you thought about how much he would be hurt by that?”</p>



<p>Despite her smiling face, clear animosity was directed at me.</p>



<p>“Do you think it’s okay to selfishly mess with him just because he confessed and he likes you? That’s naive, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Miyauchi-san squinted her eyes, lifting the corners of her lips in a malicious smile.</p>



<p>“W-Why do you say that to me?”</p>



<p>“Because I confessed to Sena Kisumi-kun, and he rejected me.”</p>



<p>“…Huh?”</p>



<p>“I confessed to him last spring break. He said he couldn’t date me because he was waiting for an answer from the person he liked.”</p>



<p>“Lies. You two never gave off any such vibes…”</p>



<p>It made no sense. There was no indication that Sena Kisumi and this girl were anything more than friends.</p>



<p>“I asked to stay friends.”</p>



<p>“And you went back to being friends?”</p>



<p>I clung to the hope that I might be able to return to last year’s state with him pathetically.</p>



<p>“Why do you think I got rejected?!”</p>



<p>Miyauchi-san’s long sleeves slapped my right cheek. For the first time in my life, I was slapped across the face, and my brain completely froze.</p>



<p>“Of course I can’t go back. Sumisumi acts normal because he’s kind.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that too painful? How can you ever be with someone you like without being together?”</p>



<p>“Says the idiot who’s trying to throw away her own happiness!”</p>



<p>I caught the sleeve flying toward my left cheek just in time.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yoryor. Did he ever tell you that being in a relationship with you is painful?”</p>



<p>“…No.”</p>



<p>“Right now, dumping Sumisumi for your own convenience is treating him the same way as those who confessed to you and got rejected. Is the boy you like such an irrelevant person to you?”</p>



<p>I shook my head.</p>



<p>I, always fearful, tended to prioritize protecting myself. But even someone like me was already being protected and supported by someone.</p>



<p>“If you like him, you have to respond to that. It’ll be okay; he will figure something out for sure.”</p>



<p>I rose to my feet.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, Miyauchi-san, but thank you.”</p>



<p>“I told you. I’m on your side and Sumisumi’s side.”</p>



<p>“Hey, could someone like me become friends with you?”</p>



<p>It surprised me that those words naturally came out of my lips. But I did want to be friends with Miyauchi Hinaka.</p>



<p>“We’re already friends, so I mean it. He is waiting for you in the classroom. Good luck.”</p>



<p>My first female friend was once my former love rival. Our positions might be opposite. However, Sena Kisumi chose me.</p>



<p>“I’m leaving.”</p>



<p>If you loved someone, you shouldn’t let them go.</p>



<p>In order to see him again, I rushed out of the art preparation room. I sprint through the dimming corridors at dusk.</p>



<p>In the distance, the wind ensemble’s performance echoed, accompanied by the sounds of the baseball team practicing on the field. Yet, the loudest sound was the pounding of my own accelerated heartbeat.</p>



<p>I almost collided with someone at the corner of the corridor.</p>



<p><em>Get out of the way! Everyone, disappear! I don’t need strangers, I don’t need names I don’t know. As long as Kisumi is here, my world is complete. That’s enough.</em></p>



<p><em>Why do I have to care about others? You’re all too nosy. Leave me alone!</em></p>



<p>I love Sena Kizumi.</p>



<p>Just being loved by the one I love makes me stronger.</p>



<p>Running through the school building in one breath, I reached the classroom of Class 2-A.</p>



<p>“Kisumi…”</p>



<p>There, waiting for me, was the person I loved. And──</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun, want to go out with me?”</p>



<p>Reaching out to him was Hasekura Asaki.</p>



<p>My step into the classroom came to an abrupt halt.</p>
