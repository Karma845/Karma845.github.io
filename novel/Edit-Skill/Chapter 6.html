<h3>Chapter 6: Love Whispers are Too Sensible</h3>


<p>I returned to the classroom with Yorka in tow. With an air of triumph, I entered the room and exclaimed, “I’ve caught the fugitive!”</p>



<p>“Hey, isn’t your voice a bit too loud!?”</p>



<p>Ignoring a flustered Yorka, the classroom erupted in cheers. Amidst the acclaim, I escorted Yorka to her seat, then casually strolled back to the front of the room.</p>



<p>“Hey, everyone! Thanks, thanks. I had quite a tough time securing the culprit.”</p>



<p>As I fielded questions akin to a post-victory interview, I turned Yorka’s escape into a humorous anecdote, successfully navigating the situation.</p>



<p>In the end, Yorka, with almost no experience in ball games, was selected for the individual competition in table tennis.</p>



<p>Her reason for choosing table tennis? She simply stated, “I dislike the sunlight.”</p>



<p>With all members of Class 2-A now assigned to their respective events, when the closing chime of the day rang, Yorka swiftly left the classroom like a rabbit.</p>



<p>Despite a brief warning from Kanzaki-sensei, there was no severe reprimand for Yorka. The current atmosphere in the classroom, where everyone was excitedly discussing her spontaneous actions, likely served as a perfect lesson for Yorka, who preferred to avoid attention.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Kisumi-kun! You really saved the day.” Asaki-san expressed her gratitude for today’s incident. “I never thought Arisaka-san would get so worked up. Do you know the reason, Kisumi-kun?”</p>



<p>The reason was indeed the way you addressed me. Bingo.</p>



<p>I couldn’t outright say that if she didn’t want to anger Yorka, she shouldn’t call me by my first name. Publicly, Yorka and I were just classmates. The recent chase didn’t leave an impression beyond the class rep scoring a major victory.</p>



<p>“Well, she was probably just in a bad mood.”</p>



<p>“Really, I’m glad Kisumi-kun is my partner. I’ll be counting on you from now on.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to take on more work, so I’ll have to return that expectation.”</p>



<p>Sure, being relied upon by someone as friendly and approachable as Asaki-san felt good. However, I needed to avoid reducing my time with Yorka.</p>



<p>“…Consider it a mere compliment. Accept it sincerely. No refunds.”</p>



<p>“Fine, I’ll only accept the words then.”</p>



<p>While having a chat with Asaki-san, Nanamura, the basketball team member, joined in.</p>



<p>“Sena, are you getting cozy with Hasekura-chan this time?”</p>



<p>“What do you mean ‘this time’?”</p>



<p>“Well, it took you quite a while to bring back Arisaka-chan, so I figured you two might have been getting cozy.”</p>



<p>“Your unnecessary comments drove Arisaka away!”</p>



<p>I punched Nanamura’s stomach. His well-trained abs were tough, and my knuckles ended up hurting more.</p>



<p>“SumiSumi, you’re quite the ladies’ man.” Miyachi chimed in, patting me with the extra-long sleeves of her uniform.</p>



<p>“Don’t tease me. Hey, Miyachi, can I ask you for a favor?”</p>



<p>“Me? A favor?”</p>



<p>“On the day of the sports festival, can you stay with Arisaka? I’d appreciate it.”</p>



<p>“Is that a class rep request or a personal request from you?” Miyachi tilted her head, peering into my face.</p>



<p>“Both.”</p>



<p>“Got it.” She agreed with a bright smile.</p>



<p>“You’re a challenger, Miyauchi,” Nanamura commented, indifferent to the situation.</p>



<p>“Even though you like girls, Nanamura, you hate taking care of them.”</p>



<p>“I welcome all who come and don’t chase away those who leave,” Nanamura stated shamelessly.</p>



<p>“Honest to a fault.”</p>



<p>“The worst.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san and I exchanged bemused glances at the arrogance of the basketball team’s ace. In the face of our disapproving glares, Nanamura, with robust mental resilience, just laughed it off.</p>

<p>“What was that about? Showing off your captured prey like a hunter, were you?”</p>



<p>When I stepped into the art preparation room, Yorka was there, clearly upset.</p>



<p>“If you mean capturing the impregnable fortress that is Arisaka Yorka’s heart, then yes, I suppose I’m a hunter.”</p>



<p>“Stop boasting; it’s annoying.”</p>



<p>I dropped my bag and took a seat on the nearest chair.</p>



<p>“Look at it the other way, Yorka. I made the situation fun.”</p>



<p>“I hate fooling around.”</p>



<p>“Well, think about it. Your escapade of leaving during class—had I not injected a bit of humor into it, you might have gotten a serious scolding from Kanzaki-sensei.”</p>



<p>At my critical words, Yorka smirked.</p>



<p>“Heh, siding with the authorities even though you’re my boyfriend. Traitor.”</p>



<p>“Reluctantly, I am also the class rep. Still, I’m bending the rules quite a bit for my beloved girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“…Again, throwing around the ‘beloved’ casually.”</p>



<p>“Then should I show it through actions instead of words?”</p>



<p>“Don’t get cocky. You did that just a while ago. Show some restraint.”</p>



<p>Her words sounded tough, but she blushed, revealing her embarrassment. Cute.</p>



<p>“How about a date to lighten the mood?”</p>



<p>Playing table tennis at the recreational facility while enjoying ourselves might be a good idea. Oh, but it could be crowded, making it tough for Yorka. She’d stand out in a crowd and that might tire her out.</p>



<p>“…Today is a no-go. I’m not feeling up to it.”</p>



<p>“You’re the type to get down easily, huh?”</p>



<p>Yorka seemed more reserved than I had expected.</p>



<p>“When something bothers me, I tend to dwell on it. That’s why I try to avoid socializing, keep my distance, and push people away.”</p>



<p>“Thus, the aloof beauty and honor student were born.”</p>



<p>“If only communication could be done through telepathy.”</p>



<p>“For someone bad with words, why do you think telepathy would work? Plus, you’d be hearing everything in the head.”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t mess up like that.”</p>



<p>“No, I meant my head. You’d easily pick up on me whispering sweet nothings to you all day.”</p>



<p>“──!!” Yorka reflexively covered her ears.</p>



<p>“Hmm? What’s up?”</p>



<p>“Don’t say stupid things! Th-that’s absolutely not allowed.”</p>



<p>“It’ll be fine. Others won’t hear, so our secret is safe.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be the one troubled! …If you do that, I won’t be able to function. I’m sure I won’t be able to focus on anything.”</p>



<p>Yorka blushed, avoiding eye contact. Just imagining it made her react sensitively; Yorka seemed bad at hiding things. Her honest side like this was endearing.</p>



<p>“I’ll make some tea. Do you want some, Sena?” Yorka rose casually.</p>



<p>“Sure. Brew it with lots of love, please.”</p>



<p>“Even if it’s just tea leaves, drink it!”</p>



<p>“Just having you make it makes it delicious; no problem.”</p>



<p>The tea Yorka prepared had a delightful aroma. Apparently, it was a premium foreign brand she brought with her. A peaceful after-school moment with delicious tea, madeleine, and cookies – just the two of us.</p>



<p>After a leisurely snack time, at her request, we decided to play a game for a change of pace – Mario Kart. We kept the volume low.</p>



<p>“Soon, you’ll learn that I’m better than you.” Yorka declared victory even before we started playing, holding the controller confidently.</p>



<p>“I won’t lose without putting up a fight,” I said with a daring grin.</p>



<p>“The loser gets a penalty. How about the winner gets to give one order?”</p>



<p>“It’d be embarrassing if the one who brought it up ends up losing.”</p>



<p>“I, the victorious one, will give the order. That’s it.”</p>



<p>Sparks flew as we clashed. However, since the TV was small, we ended up playing with our shoulders close.</p>



<p>“…You’re a bit too close. Move away.”</p>



<p>“If I’m far away, I won’t be able to see the screen. Don’t resort to unfair tactics before we start.”</p>



<p>“Huh? If anything, you could give me a handicap and I’d still win easily.”</p>



<p>After we selected characters, the race began. Our skills were evenly matched. We engaged in a fierce back-and-forth, overtaking each other relentlessly.</p>



<p>“You’re persistent!”</p>



<p>“You’re just as competitive!”</p>



<p>Yorka won one race, and then I won the next. As we continued, our shoulders collided. Initially, I thought it was a coincidence, but it kept happening.</p>



<p>Yorka was the type whose body moved along with the game. She must be oblivious as she remained engrossed in the game.</p>



<p>“Yorka, your body moves while you play. It’s distracting.”</p>



<p>“Huh? No way.”</p>



<p>“You’re doing it unconsciously. Just stay still.”</p>



<p>“Are you making excuses? Are you that scared of losing?” Yorka smirked provocatively.</p>



<p>“So, touching is not considered interference, right?”</p>



<p>Mid-race, I stood up and circled behind Yorka. Then, slipping my arms around her from both sides, I readjusted the controller around her belly button. This way, I made sure her movements wouldn’t interfere, and I still had a clear view of the screen.</p>



<p>In essence, I was playing the game while embracing her from behind.</p>



<p>“Huh? W-w-wait, wha──what the hell!?”</p>



<p>“You’ll go off-course if you don’t look ahead.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Oh, come on!”</p>



<p>“You said physical contact isn’t interference, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>I easily secured victory in that race.</p>



<p>“This is totally unfair!”</p>



<p>“Where?” I shrugged off Yorka’s complaints and moved on to the next race.</p>



<p>“That’s cheating! I can’t focus like this!”</p>



<p>“If you have a problem, why not change your own position?”</p>



<p>“Ugh… I won’t lose!”</p>



<p>Yorka shrunk back, doing her best to concentrate on the race without touching me.</p>



<p>“Chasing after my rear so fervently, that’s some intense affection you’ve got there.”</p>



<p>“Don’t say weird things!”</p>



<p>More angry than embarrassed, Yorka, with her considerable skill honed in the art prep room, fiercely pursued me. Uh-oh. She’s definitely put in the effort to improve her skills.</p>



<p>“You’re getting stronger when angry – are you the protagonist of some shonen manga?”</p>



<p>“Sena, don’t think you’ll be forgiven. I’ll definitely win!”</p>



<p>With precise course navigation and skillful use of items, she clung closely behind me. At this rate, Yorka might overtake me.</p>



<p>“Yorka.”</p>



<p>“Be quiet!”</p>



<p>Our victory count was currently tied.</p>



<p>“Let’s settle this. The winner of this race takes it all.”</p>



<p>“I’m in!”</p>



<p>The game entered the final lap. Would I defend my first-place position, or would Yorka use a powerful item to attack and overtake me?</p>



<p>I didn’t want to resort to this, but there’s no other choice.</p>



<p>“Yorka,” Carefully, I leaned close to her ear and whispered, “I love you.”</p>



<p>Yorka jerked back, startled, and in the motion, she dropped the controller. Taking advantage of the distraction, I crossed the finish line in one go.</p>



<p>“Alright! I won!”</p>



<p>“Sena, cut it out! What you just did doesn’t count!” Yorka turned around abruptly and lodged her protest.</p>



<p>“Don’t get so angry. I was just expressing this overflowing love.”</p>



<p>“Liar!”</p>



<p>“There’s no way my feelings for you is a lie.”</p>



<p>“Don’t twist my words!”</p>



<p>“At least call it a psychological attack.”</p>



<p>“Look, you admitted it was an attack! Got you on record!”</p>



<p>Yorka was seething in my arms. Our faces were so close that we could see each other’s reflections in our eyes, even closer than when we held hands on the stairs earlier.</p>



<p>“Uh… well…”</p>



<p>It seemed she finally realized, but given her anger, she couldn’t exactly pull away. Her gaze was all over the place, unsure of how to react.</p>



<p>“Yorka, I’ve decided on the penalty.”</p>



<p>“W-What…”</p>



<p>“Can I kiss you right now?”</p>



<p>“──!!”</p>



<p>Yorka immediately tried to pull away, but instinctively, I grabbed her slender arm.</p>



<p>“Wait!”</p>



<p>“Don’t ask for permission. There’s a thing called timing and atmosphere!”</p>



<p>Yorka shook off my hand and retreated to the corner of the room.</p>



<p>“…Besides, I don’t want my precious first kiss to be some kind of penalty.” Yorka murmured while covering her lips with both hands.</p>



<p>“That’s true. My bad, I got carried away. I’m sorry.” I finally regained my composure. I got too impatient and only prioritized my own feelings.</p>



<p>“I’m happy you express your feelings so openly. But I don’t like the way you cheapened it.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be more careful from now on.”</p>



<p>“And no more messing with my ears; they’re sensitive!”</p>



<p>Yorka was scolding me, but she practically confessed her own weak point.</p>
