<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Triple Structure &#8211; First Joint Work of Three People</h3>

<p>About the destruction of the “Common Guild”, about Aine-san’s memories being stolen, and about Leticia-san, the childhood friend of Aine-san who wished to cooperate with us and help her friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An item which pulls out memories… I think I’ve heard of something like that before”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita tilted her head after hearing the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I’m not wrong, it’s supposed to be called a Purifying cane. It’s used on believers and others who wish to serve the goddess. It erases their past, turning them into brand new people. The pulled out memories have the form of a crystal and completely dissolve into air after about three days”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder if what’s hidden in the tower isn’t actually a counterfeit”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It might’ve been if Argis was working alone. However, if this count went as far as swearing “on his honor”, then the likelihood of it being genuine isn’t that low. He even deployed “Steel Gargoyle” there after all”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; good grief, even a bad thing can turn out good”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guess we have to get even with him”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita was angry… and considerably so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If things didn’t go well, she might’ve been turned into a slave herself by the deputy bishop Argis and had her memories erased by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes! I approve of this time’s strategy as well!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl energetically threw her hands in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the first place, the one who had summoned the cursed sword was from my family. If Nagi-sama expresses his desire to help those who ended up being unhappy because of this, I will work with all my power!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them seemed quite motivated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, there were four skill crystals lined up before me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Drain Cleaning LV1” that I received from Aine-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Song of magic amplification LV1” and “Slow LV1” that I got from Leticia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steal LV1” that I bought on the way from the guild.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since our opponent this time was made of metal, I made sure to buy a spare shortsword, just to be on the safe side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, I’ve always wondered how, by combining such things, one would go about defeating a Steel Gargoyle”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of the current quest was to retrieve Aine-san’s memories. Once that’s done, we would head to Irgafar together with Aine-san and Leticia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our opponents are some lowlifes and Steel Gargoyles”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lowlives weren’t that strong. At the very least they would be weaker than Tanaka Koga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the “Steel Gargoyle” which’s a problem. The specs were as follows:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Steel Gargoyle: a carved statue which moves with magical power. It possesses wings and claws. Flame magic is ineffective against it, and physical damage is reduced. However, amongst all types of gargoyles, it’s considered low-level</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cecyl, Rita, listen to me”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down on the bed, folded my arms and looked at the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is something that I’ve noticed just the other day when I was experimenting with Rita on “Reconstruction Ability ‘Skill Structure’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; Wau?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“C’mon, don’t get flustered. I won’t use it as a punishment anymore!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Woof”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please stop trembling and clutching your chest. And don’t act like a puppy only at times like these.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Invoke — Ability Reconstruction”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the skill activated, a window surfaced. It’s the same as before. I imagined the skill inside of me, and its general concept was disassembled before me. However, once I took a closer look… it turned out the window had become slightly larger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What this meant was that I apparently could fit one more skill into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cecyl, Rita, why don’t you help me out just a bit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl said with a puzzled face.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, that’s right. The two of them could not see the window.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Look, I want to ascertain whether I can make us more powerful so that we can clear this quest. If manage to do it, it means we will be able to borrow a residence where we can settle down, cook for ourselves, and even take baths”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;baths, you say?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl was pondering about it for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll be able to take our time in the bath, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yep, as much time as we would like”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of us together, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yep, with Cecyl and others”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; I understand!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Cecyl quickly moved to me while still on her knees and presented her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yes, do as you wish, Nagi-sama”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, not fair!”</span></p>
<p><b><i>*Fluffy, pitter-patter* </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With moves like that of a kitten, Rita dashed to me as well. Both of them closed their eyes, having prepared themselves or so it would seem. I got down from the bed and stood on my knees in front of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… as I thought, I was nervous. My hands… don’t you dare tremble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a deep breath. Ever so softly, my right hand was then placed on Cecyl’s chest. “&#8230;Mnn” — to which Cecyl twitched a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I summoned the window of Cecyl’s skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Animal Empathy LV1” was displayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to it was my skill. As an experiment, I’d installed “Steal LV1” into myself.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steal LV1” — a skill “To snatch” a “Weapon” by using a “Technique”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Animal Empathy LV1” — a skill “To communicate” one’s “feelings” with “animals”</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;. Ah, mn… Haaa&#8230; Nagi…sama”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you alright, Cecyl?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am fine, yes”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Okay… next is Rita”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;.. Eh? Eh? Eeeeeeh?! Me too?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was still some space in the window of “Ability Reconstruction LV2”. Although she was surprised, Rita had to understand that this skill was our lifeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Ya. Hey~. Nagi-i… wait a…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I touched Rita’s chest with my right hand. She twitched a bit like she was ticklish. However, she didn’t distance herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry. Please hold on for a bit more”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; don’t apologize, you fool”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I summoned the window of one of Rita’s skills, “Singing LV4”. I hope I can do it&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(3) “Singing LV4” — skill “to rouse” a “human heart” with “song”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… I managed to do it. I’d finally understood the effects of “Ability Reconstruction LV2”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus far I was only able to “reconstruct” the abilities of only two people at the same time, now I could do it with three people. By combining the magical powers of myself and my slaves, I could potentially create even more advanced skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The magical power of two people could produce an ultra-rare skill. In that case, I wondered what I could do with the combined magical power of three people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yep. The experiment is done”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I removed my hands from the two’s chests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hiya”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Ha &#8230;Fu… uh huh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Cecyl and Rita breathed out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It became clear how to use a LV2 skill. However, there seemed to be various questions associated with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I waited for the two to calm themselves and started to explain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first problem lied with the burden on the girls’ bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed quite painful for them to exchange their magical power with me when we did it one-on-one. Therefore, I didn’t know what could happen if we circulated the magical power of three people at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second problem was of physical nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to have a touch contact with the girls when I was using “Reconstruction”. Skills were located in a person’s chest, so being touched close to the heart was the easiest method to exchange magical power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I touched them with my hands, but it was impossible to alter the “concept” in the “ability reconstruction” skill while touching both Cecyl and Rita. I only had two hands, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It came down to that we would have to bring our hearts as close as possible to each other and link the magical powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last problem was that I would like to do all of that in a safe place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the “Reconstruction” all of us were basically defenseless. I didn’t believe the “Noble Guild” would raid us, but I wanted to be careful on the off-chance that they would try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; and that’s how it is”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Such a worrywart”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita giggled through her nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that essential? Let’s forgo all of it then. The burden on the body and whatnot, bring it all on”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“About the second problem. In other words, we are all good if Nagi-sama can circulate magical power while his hands are occupied, right?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep. Well, that’s how it is.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason Cecyl’s cheeks became red and she clenched her hands into fists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My specialty lies with using magical power, and I have an idea which I would like to discuss with Rita in advance. The last problem is to find a safe place”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There should be one, the place which only we know about and that can’t be entered by anyone but us”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">… Ah, I somehow got it. That place might certainly do the trick. We will be able to experiment with the “Reconstructed” skills, and not worry about other people coming. Time-wise… We should be able to reach there by evening if we went immediately.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I most certainly hate having to work overtime though”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t unpaid overtime, so who cares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I regarded Leticia as honest, so she would pay the fee properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Got it. Let’s make preparations, I want to arrive there before evening. We’re moving out immediately”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes!” “Roger!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, we decided to set out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">——————————-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time required to finally reach the hidden room in the basement of the magician’s residence was a little bit over two hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here daytime and nighttime were the same —  the walls were illuminated by almost white light. The entrance was sealed with “Ancient language” so we didn’t have to worry about people other people entering here. As for the “Angel Guardian”, it wouldn’t do anything as long we didn’t enter the room it was protecting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that I think of it, the safe place that you talked about was this one”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thank you, the honorable ancestor of Cecyl.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trees were growing here and there in the room, and the floor was covered by a flowing river with almost waist-high depth — it was perhaps flowing into the nearby hot spring —  this might’ve been the reason why the temperature here was pleasantly warm, like during springtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This place clears the problem of safety”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the burden placed on the girls’ bodies, both Cecyl and Rita said “Bring it on”, so I decided to believe them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only remaining issue was how to circulate the magical power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You said that you two have an idea about that, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Cecyl was nodding bashfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You and Rita talked it out between yourselves”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. It’s perfect now”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is. Nagi-sama, could please sit down over here for a bit?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All together, Cecyl and Rita pointed at the bank of the spring flowing in the center of the room. That place was like a riverbank in the Nakasu district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ehhm, so I should just sit down here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking off my shoes, I sat down on the bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow it felt like I entered a footbath in my former world, even though I never was at a hot spring at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A little bit forward, Nagi-sama”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And, we apologize in advance. Please forgive us, master”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">—— Eh?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita plopped on my back. Losing balance, I slid down into the warm river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for my lack of resistance was that my field of vision went totally dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without even voicing out her intentions, Rita then put a blindfold made of some cloth on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, Umm. This is a bit. What’s this, Cecyl, Rita?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so that you wouldn’t catch a cold, Nagi-sama”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s better to have a lot of physical contact if one wants to raise the efficiency of the transfer of magical power, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, I still feel a little bit&#8230; uhm&#8230; embarrassed”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it looks like you cannot use the “Reconstruction” skill without vision, then we will remove the blindfold for you”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s possible that Nagi-sama can use it, so please give it a try”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; We will have to fight a formidable enemy after this, so… Nagi…using force is no good”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;What are you two even talking about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the sound of rustling clothes. From behind, Cecyl’s small hands started unbuttoning my coat. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s going on? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">My upper body became naked, which I could tell by intuition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait a minute! What are the two of you do&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heiya” “Nto”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soft — </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something warm pressed against me from the front and behind. The sound of pounding hearts was being transmitted to me directly through the skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The touch on my back was modest yet soft nonetheless. Slender arms were tightly holding onto me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The touch on my chest was voluptuous and heated. The sound of splashing water was probably caused by the shaking tail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words… Both Rita and Cecyl caught me… in a tight hug?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those two, they were embracing me in a way where their pressed bare chests were almost grinding against me…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ehmm… Uhm”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No words were leaving my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure I was trying to say something.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/DQWVj9Q/87929.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure we were supposed to do something in this place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I believe Nagi-sama will be able to connect our magical powers like this”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl called out to me from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… “Connect magical powers”?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Skills are located inside the chest. Therefore, the strongest flow of magical power goes near the heart”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-which is why we pressed our bodies like this so that… Umm”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even without using your hands, Nagi-sama should be able to link our magical powers, I am sure of it”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-I see.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The theory is sound, but using “Reconstruction” under such circumstances is&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By reflex, I invoked “Ability Reconstruction LV2”&#8230; and the window appeared in my pitch black vision.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, so I can see it. This is something.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s originally something that only I could see, so having no vision didn’t even matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you cannot use “Reconstruction” in this state, we will remove the b-blindfold. I-I am fine with it. Even if my body gets seen, I believe Nagi-sama won’t feel anything. However, Rita-san is&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I am cool with it as well! Getting seen doesn’t mean a thing! C’mon, bring it on!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered, how do the two of them look like right now. No, I got it. I could feel it directly in various places.  The sound of rustling clothes from earlier was them taking their clothes off. Should the blindfold be removed, I would probably be able to see something amazing… I certainly would.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; It’s fine as we are right now”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we had an important matter to address tomorrow. Things would go awfully if my reason got whittled even more, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am doing it. “Ability Reconstruction”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had little interest in the dispute between “Common Guild” and “Noble Guild”. But if it’s about saving a girl and receiving the right to live in a house, the whole deal didn’t sound as bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ability Reconstruction — Skill Structure”, Invoke!”</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steal LV1” — a skill “To Snatch” a “Weapon” by using a “Technique”</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I summoned a skill from within myself. This “Steal” skill allowed to dispossess an opponent of their weapon with a fixed probability of success.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right, I am calm.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew how to connect my magical power with Cecyl’s and Rita’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two didn’t say a thing for a while. However, their breathing transmitted directly to my ears. So hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called the skill that I installed in Cecyl just a little while ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2) “Slow LV1” — a skill “to delay” the “reaction speed” by means of “magic”</span></p>
<p><b><i>*Throb*</i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cecyl’s heart rate spiked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaan! Ah… Ahh… Kuu… Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She put more power into the arms that were holding me close. Cecyl continued to tremble all the while. She’s probably being affected by the cumulative power of three people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next skill was Rita’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(3) “Magical Singing LV1” — a skill “to raise” the “Magical Power” by means of a “Song”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This skill was a common one as well. It allowed to amplify the magical power of magicians by singing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A skill like that was ideal for Rita, and and it had good usability. However, it wouldn’t be a decisive factor against “Steel Gargoyle”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;Wha~, what’s this? O-only this much, it wasn’t anything special, am I right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita quietly murmured with her chin on my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought it was something&#8230; amazing… If it’s this much, you can… do as much as…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I only displayed your skill thus far”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Woof?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Rita’s body shook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah… Auu. Rita-san, please don’t move around. If the connection gets desynchronized&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I… I’m sorry. Still…. Ehm…. Um…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you reconnect the flows&#8230; Umm… it tingles… so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Hau. Yeah. I am sorry&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bit by bit, Rita started breathing roughly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was waiting for her to calm down, I extended my hand towards the letters on the skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Touching the letters for “magical power” with zero vision——</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mnn———-!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hot breathing, and a feeling of pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s play-biting?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mn! M-m-m, Ah, ah, ah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita bit my shoulder lightly. I felt her warm tongue on my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mnn. I-I am alright. So… Nagi-i, please continue”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yeah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaking the letters for “magical power”, I started extracting Rita’s skill. Slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; Haa-a”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you start moving it a bit, it goes smoothly, so I should quickly—</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; Waa! No… this, this is different from… Ahh!” — Rita shook her head like a spoiled child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her golden hair hit my face, and… Ah…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blindfold came off. The first thing that entered my field of vision was the eyes of Rita darting vacantly around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Did she not notice that the blindfold came off?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, now wasn’t the time for that. Both for Rita, and for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next thing I saw was her back, flushed in deep red. The robe that exposed her up to her shoulder blades was swaying in the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Nagi-i… Stop… This… magic power… is much stronger than… the last time… Hurry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-yeah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t the time to get fascinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing my eyes and then opening them ever so slightly, I made the extracted letters touch a different skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next was Cecyl’s “Slow” skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Fuwa-a. Somehow… I feel… light”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind my back, I heard the girl’s feverish voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will be rewriting two concepts on Cecyl’s skill… you okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. I… b-be… long to… Nagi… shyama&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><b><i>*Throb* </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a small head pressed against my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;. Both in body……. and soul&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;. okay”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Cecyl didn’t have as much physical strength we did, given how small she was. And besides, she’s surely exhausted after using her magical power during today’s battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d better finish it as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here I come, Cecyl”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Fuya…… Nagi-shyama… come&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved two concepts of the skill at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started pushing “Magical power” extracted from Rita’s “Magical Singing”, and “To snatch” that I’d extracted from “Steal” into Cecyl’s “Slow” skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;. Ah…. Mn…. Ah…………….Aa-a-a-h, Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The small body on my back was trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of splashing water could be heard, overflowing and spreading around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ya-a… Ya… Ah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl’s slender fingers were scratching my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nagi-sama… and Rita-san… the magical power…. enters…. Ah, Ah-h-h!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was yet to enter the new concept into Cecyl completely.  The two concepts got caught at the entrance, unable to push out the concepts of “Slow”.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that because I am doing them one at the time? The letters were slanted.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I applied some pressure on the stuck parts with my fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;. Ah….. Ah!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alright, they moved.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time I add a bit more force, and—</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;.. Hyaun! Hya…. fuwa…. hi-i-i…. Mn”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ability Reconstruction LV2” allowed me to alter skills of three people, but I was unaccustomed with it yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to move the skills, I was clumsy. If it continued like this, I would only be putting more burden on Cecyl and Rita.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nagi…. sama…. Nagi…. shyama!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just a little bit more. Endure it, Cecyl”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;. I don’t… know. Nagi-shyama and… Rita-hyan… inside of me… where do I end… and Nagi-shyama begin… I don’t know already… Ah, Ahhhhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It entered. I managed to rewrite one damned concept in the “Slow” skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more to go!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl strongly forced her slender body against me.</span></p>
<p><b><i>*Haaa, Haaa* </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">her hot breath had been tickling me for a while now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not good… It’s strange…. I’m…. it’s hot… and scary… yet… I am one with… Nahi-i… Nagi-shyama… Nagi-shyama…….. Ah! Aaah!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will be done in a bit”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Nagi-shyama…. Love…. Lyuve…. Ah, Ahhh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thrust the second concept inside Cecyl.</span></p>
<p><b><i>*Throb, Throb, Throb* </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was feeling her heartbeat being transmitted to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sounds of flowing water resounded in our surrounding without stopping, waves hitting the walls and then retreating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew that the magic power was circulating inside us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl ground and nuzzled her head against my shoulder. She inhaled and her body rised a little, she exhaled and her body went listless. And then she inhaled again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was fully aware of how my and Rita’s magical power was bouncing and tingling inside Cecyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mn! Mn-aa. Mnnnnnn!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for Rita, she was nipping on my shoulder while she was enduring the magical power bustling inside her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if it’s because of the master-servant “Contract”, but Rita couldn’t injure me. That’s why, she playfully bit me and then let me go, repeating the nipping again and again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her saliva, overflowing from her still opened mouth, was running down between us. Which again added to the sound of water around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process went for so long that I started to wonder whether it would ever end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The breathing of the three people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their fever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their magical power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moist sounds, produced by the warm flowing current.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flowing in, hitting the walls, falling back, flowing out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaa…. Haaa… Ah, Aahn! Nagi…. Shyama…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mnn! Nagi… Master… Ma… This is… incredible… and scary… Ahh”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hold on, you two”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything will be over in just a bit.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pushed the letters I had extracted from Rita and Cecyl into my own skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Execute! Ability Reconstruction — Skill Structure!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An electric shock went through my back. The torrent of magical power was so strong that I realised that I should’ve been protected by “Ability Reconstruction”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wave then started flowing into the two all at once&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;. Nagi-shyama! Aa-a-a-a-h, N-n, a-a-a-a-a&#8211;a-ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl clutched onto me with all her power. The temperature of her being was being transmitted to me. We were glued to our utmost limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized it all, the figure of Cecyl on my back, the form of her chest, everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mnn-n-n, Ah-h, mn&#8211;n-n! Mn-n-n-n!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Rita’s body was arched like a bow. Her bright red and hot body was shaking. The water was flowing, in and out, around where our stomachs were. Again and again. Her golden tail was flapping so much that I was worried if it would fall off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still embracing me, Rita and Cecyl were stiff for a little while until&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;. Hiya….. Nagi-shyama…. Ah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;.. Wa…. Woof…. Ah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strength left them and they leaned on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230; thank you for your hard work”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uhm&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to free my arms, so I should start with putting the blindfold on my eyes. You see, the two of them used all their strength and couldn’t move anymore. Something terrible would surely happen if, in addition to the already overly strong stimuli of their voices, body temperatures, their sweat and smell, their figures would enter my field of vision. I would probably see something exceedingly beautiful, but we had a work to do tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">………………….. In any case, Cecyl’s and Rita’s skills were completely rewritten, as well as mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Steal LV1” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Slow LV1”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Magical Singing LV1”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those three skills were combined and produced the following, altered skills—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Delay Arts LV1”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Force Arrow LV1”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unrivalled Singing LV1”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for their effects… I should affirm them with the two once they calm down. We also should test them out. I wonder if we manage to prevail over “Angel Guardian” in the next room, a “Steel Gargoyle” of a superior level?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in order to acquire a base where we could relax in between our adventures.</span></p>
