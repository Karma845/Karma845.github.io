<h3>Chapter 8: Reward</h3>

<p>What did Yorka just say?</p>



<p>It wasn’t my exhausted mind playing tricks. The proof laid in the fact that the students, who must have heard Yorka’s voice, were all wearing stunned expressions.</p>



<p>Arisaka Yorka, who boldly raised her voice, was attracting all attention. Standing tall on the stage, cast down her gaze at me.</p>



<p>“WIN THIS, KISUMI────────────────!!”</p>



<p>Am I dreaming?</p>



<p>Yorka, of all people, shouted loudly in public. Moreover, she finally called me by my first name. Just that fact alone erased all my fatigue.</p>



<p>People around were mostly clueless, not quite grasping the situation.</p>



<p>“That was Arisaka Yorka just now?”</p>



<p>“She’s really beautiful, isn’t she?”</p>



<p>“Did she really shout like that? It’s surprising.”</p>



<p>“Who’s Kisumi?”</p>



<p>Yorka, who could dominate a scene with just one voice, was undoubtedly in a league of her own. She encouraged me to win.</p>



<p>──In this world, the most uplifting words might be the cheers of a woman you’re in love with.</p>



<p>I ran my hand through my sweat-drenched hair and took a deep breath. Even the referee was frozen stiff.</p>



<p>“Now, winning is the only option left.” Nanamura picked up the ball while grinning.</p>



<p>“I know.”</p>



<p>“Sena, your face is all red.”</p>



<p>“With this much running, my blood circulation must’ve improved.”</p>



<p>I took the ball from Nanamura. The other three were already heading towards the front court.</p>



<p>“No time to waste. This is the last play! I’ll pass. Nanamura, dribble fast and cut in. If you can’t make the shot, pass it back to me. I’ll make sure to score.”</p>



<p>“Roger that, partner.”</p>



<p>I stood at the end line, passing the ball to Nanamura. The clock began its countdown.</p>



<p>Nanamura charged toward the goal with a powerful dribble. The opposing team’s defense, three players strong, desperately tried to contain him—blocking his path, closing off escape routes, filling every gap. For them, it was merely about delaying time.</p>



<p>I sprinted onto the court.</p>



<p>“Don’t let him shoot a three-pointer.”</p>



<p>The defense obstructed the passing lane between Nanamura and me.</p>



<p>“So what?”</p>



<p>I swayed left and right, deftly shaking off the defense. When I freed myself, Nanamura, surrounded by three defenders, perfectly timed the pass.</p>



<p>The sharp pass landed perfectly in my hands. I stood at the three-point line and assumed a shooting stance.</p>



<p>Ten seconds left.</p>



<p>The last defender leaped to block the shot.</p>



<p>“Do you think I’m only going for a three-pointer?”</p>



<p>With a shot fake, I dribbled past the defender. Another defender rushed to cover from the side.</p>



<p>“────!”</p>



<p>I executed a quick crossover dribble, I deceived the opponent, causing them to lose balance and fall. With a swift move, I bypassed them and executed a jump shot.</p>



<p>In mid-air, my body slightly shifted sideways. Still, I trusted my sharpened senses. With delicate fingertip control, I adjusted.</p>



<p>At the highest point of impact, I turned my wrist and released the ball into the air.</p>



<p>The whistle announcing the end of the game blew.</p>



<p>The ball, drawing a beautiful arc, silently sank into the net.</p>



<p>A moment of hushed silence.</p>



<p>Two points added to the score, making it 15 to 14.</p>



<p>It was a comeback victory for Class 2-A.</p>



<p>However, upon landing, an unpleasant pain shot through my ankle. I collapsed onto the court.</p>



<p>I crouched down on the spot, unable to wallow in the joy of victory. The cheers sounded so far away.</p>



<p>“Ouch. Damn, had to end it looking uncool.”</p>



<p>I had made the game-winning shot, but it seemed I twisted my ankle. Wearing indoor shoes instead of basketball shoes wasn’t the brightest idea after all. The fortune-telling turned out to be surprisingly accurate.</p>



<p>While everyone exchanged high-fives and embraced in celebration, no one noticed my predicament. Amidst the revelry, a lone girl dashed towards me.</p>



<p>My girlfriend kneeled in front of me and peered into my face, looking alarmed.</p>



<p>“Sena, are you okay? Does it hurt? Let’s go to the infirmary!”</p>



<p>“…Yorka.”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? Does it hurt?”</p>



<p>“You’re surprisingly fast on your feet, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>For a moment, I forgot my pain, genuinely impressed. Jumping down from the stage, she ran straight towards me, displaying quite a decent stride.</p>



<p>“That doesn’t matter right now! Idiot!”</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t hit the injured person. I’m the hero of our victory, you should praise me more.”</p>



<p>“Trading victory for an injury is not praise-worthy,” Yorka sighed in exasperation.</p>



<p>“Since the girl I like cheered for me, how can I not give it my all?”</p>



<p>“────!!”</p>



<p>The awkward yet strangely pleasant atmosphere was unsettling, but I didn’t find it unwelcome.</p>



<p>“Hey, Sena. Should I lend a hand if you’re going to flirt?”</p>



<p>Approaching with a grin, Nanamura was clearly enjoying the situation for reasons other than the victory.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan, you were pretty fast too, huh?”</p>



<p>“Can’t I feel concerned for the injured?”</p>



<p>Perhaps intimidated by Yorka’s seriousness or startled, Nanamura reined in his grin.</p>



<p>“I thought it’s just Sena’s one-sided crush, but… well, can you stand?”</p>



<p>With Nanamura’s help, I managed to stand up. I cautiously tested my twisted left ankle on the floor, but it still hurt.</p>



<p>“Yeah, no good. Definitely a nasty sprain.”</p>



<p>“Is it serious?”</p>



<p>“I’ll be fine, Arisaka. Sprains are common in basketball; I’m used to it.” I grinned through the pain, trying not to worry Yorka.</p>



<p>“Don’t push yourself. It’s different from last year…” Yorka didn’t scold; she spoke softly, almost apologetically.</p>



<p>“It’s because Sena is a bit weak.”</p>



<p>“Don’t compare me to a physical monster like you.”</p>



<p>“Physicality is a talent too.”</p>



<p>“I’m playing basketball carrying the weight of my youth. You better contribute more.”</p>



<p>“That’s why I made plays that benefit the team. I’m glad to play basketball with you again.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, well done! Nice shot! This practically secures the overall victory.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, is the sprain severe? Are you okay?”</p>



<p>Asaki-san, Miyachi, and others started to gather.</p>



<p>“Should I carry you to the infirmary?”</p>



<p>“It’s the finals; you guys have to win.” I declined Nanamura’s offer.</p>



<p>“You’re right. Arisaka-chan, sorry, but could you accompany Sena? Others should cheer for the finals.” Nanamura appointed Yorka as his replacement.</p>



<p>“Asaki-san, I’ll leave the rest to you.”</p>



<p>“Thanks for your hard work. Now, focus on getting proper treatment.”</p>



<p>“Miyachi, thanks for everything too.”</p>



<p>Miyachi flashed a cheeky grin.</p>



<p>“Come on, let’s go,” Yorka offered her shoulder.</p>



<p>Behind us, there’s a ripple of commotion, a reaction to Arisaka Yorka’s unusual actions. The stunning beauty, usually disdainful, approaching a sweaty guy seemed to pique the curiosity of onlookers. Yet, she remained entirely oblivious to the attention.</p>



<p>“All right! Don’t let Sena’s sacrifice go to waste! Let’s win the finals just like this!” Nanamura shouted, drawing attention to himself.</p>



<p>“Nanamu, Sumisumi isn’t dead yet,” Miyachi added.</p>



<p>In this way, the two of them forcefully boost the morale of our Class 2-A. Oddly, their overly enthusiastic cheerleading was exactly what I needed at this moment. Nanamura and Miyachi might have sensed something between Yorka and me.</p>



<p>“…Is it okay?”</p>



<p>As we walked down the hallway, I couldn’t help but ask.</p>



<p>“It feels weird to send you off alone, just like when you saved me from that falling oil painting.”</p>



<p>“That did happen, huh?”</p>



<p>About a year ago, our relationship took a step forward thanks to that incident in the art preparation room.</p>



<p>The short journey from the gym to the infirmary.</p>



<p>Leaning slightly on Yorka, I walked with a profound sense of emotion.</p>


<p>When we reached the infirmary, the school nurse was out.</p>



<p>“I’ll take care of it. Sit over there on the bed,” Yorka instructed while gathering the necessary supplies.</p>



<p>“Can you really handle this?”</p>



<p>“Just be a good patient. For now, cool down your ankle with this,” she said, tossing a can of cooling spray.</p>



<p>“Nice shot. Didn’t know you were a three-point shooter too.”</p>



<p>“…I never knew you could play basketball that well.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s an old skill I picked up.”</p>



<p>In recreational sports events, experienced players or those with good athletic abilities tend to stand out. Basketball, in particular, posed a high difficulty level for amateurs. Most struggle with dribbling, and shooting was even harder. The number of experienced players often determined the outcome.</p>



<p>The fact that we managed to beat Class 2-B, which had three active basketball club members, was thanks to the earnest efforts of the other three players. Otherwise, neither I nor Nanamura could have scored as much.</p>



<p>I took off my socks and sprayed my swollen, hot left ankle.</p>



<p>“Your practice paid off.”</p>



<p>“But playing against someone as amazing as Nanamura made me realize that effort alone won’t cut it. Natural talents indeed exist.”</p>



<p>“Is that why you quit the basketball club?”</p>



<p>She probably heard about my reason for quitting from Miyachi while watching the game.</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“There’s a cold pack in the fridge. Use this,” Yorka sat on the edge of the bed and placed a towel-wrapped item gently on my swollen ankle.</p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s cold.”</p>



<p>“Endure it until the swelling goes down.”</p>



<p>“Sorry for making you do all this.”</p>



<p>“In a way, you got injured because of me. Besides, it’s a good excuse to get away from the gym.”</p>



<p>In the confined space of the infirmary, I couldn’t help but feel a bit nervous. Although I tried to convince myself that it wasn’t much different from the art preparation room, the bed, bearing the weight of both of us, emitted a subtle creak with the slightest movement.</p>



<p>“It would be great if you continued to play basketball.”</p>



<p>“I have no regrets, then or now. If I hadn’t quit, I wouldn’t be dating you. My decision is correct.”</p>



<p>“──Kisumi, you were pretty cool on the court.”</p>



<p>I widened my eyes. Unless I misheard, she just called me by my first name. And she complimented me on being cool.</p>



<p>No, Yorka did say that. Though she probably wanted to run away in embarrassment, she couldn’t move away since she was busy icing my ankle. Blushing all the way to her neck, she desperately avoided eye contact.</p>



<p>“Are you into jocks?”</p>



<p>Overflowing with joy, my brain malfunctioned, and I blurted out a nonsensical question.</p>



<p>“Huh? Do you want me to give you a double ankle sprain until you can’t walk?”</p>



<p>“Wait, sorry! Yorka-chan, forgive me! I’m so happy! I love you!”</p>



<p>“Don’t sneakily whisper love in this situation!”</p>



<p>“As lovers, we should express our feelings honestly, right?”</p>



<p>“Ugh…” Finally, the girl I liked looked in my direction. “Don’t get too carried away just because we’re alone.”</p>



<p>“My love is overflowing, I can’t help it.”</p>



<p>“You’ll get bored soon anyway.”</p>



<p>“If I were a fickle guy, I wouldn’t have harbored a crush for over a year without confessing.”</p>



<p>“Fickle? It’s obvious that I’m a handful, aren’t I?” Yorka tried to maintain her confidence by being defiant.</p>



<p>“Even with all those ‘handful’ moments, I find you cute.”</p>



<p>I’m in love with Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>I’m irresistibly, hopelessly drawn to her.</p>



<p>The girl in front of me was so captivating that I forgot even the pain in my ankle. Just confirming this feeling was happiness enough.</p>



<p>However, something beyond that happened.</p>



<p>“Yorka…?”</p>



<p>“Those who worked hard should be rewarded.”</p>



<p>Yorka hugged me. Her slender arms wrapped around my back like a young child embracing a beloved stuffed animal with all their might.</p>



<p>She remembered the words I spoke on that day when we escaped the classroom together, ‘<em>Those who work hard should get a reward.</em>‘</p>



<p>Pressed against her soft body, I froze. My heartbeat skyrocketed. But it wasn’t just me. Her head was under my chin. I felt her warm breath near my collarbone.</p>



<p>“How bold.”</p>



<p>“Do you dislike it?”</p>



<p>“It’s too amazing; I might just die like this.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want you to die, should I let go?”</p>



<p>“I lied. Don’t let go, ever.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think even couples can stay like this forever.”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind, though.”</p>



<p>I placed my hand on her hip, bringing us even closer. Yorka didn’t resist.</p>



<p>“Shouldn’t the injured guy take a break?”</p>



<p>“This is the best form of treatment.”</p>



<p>“You’re exaggerating.”</p>



<p>“But it’s true.”</p>



<p>“Then, let’s stay like this for a little longer.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s tension gradually subsided. The intoxicating scent of her sweet fragrance made my heart race uncontrollably. Every touch, every warmth, every scent was vividly exchanged between us.</p>



<p>“Does my sweat bother you?” I asked belatedly.</p>



<p>“Not really.”</p>



<p>“Do you have an odor addiction or something?”</p>



<p>“DNA-wise, people who are genetically compatible tend to find each other’s scent pleasant.”</p>



<p>“I like your scent, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“You’re a weirdo, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Thank you for finally calling me by my name. It makes me happy.”</p>



<p>“Only occasionally, okay?”</p>



<p>“That’s enough for now.”</p>



<p>I murmured as Yorka buried her face in my chest.</p>
