<h3>Chapter 3: Before and After Becoming Lovers</h3>

<p>“At last, I’ve got it.”</p>



<p>The name Arisaka Yorka lit up on my smartphone screen. I finally secured her contact information after a year.</p>



<p>“I’ve waited so long…” I collapsed onto my bed, on the verge of tears of joy.</p>



<p>This moment of relaxation in my room marked the culmination of accomplishments I’d lost count of just today, and I couldn’t help but grin.</p>



<p>The journey back after seeing Arisaka off at the station had been the same. Even while chatting during dinner, I was so lost in thought that my sister gave me a suspicious look and said, <em>“Kisumi-kun, you’re grinning too much.”</em></p>



<p>“We’re finally starting to feel like a couple.”</p>



<p>It was an auspicious first day. We walked home together and enjoyed a carefree time at the family restaurant—a typical high school student date. It was the essence of youth.</p>



<p>“Now, what should I send?”</p>



<p>I had been typing and deleting messages for about an hour.</p>



<p><em>I should have just sent a stamp or something impulsively.</em></p>



<p>The pressure not to ruin the lingering atmosphere of the day with a poorly chosen message made me hesitate, that’s why I was still struggling to send the first text.</p>



<p>Unable to come up with a clever message, I decided to give my overworked brain a break and placed my phone by my pillow.</p>



<p>“Who would’ve thought I’d end up dating Arisaka…”</p>



<p>As I gazed at the ceiling, memories of my long friendship with Arisaka Yorka flooded back.</p>


<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>Arisaka Yorka had already become the talk of the school by the time she entered.</p>



<p>A stunning beauty who got the highest score on the entrance exam and refused to deliver the opening speech as the representative of the new students. Even after admission, she consistently secured the top spot in all tests.</p>



<p>Moreover, this mysterious beauty had one peculiar trait — she hated socializing.</p>



<p>Despite attending classes, Arisaka maintained no personal connections beyond that. Every lunch break, she vanished from the classroom, and no one knew where she went.</p>



<p>──The beautiful, aloof honor student at Eisei High, who made no friends, sought none, and kept everyone at a distance.</p>



<p>She wore silence like armor, never flocking with others, and her face never bore a smile. Those who dared to disturb her serene tranquility faced her unrelenting retribution.</p>



<p>During breaks, regardless of class or grade, someone would confess to her. Arisaka, adept as she was, never rejected anyone outright. If someone initiated a conversation, she wouldn’t make eye contact, pretending not to hear, causing about seventy percent to give up. They’d pretend to talk to themselves and move away.</p>



<p>The persistent twenty percent used relentless gestures and actions to forcibly grab her attention. But her cold gaze and beauty overwhelmed them, making them retreat with words trailing off.</p>



<p>The last ten percent, undeterred, persisted in expressing their feelings unilaterally. To these perpetrators of borderline harassment, Arisaka had only one response:</p>



<p>“You’re a nuisance.”</p>



<p>Her consistent attitude spread throughout the school, and by the end of last Golden Week, those foolish enough to confess had completely disappeared. Arisaka, with her threefold crown of appearance, intellect, and indifference, became unapproachable even to her classmates.</p>



<p>High schoolers weren’t children who took “getting along with everyone” literally. Choosing relationships while seeking an optimal level of mutual comfort was a sign of developed social skills.</p>



<p>In this way, the beauty known as Arisaka Yorka became an untouchable presence that could only be observed. This was a stance Arisaka desired, and as long as one refrained from meddling, no issues arose.</p>



<p>However, the school, responsible for its students, couldn’t just let it be.</p>



<p>Arisaka’s preference for silence and indifference puzzled her homeroom teacher, Kanzaki Shizuru. Concerned about her low level of participation in class, Kanzaki-sensei decided to intervene and find someone to be the bridge between Arisaka and the rest of the class.</p>



<p>The responsibility fell on me, Sena Kisumi. The reason was simple, I was in the same class as Arisaka and served as the class representative.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san deliberately avoids building connections with others.”</p>



<p>“It seems like she’s really not good at socializing, huh?”</p>



<p>“Rather than not being good, it’s more like she just hates it. So, Sena-san, could you become close to her?”</p>



<p>This beautiful teacher always threw impossible tasks at me out of nowhere.</p>



<p>“──Kanzaki-sensei, this conversation is taking quite a drastic turn.”</p>



<p>“You can do it, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>The beautiful female teacher insisted on my capability.</p>



<p>“No matter how much others tried to talk to her, it was all in vain. Pushing normalcy onto someone special like Arisaka is not the way to go. She always disappears from the classroom during lunch break.” I expressed my honest opinion, trying to evade this impossible mission.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san is usually in the art prep room. Sena-san, please go.”</p>



<p>For some reason, Kanzaki-sensei knew her whereabouts.</p>



<p>“Wouldn’t it be better if someone of the same gender handles such a delicate issue? As a guy, my presence might raise unnecessary alarms.”</p>



<p>I tried to gently refuse again with what seemed like a reasonable excuse, but refusal wasn’t an option from the start.</p>



<p>“Anyway, just go to the art prep room once. We’ll talk after that.”</p>



<p>Unable to resist Kanzaki-sensei’s insistence, I reluctantly went to the art prep room where Arisaka was supposedly hiding.</p>



<p>“You’re a nuisance. Go back. Just disappear.”</p>



<p>Of course, Arisaka wouldn’t welcome an outsider. She bombarded me with three consecutive rejection words as if launching a preemptive strike.</p>



<p>As I observed cautiously from behind the door, Arisaka embodied wariness. She looked extremely displeased, radiating maximum hostility.</p>



<p>She watched me without letting her guard down, attempting to drive me away with just her sharp gaze. Normally, one would retreat under the pressure of her intense stare.</p>



<p>However, what caught me off guard was Arisaka, who should have taken the initiative silently, actually speaking.</p>



<p>“Sena-kun, how did you find this place?” Arisaka eyed me suspiciously as I stood before the door.</p>



<p>“Oh, you know my name?”</p>



<p>“You’re the class rep. Just answer.” Arisaka’s interrogative tone suggested she had a suspect in mind.</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-sensei told me,” I innocently replied. I didn’t want to risk upsetting Arisaka any further by hiding it.</p>



<p>“That teacher! You didn’t tell anyone else, right?”</p>



<p>“I didn’t.”</p>



<p>“Good. Don’t ever tell anyone. Now, goodbye. Don’t come back.” She declared firmly, determined to keep anyone out of her territory.</p>



<p>“You aren’t really socially awkward, huh?”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Because you can converse normally. But in the classroom, you’re always silent.”</p>



<p>“There’s no one worth talking to.”</p>



<p>“I see. I hope you find someone soon.”</p>



<p>“Mind your own business.”</p>



<p>“Alright, how about I be your practice partner, then?” I offered, attempting to fulfill the given role.</p>



<p>“What kind of logic is that? You’re wasting my time.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, it’s a task from the teacher. Bear with me.”</p>



<p>“Tsk, teacher’s pet.”</p>



<p>“What you said is really unpleasant.” I chuckled at the refreshing bluntness of her words.</p>



<p>“If you don’t want to hear abusive language, then disappear from here.”</p>



<p>“At least you’re aware of the abuse.”</p>



<p>“Is that a problem?”</p>



<p>“Well, it just occurred to me – we’re talking quite a bit, aren’t we?” As far as I knew, no student had ever conversed with Arisaka for this long. This might be a new record.</p>



<p>“Who cares!” Arisaka forcefully closed the door.</p>



<p>This marked our third encounter.</p>



<p>Although I felt uneasy heading to the art prep room, meeting her turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. Somehow, she was unexpectedly interesting when you talked to her.</p>



<p>That’s how, without a hint of romantic interest at first, I found myself visiting the art prep room whenever I had some free time, driven merely by idle curiosity.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>“You’re persistent! Go away!”</p>



<p>As usual, Arisaka tried to drive me away with her sharp attitude and verbal attacks. She must really value her alone time in the art prep room. To an outsider, it probably looked like I was being rejected every day. Fortunately, being located at the edge of the school building meant our interactions went unnoticed by others.</p>



<p>We spent a while talking outside the door.</p>



<p>“Sena-kun, ever heard of giving up?”</p>



<p>“I’m just enjoying your abuse more than you think.”</p>



<p>“Are you a masochist?” She looked genuinely disgusted.</p>



<p>“You can figure out my kink from just chatting!? Arisaka, you’re incredible!”</p>



<p>“How did it come to this?”</p>



<p>“Well, well, since the cafeteria is insanely crowded today, could you let me have lunch here?”</p>



<p>“No way.”</p>



<p>As I joked around, she earnestly got angry. It was strange that she responded to me so seriously, unlike how she would with others. Perhaps she’s worried about her secret base being exposed.</p>



<p>For me, it was merely enjoying the amusing banter with Arisaka. She was too much of a beauty for me to even consider her as a potential romantic interest. So, while there was tension, I could talk to her without any pressure.</p>



<p>“…Wait, did your mouth get injured or something?”</p>



<p>Despite being angry, Arisaka noticed quickly. Even though she usually seemed disinterested in others, her eyes were sharp.</p>



<p>“I got distracted and accidentally bumped into something,” I casually explained.</p>



<p>“You’re so clumsy. Didn’t you come here by accident too? So just quietly leave.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t say we should have a fun chat. I’ll just sit here and eat.”</p>



<p>“You’re annoying. There are plenty of other places to eat, you know?”</p>



<p>“Come on. Every once in a while, having lunch with someone might change your mood, Arisaka.”</p>



<p>“Thanks to you, I’m feeling nauseous.”</p>



<p>“That’s tough. Maybe you should rest in the nurse’s office. Don’t worry; I’ll keep watch here for you.”</p>



<p>“I told you to leave!”</p>



<p>Frustration toward me must have built up. Almost threateningly, Arisaka forcefully slammed her hand against the shelf holding oil paintings.</p>



<p>The shelves swayed, and I noticed the oil painting stacked on the top one was about to collapse, aiming to land right on her head.</p>



<p>“Arisaka!”</p>



<p>I tossed my lunch aside and rushed into the art prep room, instinctively covering her as the sharp edge of the canvas landed heavily on me.</p>



<p>“Ugh!?”</p>



<p>The wooden frame was solid, and pain shot through my back, shoulders, arms, and the back of my head, reflexively tensing my entire body.</p>



<p>In that moment, I unintentionally ended up embracing her tightly.</p>



<p>“────!”</p>



<p>I heard her gasp near my ear. However, due to enduring the pain, I hadn’t comprehended the situation. We both lost our balance, collapsing to the floor in a tangled heap.</p>



<p>When I opened my eyes, Arisaka’s face was right in front of me.</p>



<p>“Intrusion. Sexual harassment. Assault.”</p>



<p>Tears welled up in her eyes as she laid rigid beneath me.</p>



<p>I quickly moved away from Arisaka while staggering because of the pain. The fall from the oil painting, along with hitting my elbows and knees during the fall, made standing up difficult. My whole body hurt so much I felt like crying.</p>



<p>“Sorry,” I apologized for now.</p>



<p>Glancing at the floor, my lunch—once a sandwich—laid crushed beneath the fallen oil painting. The pain was still excruciating, and any trace of my appetite had vanished.</p>



<p>All that left was an awkward silence.</p>



<p>Arisaka slowly stood up, staring down at me. “It’s fortunate we’re at the far end of the school. Even if I scream, no one will hear.”</p>



<p>“My bad, I got carried away. This is my fault.”</p>



<p>“Geez, we’ll need to clean up this mess.”</p>



<p>“I’ll handle it.”</p>



<p>“In either case, you can’t move for a while, right?”</p>



<p>I remained seated on the floor, leaning against the wall until the pain subsided.</p>



<p>“…Fair point. How about you? Any injuries?”</p>



<p>“My butt hurts. If I make a fuss, maybe I won’t have to see your face again in the school.”</p>



<p>Terrified by the fear of someone else holding the power of life and death over me, I shivered. While threatening to turn my high school life into hell, Arisaka casually rubbed her plump ass through her skirt.</p>



<p><em>No. If things go badly, will I be kicked out of school? Cut me some slack!</em></p>



<p>“Why are you flaunting your butt in front of a guy?”</p>



<p>For someone who always presented herself perfectly, wasn’t this a bit careless?</p>



<p>“Don’t stare so intently!”</p>



<p>Bang! Out of nowhere, Arisaka’s long legs extended right next to my face, delivering an astonishingly sharp kick against the wall.</p>



<p>I held my breath and froze. “A-Are you trying to kill me?”</p>



<p>When I returned to my senses, I realized the true nature of the scene before my eyes.</p>



<p>What came into view was her underwear. Because of her high kick, I found myself looking directly inside her skirt, revealing an intricate lace design in bright red.</p>



<p>I averted my face frantically, but the image was imprinted vividly in my memory.</p>



<p>“…This is both heaven and hell,” I muttered under my breath.</p>



<p>“Feeling like heaven in this situation? You’re quite the carefree one, aren’t you?” Arisaka snapped, completely oblivious to her daring actions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><div><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TVg5JbCn104sJifcMQjjXtAgxCcsIa8Ow78nT1ZULaiqUJ6yJqZtrr47JpvmcJPJVZb0aTvWV_q-qenVJQHngjNlYX0p1PkA7y2qMR-gLcB9cadh97CvzQs1nZXu-dUWlhbi_A9lWVsd94w-JTQbob0" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>“My brain can’t compare to the genius who aced the exams… Now…can you please get your legs off? I’m begging you.”</p>



<p>“Would heaven be getting further away?”</p>



<p>“Are you a pervert or what?! Your panties are on full display!”</p>



<p>“──Uh, w-wait!”</p>



<p>Arisaka, who had realized the current situation, hurriedly retracted her leg and clutched the hem of her skirt. She retreated all the way to the window, her face as red as an apple.</p>



<p>“Y-y-y-you saw?”</p>



<p>“I’ll make an effort to forget.”</p>



<p>“Just say you didn’t see anything!”</p>



<p>“Then, wear something less conspicuous! It’s way too sexy!”</p>



<p>“I wear it because it’s cute! Men have no business criticizing my underwear preferences.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s true…”</p>



<p>Our eyes met, and both of us fell into an awkward silence. That weird fluttering sensation still coursed through my body. Arisaka was clearly filled with regret about her carelessness.</p>



<p>The air became increasingly tense. I endured the pain and stood up. “Anyway, I’ll clean this up properly.”</p>



<p>“Shouldn’t you go to the nurse’s office first?”</p>



<p>“Then, after school, I’ll take care of it.”</p>



<p>I picked up the scattered paintings and leaned them against the wall. It was still tough to reach the top shelf and put the paintings back. Yet, leaving this place and walking away from this situation didn’t feel right.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to come back.”</p>



<p>When I left the room, Arisaka said those words to my departing back.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>After school that day, as I had mentioned, I once again visited the art prep room.</p>



<p>“You’re unbelievable. I can’t believe you actually came,” Arisaka said, still at school. The oil paintings remained as I’d left them.</p>



<p>“A man’s gotta keep his word,” I replied, busying myself stacking the paintings on the shelf.</p>



<p>“You’re quite the healthy one, Sena-kun.”</p>



<p>“What’s with the moralistic textbook-like expression?”</p>



<p>“I mean, you’re really diligent, almost excessively so.”</p>



<p>She looked exasperated, not even showing a sign to help. She remained seated in her usual chair, unmoving.</p>



<p>“If you were a bit more flexible with your relationships, I wouldn’t have to come here. You know how persistent Kanzaki-sensei is, right?”</p>



<p>“Let’s avoid talking about that teacher.”</p>



<p>“…Why do you dislike her so much?”</p>



<p>While Arisaka was indifferent to other teachers, she had glimpses of emotion in her dealings with Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“Since before I even enrolled, she’s been far too concerned, more than anyone else. She probably took notice when I turned down being the student representative at the entrance ceremony. Ugh, how annoying!”</p>



<p>I had no idea there had been such interactions between Arisaka and Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>Arisaka’s complaints continued.</p>



<p>“She insists on me attending classes, but as long as I’m top of the grade, there should be no complaints, right? She shouldn’t be meddling in high school students’ lives like this. She even calls me for ‘counseling’ every time. And if I tell her I find it unbearable to be in the classroom, she suggests I use the art prep room…”</p>



<p>“She’s probably just worried about you.”</p>



<p>So that’s how Kanzaki-sensei knew where Arisaka was.</p>



<p>“Then she sends a pervert in here. What the hell is she thinking?”</p>



<p>“Hold off on that title! That was an accident, and mostly all guys are perverts!”</p>



<p>“Don’t be so nonchalant!”</p>



<p>“It’s just a fact.”</p>



<p>After exchanging a brief glare, Arisaka sighed loudly. “Honestly, I envy types like you, Sena-kun, who can blend into the background.”</p>



<p>“Is that supposed to be an insult?”</p>



<p>“Partially. The other half is the truth.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t come up with a retort.</p>



<p>“In a world where so many people want to stand out but can’t, it’s a luxurious complaint.”</p>



<p>“I hate standing out! I wish everyone would leave me alone! I don’t want anyone to care about me!” Arisaka shouted with fervor, then, in an almost resigned manner, she lowered her head. “I’m sorry. Forget what I—”</p>



<p>“Arisaka, I’ll forget everything. So tell me all of it.” I assured her without even thinking.</p>



<p>“Complaining to you, Sena-kun, won’t change anything. It’s foolish.”</p>



<p>“Even if it’s just a complaint or frustration, it’s fine. Don’t worry; even if I talk about it, nobody would believe me.”</p>



<p>“──You’re not that kind of person.”</p>



<p>Arisaka Yorka said that with certainty.</p>



<p>“The position of class representative seems to carry more trust than I thought,” I tried to hide my embarrassment.</p>



<p>Arisaka hesitated for a brief moment before getting up from her seat.</p>



<p>“I’ll make some coffee. Sena-kun, would you like some too?”</p>



<p>In the depths of the art prep room, Arisaka’s personal items were carefully hidden away. There was a TV, a game console, books, even a refrigerator.</p>



<p>She swiftly boiled water in an electric kettle and prepared coffee for the both of us. This wasn’t instant; it was a proper drip brew. Arisaka, with her apparent sweet tooth, added plenty of milk and sugar.</p>



<p>The contrast was somehow endearing, even amusing.</p>



<p>“Sena-kun, do you want to add milk and sugar?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine with black.”</p>



<p>I received the mug as I had finished returning all the oil paintings to the shelf.</p>



<p>Honestly, I couldn’t distinguish the taste of coffee much, but the aroma was undeniably inviting. The sunlight streaming in through the window was hinting at the approaching dusk.</p>



<p>Then, Arisaka Yorka began to speak softly.</p>



<p>“Being seen by others feels scary, like there are expectations. I’m not doing anything particularly special myself. I was born with this appearance, and people can’t help but stare. I study just like everyone else, and it just happened that I scored the highest on the tests. This is my ‘normal.’ I didn’t choose it, and I didn’t wish for it.”</p>



<p>I nodded. Ignoring a beauty like Arisaka was indeed a tough task. “The Arisaka Yorka others expect and the real you are different. The gap between them is what makes it painful, right?”</p>



<p>“It feels like that. I’m not as amazing as people think. I don’t possess something that makes me deserving of such high praise.”</p>



<p>Oh, she’s definitely a serious and delicate type. She wanted people to see the real her, not just the surface. But…</p>



<p>“Arisaka, you don’t quite understand what you desire,” I said quietly.</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“You’ve been delivering results that surpass ordinary people, and naturally, both you and others came to expect that. But it’s also made daily life pressurizing. Yet, even though you’ve achieved so much, you don’t find anything particularly rewarding or enjoyable. So, it’s challenging to find a balance within yourself.”</p>



<p>I put into words the image of a girl named Arisaka Yorka that emerged within me.</p>



<p>“It’s just that I can’t get passionate about anything. I’m a rather lonely person.” Arisaka’s sad eyes were fixed on her coffee mug.</p>



<p>“I think Arisaka is pretty cool.”</p>



<p>Was “cool” an appropriate term to compliment a female classmate? I couldn’t be entirely sure. But it was the truth, no faking it.</p>



<p>“No matter how you flatter me, you won’t get anything other than coffee.”</p>



<p>“You’ve got to be strong-willed to avoid being swept up in others’ values. You could easily get carried away and act all high and mighty, but you’re earnestly seeking what fulfills you.”</p>



<p>My attraction to her extended far beyond her physical beauty—it was her inner charm.</p>



<p>“Seeking what fulfills me…” Arisaka repeated my words slowly.</p>



<p>“I hope you find it someday.”</p>



<p>“Well, why do I keep blabbering on like this when I’m talking with you, Sena-kun?” Suddenly, Arisaka grew angry.</p>



<p>“What are you so mad about? Did I say something that off the mark?”</p>



<p>“You’re definitely the cause.”</p>



<p>“Come on now. Don’t get serious about a guy like me.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Serious? That’s totally not it,” Arisaka scoffed.</p>



<p>“You were the one who got mad and showed me your panties. Thanks to that, I missed my lunch.”</p>



<p>“That, um, was an accident… Geez! Don’t mess with my pace. I really hate you!”</p>



<p>That day, our pointless chatter didn’t stop.</p>



<p>Strangely, even while angry, Arisaka brought more coffee and served it with a side of madeleines.</p>



<p>As the full-fledged summer arrived, I officially quit the basketball club and found myself visiting the art prep room almost every day after school.</p>



<p>Before long, Arisaka stopped complaining about me coming there.</p>


<p>As I was reminiscing about my first encounter with Arisaka, I apparently drifted off to sleep. What woke me was the sound of my phone’s ringtone.</p>



<p>To my surprise, the sender of the message was none other than Arisaka Yorka herself.</p>



<p>“What the…?”</p>



<p>The sleepiness had blown away instantly, and I sat up in bed. Never in my wildest dreams did I think she’d contact me while I was grappling with all these thoughts.</p>



<p>I carefully tapped the screen and opened her message.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Send a word or two at least!</em></p>



<p>“A pushy text message!?”</p>



<p>Surprising indeed. I had imagined that even if I sent messages, they’d be left on ‘read.’</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Did we perhaps fail at exchanging contact info?</em></p>



<p>As I contemplated what to reply, another message came through. Her concern was evident from the text.</p>



<p><em>For someone who gets irritated when being pestered, she’s quite anxious when there’s no response.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>No worries. I received your text just fine.</em></p>



<p>I easily responded. I felt silly for being so anxious earlier.</p>



<p>Her reply arrived almost instantly.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Took you long enough.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Were you lonely?</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>That goes for you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>You caught me. I’d welcome messages from my girlfriend anytime.</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>…Your enthusiasm is showing.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Just my fingers are moving excitedly (lol).</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Calm down.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>I’m always ready for more texts!</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>You can send one too.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>That means late-night chats, you know.</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>…If I were free, I might not mind.</em></p>



<p>When it came to chatting on LINE, Arisaka was pretty straightforward. Her quick responses indicated she was enjoying our conversation.</p>



<p>Compared to the time we first spoke in the art prep room last year, our relationship had developed in ways I wouldn’t have believed. A year ago, I never would have thought I’d be in a relationship with Arisaka.</p>



<p>When I imagined her on the other side of the screen, I glanced outside the window. The night sky was clear, not a single cloud in sight. In Tokyo, you had to squint to see even a single star, but the moon shone brilliantly.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>That’s one small step for a lover, one giant leap for Sena Kisumi.</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Why the Neil Armstrong reference?</em></p>



<p>As expected, Arisaka knew the name of the astronaut who was the first human to set foot on the moon.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>The moon is beautiful, isn’t it?</em><sup data-fn="0bd295b3-bc01-42bd-90f7-f69038c3f37d" class="fn"><a href="#0bd295b3-bc01-42bd-90f7-f69038c3f37d" id="0bd295b3-bc01-42bd-90f7-f69038c3f37d-link">1</a></sup></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Now you’re quoting Natsume Souseki.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>The essence of the words is what matters most.</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Alright, alright.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Not a fan of literature, huh? Fine, let me be clear.</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>I know what it means!</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>I like you, Arisaka.</em></p>



<p>Her response paused.</p>



<p>“Did I go too far?”</p>



<p>Just as I started feeling somewhat regretful, one last message came through.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Don’t push it. Goodnight!</em></p>



<p>I replied with a quick “Goodnight!”</p>
