<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Cecyl’s Desire and the Reward Whereabouts</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the open wall, there&#8217;s a long stairway that leads to the basement.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I thought, the wall can be opened by ancient language. But, like a key, it requires Cecyl to touch it. It probably reacts to the magical power or perhaps the demon race&#8217;s blood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, it&#8217;s better if we just go back. There is a phrase that says &#8220;Curiosity killed the cat&#8221; ー but I&#8217;m too curious to leave it alone. If it&#8217;s true there&#8217;s a demon race&#8217;s legacy over here, then I hope Cecyl will inherit it as the lineage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If it&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s a demon race&#8217;s legacy over here, then how about I give Nagi-sama the legacy?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl says that as she follows my steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that why you&#8217;re in high spirits? No, that&#8217;s a no. Cecyl&#8217;s possession is Cecyl&#8217;s. After all, I&#8217;m the master who came from a democratic nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We go down the stairs in the following sequence, Rita, Cecyl, and I. The position is so that Rita can sense the monsters by using【Presence Sense】and evade the traps by using body techniques. Cecyl senses the magical power while I protect the rear. Like that, we descend from the height of about a second-floor building slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrive at the basement that was sealed by the demon magician. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is this the demon&#8217;s legacy…?」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside the damp room, Cecyl says in a daze. It&#8217;s a basement that’s the size of a school classroom. The room that is illuminated by Cecyl&#8217;s common version of 【Light】…is surprisingly dreary. Though I was imagined that there would be treasure chests lining up because it&#8217;s a hidden chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a wooden desk and a chair. Parchments are stacking on the top of it. Dried ink and a pen. I can&#8217;t read the characters on the parchment. It&#8217;s probably in the ancient language because I can&#8217;t read it even by【Foreign World Language】. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Found itー」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita who is exploring the room crawls out from under the desk. She hands me over a small crystal ball to me while her golden tail is wagging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I found it, master. Excellent?」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yeah. Thank you, Rita.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Excellent?」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*pikopiko*</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her golden ears are twitching as if she&#8217;s expecting something. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uhmm, this is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Rita is really excellent.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Haun…」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita&#8217;s face becomes entranced as I stroke her head. What is this cute animal……</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is this……a skill orb?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s right. Its effect is 【Ancient Language Interpretation LV3】.」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I take the orb from Rita. Let&#8217;s take a look its concept. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">【Ancient Language Interpretation LV3】</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">【Translate】the【Ancient Language】into 【Modern Language】skill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes. This one is for Cecyl.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi-sama…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl trembles. She stretches her small hand to take the skill orb, but then she stops on the top of my hand as she becomes perplexed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I, this… don&#8217;t want it.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There&#8217;s no choice since both of us don&#8217;t have【Ancient Language】skill. Plus, if it&#8217;s something that is left by the demon race, then it&#8217;d be better if I give it to Cecyl.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi-sama…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cecyl trembles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;m……scared.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Scared?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes……I don&#8217;t know the demon race other than my parents and Ashtarte. Both my parents and Ashtarte told me not to hate humans. But I don&#8217;t know what others are thinking.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl says that. The demon race is a part of nature as their life and soul are vicissitudes. It was a natural phenomenon that they were destroyed by the human race. Like a tree which doesn&#8217;t resent the wind that sweeps off its branches, like a flower which doesn&#8217;t resent the rainwater that washes its petals ー the demon race doesn&#8217;t resent the humans who had destroyed them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can&#8217;t be helped to hate the ones who killed Cecyl&#8217;s family but it&#8217;s different to hate all the human raceー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「However, there is probably demon race who not like that. But I&#8217;m afraid if something changes…before I know it.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the first time for Cecyl to be anxious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, I want to know it. It probably does something really good to Nagi-sama, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t want to regret not summoning my courage at that time…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl takes the skill orb and bites her lips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yeah. Don&#8217;t overwork yourself. Let&#8217;s leave this place and return home.After all, our motto is don&#8217;t do it if it&#8217;s unreasonable.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Jeez.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Cecyl tilts her head as if she&#8217;s annoyed and laughs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If Nagi-sama is like that, then I can do whatever I like, right?」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl turns her back to me and unties the cloth&#8217;s collar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smoothly, her back exposes ー she&#8217;s probably want to install the skill orb that she received from me. Spontaneously, I avert my eyes since it&#8217;s something that I shouldn&#8217;t look at. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl wears her clothes back and picks up a parchment on the top of the desk.  Taking a deep breath, Cecyl reads the written ancient language. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I&#8217;m telling thou, my brethren. When thou find this letter and read it out loud, the room will reveal its true form.』<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……Eh?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My underfoot is shining. A pure white symbol emerges from the floor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is thisーa magic square? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is it a booby trap!?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, to someone who is the same race. How malicious! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi-sama!!」「Nagi!!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them come and hug me. My vision starts to waver. The world is dyed in white. Before I know it, my consciousness blacks out.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room really has changed into a different form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of water. It&#8217;s a room with high ceiling. Its size is about a gymnasium. The wall is gleaming with faint bluish-white light. We fell at the center of the room. A magic square is under us. Even though the floor is covered with white stones, it&#8217;s bare ground everywhere as trees grow from the ground. Water is flowing out from the wall and it flows to the center of the room. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that the sound of water just now? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Where is this place…」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…It&#8217;s the original basement. Looks like this one is its true form…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl says it. She shakes her head as she gets up and points at the magic square across the wall. Over there, there are characters that similar to what is written on the parchment. Cecyl&#8217;s eyes are tracing the characters. She seems to have stopped letting out her voice after considering what just happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl let out a small sigh after reading them for a while. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi-sama, Rita-san……I&#8217;m sorry. 」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s alright, but what is written on the wall?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s written that the demon race magician who lived here was the one who summoned the cursed sword in the dungeon.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……Haa!?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Cecyl, the story is something like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 100 years ago, the magician who lived in this mansion was afraid of human assault towards the demon race, so in order to oppose them, he summoned a【Cursed Sword】from another world. This place is for the sake of performing the summoning ritual. The location is established so that underground water where the magical power dwells can be drawn in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the summoning failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cursed sword collects magical power nearby ー and it becomes the 【Wandering Sword】that appears in the dungeon at a constant cycle which is passed to human hands over a period of time. The magician who didn&#8217;t want to give up calling out the demon race. If you have the power then show it and get my legacy. And then I want you to regain the demon race worldーsomething like that</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Annoying.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good grief. I understand your feelings but if you had summoned the cursed sword then I wanted you to retrieve it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Then how we are going to return to our previous location……」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「By using stairs. You can climb it up and get to the surface.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s good.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Not good. I feel sick…」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita is still crouching. Looks like the change of atmosphere is so intense that the semicircular canals are stimulated. Her tail and ears are flat and lying on the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is it because of the cursed sword summoning…? 」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s no monster&#8217;s presence nearby. The air is clear and the water is clean too. Red berries grow on the trees. Why don&#8217;t I live here when the time comes……</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi-sama…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl looks at me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">……Eh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do you look like you&#8217;re going to cry? She bites her lips while her eyes become watery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t hate humans.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yeah.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I also never thought about revenge. I don&#8217;t want something like a cursed sword. I&#8217;m sad that my parents died and I want to punch the ones who killed them if they are in front of me, but I don&#8217;t hate all the human race. Please believe me.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I believe you.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Cecyl wouldn&#8217;t stay with me if she hates human. Her relationship with Rita is also good. When the 【Leviathan】attacked the people of the cult, it was Cecyl who worried more than me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I never doubt you, Cecyl.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, I&#8217;m……scared.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Cecyl grabs the hem of my shirt again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Perhaps, there&#8217;s a grudge towards humans in this blood and someday, I might come to hate humans…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Is it something like a subconscious?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t really know but it&#8217;s something like that.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, it won&#8217;t do anything to Cecyl, right?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ashtarte said to meー&#8217;Go to Metekal once you get out from the slave shop&#8217;.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl says that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The reasons are the population is big and my appearance as a dark elf is accepted here or perhaps……Ashtarte knows about this place and to me…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「There&#8217;s a possibility but it&#8217;s impossible.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We came here because of the quest. A hot spring has sprung out nearby and the merchant decided to buy this mansion. There&#8217;s no way Ashtarte can manipulate such things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example&#8230;it&#8217;s just an assumption but since the demon race is a part of nature, and when Cecyl becomes alone, spontaneously, an effect is triggered which caused a reaction in the earth crust and a hot spring springs up ー like that, we came to this place or something like that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that&#8217;s impossible. In the first place, Cecyl can&#8217;t read 【Ancient Language】if I hadn&#8217;t used 【Reconstruction Ability】.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Nagi-sama.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Cecyl touches my left hand. The ring which appeared when we made the 【Contract】.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Can you『Command』me?」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「……Command?」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s right. Like that, you will know what I want in my mind.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the ring to give a command. Surely, it&#8217;s used to force a slave to listen to whatever the master says. It&#8217;s easy to use, just by touching the ring and say the word 『Doー』.In instant, the slave&#8217;s consciousness is cut off and forced to abide the master&#8217;s command. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Please. Please command me. Nagi-sama.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t want…」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「W-why? I already said that I&#8217;m fine, right? Isn&#8217;t it a legal privilege for a slave master!? Please use it!」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Because you see, I don&#8217;t make the contract because I want you to listen to my command or this type of service. It is because I want Cecyl to work harder.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Please. Nagi-sama</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m scared.I don&#8217;t what is in deep inside me. And then someday, it takes over me and hurts Nagi-sama without I aware it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">……That&#8217;s why…that&#8217;s why…」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears are flowing out from Cecyl&#8217;s eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ahー.Cecyl-chan is crying. You shouldn&#8217;t do that, Nagi.」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「When did you come back, Rita.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「From a little while ago. I was listening to the story. Nagi is bad.」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I can&#8217;t just give a command.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A person who doesn&#8217;t understand a girl&#8217;s feeling is the worst.」<em>(Rita)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita hugs Cecyl while glaring at me. Before I know it, it&#8217;s 2 against 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I also understand if it&#8217;s something like this.I&#8217;ll be anxious because I&#8217;m different from others as there&#8217;s no one like me in the world. I want to have a peace of mind. I want to know if there&#8217;s someone who still accepts me even though he knows the truth about myself.」<em>(Cecyl)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I believe in Cecyl.」<em>(Nagi)</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking even if Cecyl awakens the demon race&#8217;s mission. If Cecyl becomes a queen, then I can be the staff officer which I can live freely. Though I will stop if you tell me something like destroying the human race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Besides, I hate to give orders.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I won&#8217;t hate Nagi just because you give orders.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, that&#8217;s not the case. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Cecyl-chan also won&#8217;t hate Nagi.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I won&#8217;t. Absolutely.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「See? It&#8217;s just whether Nagi can accept Cecyl-chan&#8217;s feeling or not.」 </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaーjeez.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s with the “master” getting ordered to “order me!” by his slave?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Alright. I understand. Good grief, it&#8217;ll be just this once.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl wipes her tears and smiles. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t actually care about the thing that exists inside Cecyl&#8217;s consciousness.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Nagi-sama.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Let&#8217;s finish this quickly.  Cecyl stands over there and Rita…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;m alright. Because I&#8217;ll kick Nagi if he tries to do something strange when Cecyl-chan&#8217;s consciousness is out.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t threaten your master. Especially with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl is also smiling too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…【Command】 huh?  I really don&#8217;t want to do it. I touch the red crystal on my left-hand ring. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Under the supervision of the 【Contract】, my slave Cecyl Pharott, I command thee.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red crystal shines. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「──────」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that the light of purpose has disappeared from Cecyl&#8217;s eyes. I declare. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Cecyl Pharott. Tell thy true desire that sleeps in thy heart.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「──a──ah.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl&#8217;s body becomes stiff. Her cherry blossom lips start to move faintly. While trembling. It seems that she hesitates to speak her desire that exists deep inside her heart. But the 【Command】slowly immerses inside Cecylー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl speaks her desire that exists deep inside her heart by herself clearly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I want to have Nagi-sama&#8217;s child.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While stroking the stomach area with her slender fingersー</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/zm3Pkb8/87926.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　……………………Eh？</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「For the first one, I want a boy like Nagi-sama.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Err..wait a minute, Cecyl-san? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「If I can, then I want a boy for the second one. Because if it&#8217;s a girl, then the boy will obsess with her. Still, it&#8217;s better if we don&#8217;t rush for the second one too much. O-of course, Nagi-sama probably doesn&#8217;t want a partner like me. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll do my best. I&#8217;ll work harder and become splendid like Rita-san. After that…surely. And then, slowly…I want Nagi-sama to teach me various thing…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　……………………</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s better not to leave the record of what Cecyl talks about afterward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when you&#8217;re in middle school or upper elementary school and you have someone you like, won&#8217;t you have a delusion going out with that person? And you inadvertently write that delusion in the notebook on a sleepless night? Cecyl talks about it in detail way more than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, R-18 elements are being added up properly. With full utilization of the knowledge that Cecyl knows, it&#8217;s being decorated even more. I writhe in agony when I try to read it again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were the kinds of things that, if seen by anyone else, you could only change schools or give up on life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　……………………</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I seeー, so Cecyl is thinking about such thingsー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I seeー, so Cecyl was doing such things when I was sleepingー </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m surprisedー.Or rather, it&#8217;s enough already.This 【Command】, won&#8217;t it stops until she speaks out all her desire? Is it? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Hey, Rita.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What, Nagi.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「The things I just heard, I think I&#8217;ll take it to the grave.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Count me in. I&#8217;m thinking the same thing too.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「As expected of my slave.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「As expected of my master.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We didn&#8217;t hear anything.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「We didn&#8217;t hear anything. But, Nagi.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is it?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi…are you the one who won&#8217;t wake her up once you fall asleep?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I was just tired coming to another world!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「But, I don&#8217;t know. That there&#8217;s a technique to make the chest bigger for the demon race.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…………」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It will be more effective not to wear anything, such a strange tradition, isn&#8217;t it? And Cecyl-chan is doing her best every nightー」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s why take it to the grave!!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Again, I&#8217;m sorry Nagi. For thinking you were doing ecchi things to Cecyl-chan.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t want an apology right now…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Rather, I think you have a massive amount of self-control.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It’s being whittled down, in the present progressive tense.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Do your bestー」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Rita, aren&#8217;t you enjoying yourself?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Do you understand?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I extremely understand it.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Rather than enjoying, I think I&#8217;m going to have fun.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What is that.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「A hint. Cecyl-chan is a girl.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I know that.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And then, I&#8217;m a girl too.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…I know that too.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I won&#8217;t tell you anymore. So, Nagi, do your bestー」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, Rita puts her hand on her lips and smiles. As if matching with the timing, Cecyl who is talking earnestly pauses. Like that, she falls down to her kneeー watch out!! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stretch my hands in a hurry and catch her small body in my arms. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Oi, Cecyl. Are you alright?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi…-sama.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl opens her eyes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good. It&#8217;s the normal Cecyl. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「My 【Subconscious】ー what did it say?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「………At least it didn&#8217;t say that it hates human beings.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Why are you averting your eyes?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It was actually a peaceful desire, yeah.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「What did it say? Myself.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Uhmm…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translating the words that Cecyl said…that is</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「You said that『I want a family』.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Ah.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl&#8217;s eyes sparkle. She seems to have recalled something. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「T-that&#8217;s right. I want a family. I&#8217;m sure about that!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good. Looks like she&#8217;s convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I&#8217;m glad……I don&#8217;t hate humans.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Rather, you said that you love them.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the point, I feel cautious. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thank you…Nagi-sama.With this, I can relax…and stay with Nagi-sama. I see. I want a family, isn&#8217;t it…」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecy nods many times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a family by yourself as a substitute for the family members that you lost. To connect the demon race&#8217;s blood in the future as it can be any form. After all, that&#8217;s her 【Subconscious】&#8217;s desire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I don&#8217;t know how I can thank Nagi-sama enough. Since I have understood what my【Desire】is , I think I&#8217;ll do my best to make my dream of creating a family come true while serving Nagi-sama.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yeah. That would be great.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Someday, Nagi-sama too…just a little bit is enough, I&#8217;d be really happy for your assistance.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yeah. If that’s all, then it&#8217;s good.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ーEh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita’s jaw drops. Then she puts her hand on her forehead like “oh jeez”. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Cecyl-chan&#8217;s dream』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita communicates with me using lip sync.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『To ”create”』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『a replacement family』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『with assistance』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『from Nagi』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　…………………………………Ah.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took that as a commitment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the demon race magician&#8217;s message, the legacy is concealed in the neighbor room. The door is sealed with 【Ancient Language】so I have Cecyl to open it. The room next to the basement is completely a dead-end room. Inside the three-sided wall room, there&#8217;s a small treasure chest. And a metal sculpture is guarding that treasure chest. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes a soundーthe moment we set foot in the room. The angel-like sculpture looks at us and starts moving. It kicks the ground. Spreading its wing and flying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ーFast!!? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Cecyl!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「『Spirit, strike my enemies! Flame Arrow』!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A flame arrow springs out from Cecyl&#8217;s hand ーit hits the sculpture and vanishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn&#8217;t work!? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Nagi! Cecyl-chan! Get away!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita pushes us away. The golden sculpture moves in front of her. It raises its sword towards Rita. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Rita!!」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*gain&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sculpture&#8217;s sword hits Rita&#8217;s arm. A solid sound. She barely defends the sword with her【Divine Power Control】. At the same time, Rita launches a kick. The sculpture&#8217;s shield stops the blow. It only shakes faintlyーthis is bad! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I can&#8217;t win against this guy! Everyone retreats!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I start running while carrying Cecyl. I leap into the opened door. Ritaー</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Thiーs thing!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita kicks the sculpture with both legs. She jumps by using the force. Rita flies backward and rolls into the room.I close the door in a hurry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*gain*gain* It hits the door. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, it stops. The sculptureーwhat happened? I open the door slightly. It turns back to the chest butー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;gigigi&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;batan&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I close the door before the sculpture that is looking at this way starts moving. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…It is a【Guardian】.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Guardian…a moving sculpture?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes.It was created by magicians in olden days as it has a trait protecting certain places such as room or mansion. It operates by magical power and eliminates intrudersー or to be precise, it kills them.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl clings to my leg. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Sorry. I was too slow to recall it. I have exposed Nagi-sama to danger…」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「It&#8217;s alright. Rita and I didn&#8217;t get hurt.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This place is the magician&#8217;s refuge, of course, that guy would prepare a 【Guardian】.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That guy said that &#8216;Obtain the cursed sword if you have the power.&#8217; In other words, he prepared that 【Guardian】 to test one&#8217;s strength.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes.There are people who would want the demon&#8217;s legacy here.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita says. I can&#8217;t give up.Cecyl clings to me like that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I agree. Then, what we should do?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Just leave it alone.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now. Because I&#8217;ll think the method to capture it, to fight it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「And then, this place will be a secret between us only.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「AgreedーCecyl-chan?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Ah, yes, of course.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「That&#8217;s why don&#8217;t make such a sad face.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita crouches and wipes the tears on Cecyl&#8217;s eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Since the job is done, how about we return and go to bath, and then we&#8217;ll discuss what we should do next?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「…Yes!!」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cecyl laughs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Cecyl tells the specification of the【Guardian】as follows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Guardian is a sculpture that moves by magical power. It has an eyesight, a sense of smell and hearing of an average animal. Its trait is to protect gates and treasures. Sword and blow damage reduction Resistant to fire magic. Recommendation level, the lowest is 15 and above.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I have Cecyl lock the door with ancient language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the sun has set when we were doing a lot of things, it has been decided that it&#8217;ll be dangerous to return at the moment. While in the basement, I want to see whether the【Guardian】will come out or not for a while but it&#8217;s not moving at all. It seems that the guy only protects the treasure chest. Perhaps, it can&#8217;t come out because the door only reacts to the ancient language. In accordance with the notes left by the magician, that guy is probably just for the sake of『Testing the successor&#8217;s strength』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, we decide to spend the night in the basement while standing guard in turns. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We complete the quest and decide to return to the town. This time, the large bats that were exterminated are 16. I cut the bat&#8217;s ear as a proof for exterminating it and bring them with me exactly as I was told. And the hidden room is sealed by Cecyl&#8217;s 【Ancient Language】, the end. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rita wants to wash her body, by all means, so she goes to the public bath with Cecyl as I go to report to the guild. Since the quest finished earlier than I thought, it&#8217;s probably fine to be the logistic supports for the cursed sword lookup. Because I received a skill orb from Aine-san and she even introduced me the quest secretly.I have to pay the debts. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, I head towards the second floor of the building. There&#8217;s Aine-san. Sleeping on the table of the resting room on the second floor. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A girl wearing expensive-looking clothes decorated with gold thread is sitting beside her. She carries a rapier on her waist. Short blue hair. She has her elbow on the table, propping up his chin while looking at me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Did you finish the quest?」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blue hair girl says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bring out the cloth bag where I put 【Large Bat&#8217;s Ears】in it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Yes.This the proof. Please give me the reward.」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「I can&#8217;t pay you.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl says it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「Common Guild is closed for today.」</span></p>
