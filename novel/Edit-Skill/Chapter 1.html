<h3>Chapter 1: Secretly, Forbidden, Wanting to be Intimate</h3>


<p>Friendship between men and women was a huge lie. The fact that the person who first proposed it remained nameless in history served as evidence. </p>



<p>Those who spout such nonsense were either self-serving, popular girls wanting to keep their options open or guys stuck in the inertia of their own hesitations. Of course, it could be the other way around too.</p>



<p>What I was trying to say, however, was that it’s impossible for a guy like me, Sena Kisumi, at least.</p>



<p>My feelings had grown so strong that I couldn’t deceive myself with baseless words. After serious contemplation, I chose to express my feelings.</p>



<p>Never did I imagine falling in love with her. Maybe it started by chance, but these feelings were undeniably real.</p>



<p>“I like you. Will you go out with me?”</p>



<p>On the last day of my freshman year in high school, I confessed to Arisaka Yoruka. Under the early bloomed cherry blossoms, it was a once-in-a-lifetime gamble.</p>



<p>“You like me, Sena?” Arisaka asked, her surprise bordering on disbelief. </p>



<p>I had chosen a famous confession spot behind the school building, yet she seemed completely unprepared for the current situation.</p>



<p>From the beginning, I was well aware that she and I were not a good match. Arisaka Yoruka, who was beautiful and excellent in everyone’s eyes, was too far apart from the plain and inconspicuous Sena Kisumi. The only thing we had in common was being in the same class.</p>



<p>“Sena, you mean you want to be my boyfriend, right?” Her voice trembled.</p>



<p>“Yes, I seriously, <em>genuinely</em> want to change our relationship to boyfriend-girlfriend if possible.”</p>



<p>However, it seemed my courage fell on deaf ears.</p>



<p>Certainly, the confession was solely for my benefit. She was free to feel however she wanted. I was well aware that Arisaka Yoruka didn’t find the idea of being in a romantic relationship appealing.</p>



<p>Her stunning beauty made her a victim of excessive attention, resulting in a slight mistrust of people. Her everyday life, where she attracted attention everywhere, could be a source of stress, especially when those who were drawn to her appearance confessed and were coldly rejected.</p>



<p>Thanks to her unyielding responses, no one dared to confess to her anymore. </p>



<p>Who could be the fortunate man that a beauty like her could fall for? Honestly, I couldn’t even imagine myself getting a good response from her.</p>



<p>To embark on such a reckless challenge, I must be a fool. There was a significant risk of her not speaking to me until graduation.</p>



<p>But true love didn’t follow logic. If I were calm to begin with, facing someone like Arisaka head-on would be impossible.</p>



<p>“Boyfriend and girlfriend…” Arisaka’s voice was muffled as she covered her mouth with her hand and staggered backward. </p>



<p> Her reaction…. didn’t seem quite right.</p>



<p>“Uhm…. Arisaka?”</p>



<p>“Sena, are you serious? If I say yes, we’re going to be a couple!”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Even when we’re apart, I want to stay in touch, go on dates…”</p>



<p>“And, um, ecchi stuff too?”</p>



<p>Her sudden leap to this question momentarily shattered my nerves.</p>



<p>“To say I’m not interested would be a lie,” I responded promptly, maintaining a serious expression. I couldn’t afford to flinch or smirk awkwardly; it would give off the wrong impression. I meant it.</p>



<p>“Honest one, aren’t you!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/147079.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>“Did you expect any different!?”</p>



<p>“Well, I mean, answering so boldly is unexpected!”</p>



<p>Arisaka, looking far more mature than our age would suggest, hugged her alluring figure. Her delicate limbs, well-proportioned body, a slender waist emphasized to highlight her generous chest and ample hips—her strikingly feminine figure captivated anyone, regardless of gender.</p>



<p>“Hmm, so Sena is interested in me,” Arisaka attempted to keep her usual assertiveness despite her somewhat forced tone.</p>



<p>“Just so you know, I fell for your personality. Don’t get it twisted.”</p>



<p>“I wonder about that.”</p>



<p>“Why’s that?”</p>



<p>“I’m just not cut out for romance; it’d be a struggle for both of us.”</p>



<p>“Arisaka, have you ever have a boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“O-of course not! Baka!” She vehemently denied it.</p>



<p>“Well, you won’t know unless you try. For a guy, the flaws of the girl he likes are just cute points.”</p>



<p>“Mou, you say embarrassing things so casually…”</p>



<p>A gentle breeze drifts by, causing Arisaka’s long hair to sway as cherry blossoms danced around her. Perhaps it was because of that faint pink hue, her cheeks now lightly tinged with red. </p>



<p>Her glossy, lengthy hair cascaded down to her waist, and her snow-white skin seemed to radiate from within like virgin snow. The features on her small, distinctly defined face were striking. A sleek jawline complemented by long, dark eyelashes framed eyes so large they could draw you in.</p>



<p>Yep, Arisaka Yoruka is, without a doubt, an enchanting girl.</p>



<p>“I was already prepared the moment I decided to confess.”</p>



<p>“Prepared?”</p>



<p>“Worst-case scenario, even if you hate me, I wanted you to know my feelings.”</p>



<p>“I-I would never hate you, Sena.” Arisaka was visibly uneasy, perhaps her way of trying to be considerate to me, her classmate for a year. “I see…”</p>



<p>Her words just now probably implied, “<em>Let’s continue being good friends.”</em></p>



<p><em>Oh no</em>. A gloomy emotion slowly seeped in. I struggled to find a clever phrase to fill this silent moment. Arisaka stayed silent too. Just as I began to consider quietly leaving, she uttered words I never expected.</p>



<p>“──This is the first time someone I like has confessed to me.”</p>



<p>…Did I hear that correctly? She indeed said, “someone I like.”</p>



<p>“Arisaka, what did you just say?”</p>



<p>“<em>Mouuuu</em>, I can’t take it anymore!” She suddenly shouted, turning towards the cherry blossom tree. Her slender shoulders trembled.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong, Arisaka? Why are you trembling?”</p>



<p>“This can’t be true, right? Sena actually likes me! Is this even possible? If this is a dream, I don’t want to wake up!”</p>



<p>Flapping both legs, Arisaka lets out a joyful scream, expressing happiness all over her body like a little girl who got her desired present on Christmas morning.</p>



<p>“You’re really excited.”</p>



<p>“Whose fault is that! Take responsibility!”</p>



<p>“Huh? Why am I getting scolded!?”</p>



<p>Arisaka Yoruka alternated between happiness and embarrassment, completely unlike her usual calm demeanor. Then, she turned to me, and her flustered expression eased. She pushed up her reddened cheeks with both hands. Yet, the happiness in her eyes couldn’t be hidden.</p>



<p>“Because, we both like each other! Trying not to get too excited is impossible!”</p>



<p>“Getting excited, huh…”</p>



<p>“Why is your energy so low, Sena? Aren’t you happy?”</p>



<p>“Your reaction caught me off guard. I missed the timing to be thrilled.”</p>



<p>Facing an unexpectedly surreal turn of events, I found myself oddly calm. This couldn’t be some elaborate prank, right?</p>



<p>“How boring! I’m the only one acting like a fool. I was so nervous, you know? I’m still nervous even now!”</p>



<p>Her large eyes, fixed on me, sparkle like jewels with tears of joy. This was one of those moments to share happiness, right? But why was I suddenly being lectured by my overly excited crush?</p>



<p>A bit taken aback, I took a deep breath. Once I confirmed this was indeed reality, I asked, “…Would that be okay? If I release my honest emotions, I might run around like a dog.”</p>



<p>“That’d be annoying. It’d be embarrassing and troublesome if others find out.” </p>



<p>Arisaka regained a hint of composure. As we locked eyes again, we both quickly looked away.</p>



<p>“You know, I do get your feelings, Arisaka, to some extent.”</p>



<p>“To some extent? What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>



<p>“I can clearly see you have a good feeling towards me. But…”</p>



<p>“But?”</p>



<p>“You haven’t given me an answer to my confession yet.”</p>



<p>“I was so happy I completely forgot. Can’t we skip that part?”</p>



<p>“Nope, can’t do. It’s a crucial part.” I wouldn’t budge on this.</p>



<p>“You’re not being nice.”</p>



<p>“If I’m too lenient from the start, it won’t end well!”</p>



<p>“…I’m getting really nervous, though.”</p>



<p>Arisaka, now blushing up to her ears, nervously bit her lower lip. It seemed like she was trying to speak the crucial words, but they wouldn’t come out.</p>



<p>“Arisaka, maybe take a deep breath?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Just a moment,” she said, inhaling and exhaling deeply twice. Her impressive chest rose and fell significantly.</p>



<p>“Have you calmed down?”</p>



<p>“Sena, it’s amazing that you can confess.”</p>



<p>“Thanks for the compliment. How about letting me praise you soon?”</p>



<p>“Don’t act all smug just because you got it done first!”</p>



<p>“Your attempt to hide your embarrassment is strong!  This confession was practically a guaranteed win!”</p>



<p>At this critical moment, she was being remarkably uncooperative. <em>Quit acting defensive and embarrassed like we’re about to fight, your cuteness made it hard not to forgive you.</em></p>



<p>“How long do you think I’ve been harboring these feelings? Six months! A little more patience wouldn’t hurt!”</p>



<p>“…So you’ve liked me for that long. I thought I wasn’t being treated like a man at all.”</p>



<p>That was a shocking revelation. Our mutual crush had been going on for quite a while.</p>



<p>“I-I mean, you’ve been visiting the art prep room every day since before summer. Being alone with a guy makes me super nervous, you know.”</p>



<p>The art prep room, hidden in a corner of the school building, was her secret base with the unspoken approval of the teachers. Except during classes, she spent her time there, and I visited every day to talk with her. Every time I visited, she received me with a grumpy expression. Was that just her nervousness?</p>



<p>“I’m nervous too.”</p>



<p>“It’s impressive you kept showing up every day without giving up. Sena, how much do you even like me?” Arisaka desperately put up a front, trying to assert her dominance.</p>



<p>“I like you a lot. That’s why I’m confessing now.”</p>



<p>“Don’t push it! I’m getting even more nervous!”</p>



<p>“Does my love really have that much impact?”</p>



<p>The sight of a beautiful girl, who had been confessed to countless times, flustered was truly precious.</p>



<p>“Because… Sena is special.” Arisaka confessed the truth as if squeezing out the words. “That’s why I came when you called me.”</p>



<p>Arisaka fidgeted. She seemed to have understood the purpose of this meeting from the beginning.</p>



<p>“Arisaka Yoruka-san, please let me hear your answer.” I slowly prompted the decisive moment.</p>



<p>“Sena…”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“Ugh, I’ve had enough. Sena, let’s continue this next time.”</p>



<p>“Huh, continue? Arisaka!? Arisaka──!!”</p>



<p>While I was bewildered, she ran off from behind the school building.</p>



<p>“Next time… Next time when the new semester starts.”</p>



<p>While I was standing there in shock, I suddenly felt another gaze on me. Looking around, even gazing up at the school building, there was no one. <em>Is it just my imagination?</em></p>



<p>In the midst of the sakura petals dancing in the disorderly spring day, Arisaka, elated by my confession, dashed away without me hearing her definitive answer.</p>



<p>And just like that, we entered the spring break.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">🔹</p>



<p>I spent an incredibly frustrating spring break.</p>



<p>Judging by Arisaka’s reactions, she undeniably liked me. So why postpone giving an answer? A simple “I like you,” could have elevated our relationship to a joyous romance. Then I could have spent spring break in bliss.</p>



<p>“Sigh, this is so tough.”</p>



<p>Left without a response, I fell into an endless cycle of imagination hell. I couldn’t sleep at night, and my emotions were at their peak during this spring break period.</p>



<p>The strange mix of being so close to a romantic relationship with a friend fueled bizarre fantasies in me, while at the same time, I became paranoid, repeatedly inflicting wounds upon myself with baseless worries on my bed.</p>



<p>“…We should have at least exchanged contact info.”</p>



<p>The blank screen of my phone, lacking Arisaka Yoruka’s name, glowed emptily.</p>



<p>Even if I regret it now, it was too late. She hadn’t exchanged contact information with any of her classmates. Of course, I hadn’t either. Even though I had gone to her secret haven, the art prep room, I missed the chance to get her number. Now, all I could do is patiently wait for spring break to end. </p>



<p>It was torture.</p>



<p>Who knew falling in love could make your chest ache so much? After all, I had been single forever, and my lack of experience was glaring. I possessed zero knowledge about the actions one should take in such times or any foresight. It was quite an intense initiation into the harsh reality of love.</p>



<p>I wasn’t originally the type to idolize romance. Even though I held a faint hope of getting a girlfriend one day after entering adolescence, I wasn’t in a hurry. </p>



<p>Therefore, Arisaka undoubtedly changed me.</p>



<p>While the motivation of love could drive actions, it could also become a curse, eating away at one’s self.</p>



<p>Irregular routines have left my complexion in a terrible state, aimlessly wandering the corridors, making occasional outburst in the bathroom, impromptu binge-eating or workouts to the point of sweating—my behavior became suspicious enough to terrify my fourth-grade sister.</p>



<p><em>“Kisumi-kun, you’re acting weird.” </em></p>



<p>And she needed to call me “Onii-chan” properly.</p>



<p>As a result, aside from a few calls from friends, I spent most of spring break cooped up at home. What was supposed to be a short spring break never felt so long.</p>



<p>Then came the first day of the new school year.</p>



<p>I rose before the alarm, swiftly changing into my blazer uniform. After tying the tie haphazardly, I left without breakfast, arriving at school much earlier than usual.</p>



<p>Checking the posted class assignment for second-year students, I gave a triumphant fist pump upon finding myself in the same 2-A class as Arisaka. </p>



<p>In the classroom, as I was eagerly awaiting her arrival, I exchanged casual greetings with familiar faces as they trickled in. However, Arisaka didn’t show up even as my classmates filled the room.</p>



<p>Soon, our homeroom teacher for the year, Kanzaki Shizuru-sensei, entered the room. As if timing it perfectly, Arisaka Yoruka made a last-minute entrance.</p>



<p>The moment Arisaka appeared, the atmosphere in the classroom shifted. Classmates eyed the beautiful girl with an air of anticipation. Arisaka, with her long flowing hair, remained composed, ignoring the envy that poured in from all directions. </p>



<p>Of all the glances directed her way, the most intense undoubtedly came from me. </p>



<p>She didn’t spare a glance in my direction, treating Seina Kisumi as though he had become invisible. Even though she walked past me on her way to her desk, she didn’t attempt to acknowledge my presence. With an even more composed expression than usual, she conspicuously treated my existence like I was non-existent. </p>



<p>“What’s going on?”</p>



<p>Arisaka’s attitude left me bewildered. Something was off. Definitely.</p>



<p>I lifted myself from my seat, attempting to observe her. However, all I could see from this angle was the graceful profile of her face. <em>Nice eyelashes</em>, I noted.</p>



<p>“Sena-san, please face forward. What’s making you so fidgety? Can’t hold it in?” Kanzaki-sensei’s calm voice warned me.</p>



<p>“Various things might come out, and it’s risky.”</p>



<p>“Make sure you don’t embarrass yourself. You’re a second-year in high school starting today.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei was unfazed by my nonchalant reply, and the classmates laughed at our exchange. The only one not laughing was Arisaka. Had I become disliked?</p>



<p>In an attempt to ease my anxiety, I tried interpreting her reaction in a positive light. Maybe she was just shy. Even during the confession, she seemed so nervous that she couldn’t respond immediately. It was reasonable that our first meeting since then would be awkward.</p>



<p>“…But still, she’s ignoring me too much,” I muttered quietly.</p>



<p>Did she know how anxious and uneasy I had been during spring break?</p>



<p>We finally met, but her behavior was so extreme. Perhaps my feelings have been building up all this time, while she simply hasn’t paid me any mind. With Arisaka, it wouldn’t be surprising if she lost interest over spring break and would casually say, “Let’s forget it.”</p>



<p>I was starting to genuinely worry.</p>



<p>“Alright, everyone, let’s proceed to the opening ceremony in the gym.” Sensei announced.</p>



<p>As everyone got up and headed to the corridor, I walked over to Arisaka’s seat. She was the only one who remained seated.</p>



<p>“Arisaka, we’re in the same class again this year. I’m looking forward to it.” I tried to initiate a conversation with a safe topic.</p>



<p>“…I knew.” Her response was curt.</p>



<p>“Huh, how come?”</p>



<p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>



<p>“Arisaka, what’s going on?” My voice rose slightly.</p>



<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>“Nothing? You seem strange…”</p>



<p>As I moved to face Arisaka directly, she turned her head away from me. Even her attempt to appear indifferent and cold only left me awestruck by her beauty. </p>



<p><em>Ah, I’m fascinated by this girl</em>. But the atmosphere wasn’t right for asking about her answer to my confession.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, there were only the two of us left in the classroom. Kanzaki-sensei called from the hallway, “You two, it’s time to go.”</p>



<p>“S-Sorry! We’ll catch up right away!” I replied hastily.</p>



<p>“…Don’t be late,” Kanzaki-sensei said and left it at that.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I couldn’t think of a solution. However, if I missed this opportunity, I felt like I’d never get to hear the response to my confession.</p>



<p>Hey, Arisaka. You were happy about my confession, right? It wasn’t just me, was it?</p>



<p>The sounds of classmates who were crowded in the hallway already faded, perhaps choosing this moment…</p>



<p>“──Sorry for keeping you waiting,” she said, opening her mouth softly.</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>Finally, our eyes met.</p>



<p>“I got too excited back then, and my head was spinning.” Arisaka moved her gaze busily, looking at my face and then shyly averted her eyes. “I regretted not answering you right there. Failing to convey my feelings is so frustrating; I despise myself for it. So, during spring break… even though we share mutual feelings, it was tough.”</p>



<p>Arisaka lowered her eyes slightly and then rallied. “Hey, is the confession still valid?”</p>



<p>She fixed her gaze on me. This time, she didn’t look away, waiting for my reaction.</p>



<p>“O-of course! It’s still valid! Forever valid!” I answered rapidly.</p>



<p>“I’ll give you the answer to the confession now.”</p>



<p>Arisaka looked up at me and said the words I’d been longing to hear.</p>



<p>“I like Sena too. I’ve always liked you. So, I accept your confession. Please let me be your girlfriend.”</p>



<p>If there was one moment that could be considered the happiest in the world, it was when you found out you were going out with the girl you liked. I never expected to have such a moment in my life. Wrapped in the thrill of the unknown, for a moment, I couldn’t move.</p>



<p>“Sena?”</p>



<p>Arisaka’s delicate fingers touched the back of my hand. Perhaps due to nervousness, her hand was cold. Feeling the difference in temperature, I finally came back to my senses.</p>



<p>“────Ah.”</p>



<p>As soon as relief set in, a loud growl emanated from my stomach. We looked at each other and burst into laughter.</p>



<p>“Hey, hold on. Did you just respond to me with a stomach growl? Is that for real? I can’t believe it!” Arisaka clutched her stomach, laughing.</p>



<p>“Well, it can’t be helped! I was so preoccupied with thoughts of you that I skipped breakfast!”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. Then, is your tie crooked because you rushed to tie it?”</p>



<p>Only then did I realize.</p>



<p>“Well, it can’t be helped,” she said as she stood up and reached for my collar. I remained still, letting her do as she pleased. The proximity between us was very close.</p>



<p>“There, all done. How’s that? Not too tight?” Arisaka had perfectly adjusted my tie with exquisite precision.</p>



<p>“It’s perfect.”</p>



<p>“Is it? That’s good.”</p>



<p>“Th-thank you.”</p>



<p>“I don’t like sloppy people.”</p>



<p>“I’ll make sure to pay more attention to my appearance.”</p>



<p>“This time was my fault. I can redo it for you as many times as you want. After all, I’m your girlfriend.” Arisaka smiled triumphantly.</p>



<p><em>Wait, isn’t this cute girl a bit dangerous?</em></p>



<p>“Arisaka.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“I really like you.”</p>



<p>“No surprise attacks allowed! Especially not in public! Absolutely not!”</p>



<p>“Why? I just expressed my feelings.”</p>



<p>“I’m bad with this! Ah, by the way, our relationship must remain a secret to everyone! It’s a promise!”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind, but can I ask why?”</p>



<p>“I’m happy, but it’s embarrassing. I’m still nervous, and this is supposed to be something special between the two of us, right? Acting lovey-dovey in public is gross, and I hate looking like a dumb couple. I don’t want others to notice. It feels uncomfortable to have unrelated people talk about us. Please, can you keep it a secret?”</p>



<p>I couldn’t refuse her request.</p>



<p>“Instead, when we’re alone, we can act as much like a couple as we want, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Wait, what?”</p>



<p>I took a step closer.</p>



<p>“S-Sena, you’re being too assertive all of a sudden!”</p>



<p>“…There’s no one here now, so we can do something couple-like, right?”</p>



<p>“I told you, no sudden moves!” </p>



<p>“I’ve reached my limit,” I whispered.</p>



<p>“Uh, wait! It’s not that I’m not uninterested, but for these things, it’s better to follow the right order and take it step by step…”</p>



<p>I took another step closer to the flustered Arisaka.</p>



<p>“Sena. I, um…”</p>



<p>“──Arisaka, the opening ceremony is starting. We need to go to the gym or we’ll stand out if we’re late.”</p>



<p>I quickly left the classroom.</p>



<p>“S-Sena is unexpectedly mean!” Arisaka also joined me in the hallway.</p>



<p>“Spring break’s aftereffect. Forgive me.”</p>



<p>“I answered properly, though.”</p>



<p>“Don’t sulk. Should I have kissed you right there? Was that what you wanted?”</p>



<p>“You’re the one who’s eager!” Arisaka lined up beside me and attempted to pass me.</p>



<p>“Don’t run in the hallway.”</p>



<p>“My legs are longer than most people’s.”</p>



<p>“I know.”</p>



<p>“Pervert. You were totally staring at my legs.”</p>



<p>“More like a different part.”</p>



<p>“Huh, where?”</p>



<p>“Secret. If I say it, you’ll get embarrassed again.”</p>



<p>“Pervy Sena.”</p>



<p>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p>



<p>We raced down the empty corridor, heading towards the gymnasium. We returned to a state where we could chat comfortably.</p>



<p>However, we were no longer just friends. We had become lovers.</p>
