<h3>Chapter 9: Oh, My Troubles, Please Settle Down!?</h3>

<p>After school, as Yorka and I headed to our usual family restaurant, rain began to pour down. The raindrops were relentless, and neither of us had thought to bring an umbrella.</p>



<p>“Too bad we can’t share an umbrella together.”</p>



<p>“Enough with idle chatter; we’ll catch a cold.”</p>



<p>In a hurry, we sought refuge under the eaves of a nearby small diner. Both of us were drenched in our school uniforms.</p>



<p>“How are your ankles holding up?”</p>



<p>“You worry too much. It’s just a mild sprain; I’m already fine.” I lightly jumped on the spot, showcasing my swift recovery.</p>



<p>“Hey! You’re splashing water everywhere!”<br />Yorka laughed, playfully hitting my arm.</p>



<p>“I should have brought a towel or something.”</p>



<p>I rummaged through my bag and pockets. However, not even a handkerchief was in sight.</p>



<p>“You’re so careless. At least carry a handkerchief,” Yorka scolded, using her own to wipe my wet hair and face.</p>



<p>“I’m fine, really.”</p>



<p>“Colds don’t discriminate between men and women when you’re soaked, you know.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s hand didn’t stop. With her wet hair, she had a certain allure, creating a slightly different impression than usual.</p>



<p>Since that sports festival, Arisaka Yorka had changed a bit. The awkwardness had eased, and the sense of distance when we were together had become closer. In the early days of our relationship, she seemed overly conscious of me, tense and nervous. Now, it felt like she had relaxed, enjoying our time together.</p>



<p>I also perceived a change in the way our classmates looked at her. The catalyst was the cheering during that basketball game. The aura of ‘stay away’ that she used to emit seemed to have softened after that incident.</p>



<p>While she still didn’t engage much with other classmates, if Miyachi approached, she would respond briefly.</p>



<p>“What should we do after this?”</p>



<p>“The rain doesn’t seem to be letting up. We should find somewhere to rest,” I replied, contemplating the options.</p>



<p>Whether we returned to school or headed to the station, the distance wasn’t significantly different. Being drenched would only make us cold, and even in mid-April, rain brought a chill to the air. I wanted to dry my hair and uniform, and the thought of an umbrella or a warm drink crossed my mind.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I glanced at Yorka, whose face had inexplicably turned bright red.</p>



<p>“──Rest? Are you planning to take me somewhere weird!?”</p>



<p>“…No! That’s not it! I just genuinely want to rest, not in some hotel or strange place!” I hurriedly clarified, not having considered anything like that.</p>



<p>“By the way, Yorka, you know about love hotels and such?”</p>



<p>For some reason, I felt most unsettled realizing she understood those kinds of places.</p>



<p>“Sena is naughty…”</p>



<p>“Knowing about places for naughty stuff puts you in the same category, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“That’s because my sister randomly talks about it!”</p>



<p>“Is your erotic knowledge passed down directly from your sister?”</p>



<p>“Don’t call it erotic knowledge. It’s part of health education.”</p>



<p>“Health education mostly covers the final stages, not the initial steps like romantic relationships.”</p>



<p>In an era where communication skills were overly emphasized, why not teach the proper way of love and communication between genders at school? Why leave crucial aspects that could impact one’s life entirely to the discretion of students? I refused this self-responsibility!</p>



<p>I let my thoughts wander into these distractions, but my pounding heart wasn’t easily calmed. Only the sound of rain echoed.</p>



<p>Thanks to Yorka, my awareness had taken an odd turn and I struggled to find the next words. Despite being wet and cold from the rain, my ears strangely felt warm.</p>



<p>In the proximity that seemed like our shoulders might touch, we remained silent, lost in contemplation between the practical issues ahead and perhaps, the swirling fantasies in our minds.</p>



<p>A cute sneeze snapped me back to reality.</p>



<p>“──Alright!” I raised my voice with determination.</p>



<p>Yorka’s shoulders twitched in surprise.</p>



<p>“Yorka.”</p>



<p>“W-What?”</p>



<p>“Come with me.”</p>



<p>“Where to?”</p>



<p>“My place.”</p>



<p>“Huh? You mean your house?”</p>



<p>“Where else would it be?”</p>



<p>“Is that… okay?”</p>



<p>“At my place, you can dry off comfortably, and I can lend you an umbrella.”</p>



<p>I carefully framed my words, attempting to wipe away any suspicious implications.</p>



<p>“If that’s okay with you, I’d appreciate it…” Yorka nodded faintly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>My house was within walking distance from the school. Though I had thought about inviting Yorka over at some point in our relationship, I hadn’t expected it to happen so soon.</p>



<p>Running through the pouring rain, we headed towards my home. A two-story house with a small garden and a parking space.</p>



<p>I hastily unlocked the front door and stepped inside.</p>



<p>“For now, let’s head to the bathroom to dry our hair and uniforms,” I suggested, taking off my shoes and walking up the hallway.</p>



<p>“But if we go like this, we’ll wet the hallway.” Yorka was dripping with water and seemed hesitant.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it since it’s already wet because of me. Come in.” I forcefully pulled her hand.</p>



<p>“Uh, excuse me!” Yorka politely greeted even though there was no one around.</p>



<p>We continued down the hallway together while enduring the discomfort of wet socks.</p>



<p>“I’m going to get the bath towels──”</p>



<p>Without bothering to knock, I swung open the door to the bathroom, which also served as a changing room.</p>



<p>Inside stood a completely naked girl who had just finished bathing.</p>



<p>Though tall, her face exuded youthfulness. Her slender body resembled thin limbs, yet her body possessed distinctly feminine curves.</p>



<p>“Whoa!” I quickly slammed the door shut.</p>



<p>“…Kisumi ~ There was someone just now, right?”</p>



<p>“I-I think you might be imagining things.”</p>



<p>“A girl was there, naked.”</p>



<p>“That was… well, it was completely unexpected for me too.”</p>



<p>As I stammered, the door swung open on its own.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kisumi-kun’s back! Welcome home!”</p>



<p>The girl, wrapped in only one bath towel, greeted me with an innocent smile.</p>



<p>“It’s not ‘welcome home’! Could you at least lock the door!?”</p>



<p>“Ahaha. Oops, I forgot.”</p>



<p>“Ugh, this is the worst!”</p>



<p>I racked my brain on how to smoothly explain this bizarre situation.</p>



<p>“Don’t be mad. Oh, the bath is free now.”</p>



<p>Her nonchalant attitude, completely unfazed by the awkward encounter, left me flabbergasted. Learn a bit of modesty, for goodness’ sake.</p>



<p>“Put some clothes on right now!”</p>



<p>“Aw, but it’s hot wearing clothes right after a bath.”</p>



<p>“I’ve told you countless times not to roam around in just a towel!”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, you’re extra scary today.”</p>



<p>My persistent warnings fell on deaf ears. This was getting troublesome.</p>



<p>“──So, that’s how it is.”</p>



<p>Yorka, who had maintained an eerie silence, murmured with a voice I’d never heard before, tinged with sadness.</p>



<p>“W-w-wait, did you really understand? I haven’t explained anything yet!” I stammered, fearfully turning to face my girlfriend.</p>



<p>There stood the God of Hell.</p>



<p>“You invite me over, and then you introduce me to your naked affair partner? What kind of sick hobby is this?! You pervert! The worst kind of guy! Cheater!”</p>



<p>Yorka was furious.</p>



<p>“Hold on! It’s a misunderstanding! Everything was an unforeseen accident, and, for the record, she’s not some suspicious girl! Just calm down! We can talk about it!”</p>



<p>“This ‘someone,’ seems quite close with you.”</p>



<p>“We live together; of course, we’re close!”</p>



<p>“Oh, cohabiting even. So you’ve gotten used to seeing each other naked?”</p>



<p>Uh-oh. Her tone was ice-cold.</p>



<p>“She’s not what you think! She’s—” I vehemently denied.</p>



<p>“A girl who casually calls you ‘Kisumi-kun’ isn’t someone trustworthy!”</p>



<p>Yorka, losing her temper, turned the Sena household into a sudden hell. Clearly, it was an anger related to Asaki-san, but Yorka entirely and spectacularly misunderstood the situation.</p>



<p>“Calm down and listen! This is my sister who’s still in elementary school!”</p>



<p>“…Oh,” She sneered, “Sister. A sister, huh? A sister, hmm.”</p>



<p>Yorka eerily repeated the same word three times.</p>



<p>“Yeah, my sister! Do you get it now?”</p>



<p>“Having to resort to ‘sister.’ Try coming up with a better excuse!”</p>



<p>“It’s true! She’s my real sister! We’re blood-related!”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/147083.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>Confronted with a stunning beauty seething with anger, my fourth-grade sister trembled in fear, seeking refuge behind me.</p>



<p>“Ei, it’s okay. She’s my classmate, and well, my girlfriend,” I said, blushing as I introduced Arisaka Yorka to my sister.</p>



<p>“No way!? Kisumi-kun, you got a girlfriend! And such a gorgeous one! Amazing!”</p>



<p>Her innocent eyes lit up, and she jumped up and down happily with only a bath towel wrapped around her half-naked appearance. It’s dangerous. Stop jumping!</p>



<p>“Heh… quite the versatile gal, huh? Seriously, her reactions are like that of an elementary school kid.”</p>



<p>Though Yorka’s demeanor softened momentarily, there was still some doubt. I suddenly struck by an idea and rummaged through the washing machine before pulling out a gym uniform.</p>



<p>Emblazoned across the chest was the unmistakable “4-2 Sena Ei.”</p>



<p>“There, believe me now?”</p>



<p>“──I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>In a rare moment, Yorka apologized sincerely.</p>


<p>Kisumi’s younger sister, Ei-chan, proved to be refreshingly nonchalant and saved the day.</p>



<p>“Why is Kisumi-kun’s girlfriend so stunning? Are you a celebrity? A model?” Ei-chan’s eyes sparkled with genuine interest.</p>



<p>Honestly, meeting my boyfriend’s family like this was totally unexpected. Despite Ei-chan being only ten, she looked nothing like a fourth-grader. If she dressed in elegant clothes and used makeup, she would appear almost as mature as an adult.</p>



<p>“Elementary kids these days look so grown-up,” I muttered in disbelief, earning a bemused look from Kisumi.</p>



<p>“Of all people, you say that.”</p>



<p>Following Ei-chan’s suggestion, I borrowed the Sena family’s bath. After an embarrassing misunderstanding, I was soaking in a tub filled with warm water.</p>



<p>“I’m naked in the bathroom at my boyfriend’s house.”</p>



<p>It felt kind of strange.</p>



<p>I was relaxing in an unfamiliar place with no clothes on. The shower and the tub had different designs, and the shampoo, conditioner, and soap were from brands I had never used before.</p>



<p>“Does Kisumi bathe here every day?”</p>



<p>Suddenly imagining that scenario, I realized the absurdity of my current situation. Honestly, having Ei-chan around was a relief. If it were just Kisumi and me, what would happen next?</p>



<p>Despite spending only a brief time in the hot water, my body felt unusually warm. What should I do? How should I face Kisumi when I leave the bath? Oddly enough, my usually sharp mind was fuzzy and indecisive.</p>



<p>“This is bad, I’m getting dizzy.”</p>



<p>I emerged from the tub. Although I often enjoyed long baths, it was just too much today.</p>



<p>“Anyway, act normal. Just be yourself.”</p>



<p>As I repeated this mantra, memories of Kisumi saying I wasn’t ordinary flashed, leaving my thoughts in disarray. My slightly dizzy mind wasn’t trustworthy anymore.</p>



<p>I swung open the bathroom door.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Kisumi was in the washroom. Oh, right, I completely forgot to lock it due to my nervousness.</p>



<p>“────!!”</p>



<p>“…………”</p>



<p>This was the first time I saw Kisumi in casual clothes. Somehow, it felt fresh—simple yet surprisingly good. He looked great in it. If we ever went on a date on a day off, what should I wear?</p>



<p>“S-sorry. I just came to return the hairdryer my sister took to dry her hair. Yorka, you’ve got long hair too, so it’s inconvenient without a dryer, right? I didn’t expect you to finish bathing so quickly, so, um…”</p>



<p>Kisumi, drowning in excuses, placed the dryer next to the sink and quickly left.</p>



<p>Alright, my reality escape was over. Here we go.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>I stepped into the hallway, making sure to close the washroom door firmly.</p>



<p>Immediately, a scream, akin to tearing silk, could be heard from inside.</p>



<p>“───No, this situation is definitely bad.”</p>



<p>I slumped onto the hallway floor.</p>



<p>Sure, it was my fault for entering the washroom. But I thought returning the hair dryer would be quick. Besides, with the bath ready, Yorka wouldn’t come out for a while. However, she showed up…</p>



<p>Just having a girl I liked at my house was nerve-wracking enough, but this was the final blow. I witnessed something incredible. I instinctively covered my face with my hands.</p>



<p><em>Sorry for seeing that</em>. <em>But also</em>, <em>thank you</em>.</p>



<p>“Ah, I still like her. Really, really like her. It’s impossible. I like her so much it hurts.”</p>



<p>I strongly reaffirmed my feelings.</p>



<p>The destructive power was on a whole different level. From getting soaked in the rain to the unexpected invitation to my house, the tension was already maxed out. And now this unexpected encounter in the bathroom.</p>



<p>I’m like the protagonist of a romantic comedy!</p>



<p>Spontaneous and embarrassing mishaps were chaining themselves together, and it was getting scary. It felt like I was recklessly depleting luck, lifespan, and other important things at an alarming rate.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun? What are you doing in the hallway? Playing hide-and-seek by yourself?”</p>



<p>My innocent little sister popped in to check on me.</p>



<p>“My dear sister, why don’t you call me Niichan?”</p>



<p>“Uh, Ei doesn’t know English.”</p>



<p>It seemed my sister’s intelligence didn’t grow as fast as her body.</p>



<p>“How about calling me Niichan from now on?”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun is Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>My ten-year-old sister might not fully grasp the complexities of my situation.</p>



<p>“…Right. Ei is Ei, too,” I said, ruffling her hair.</p>



<p>Despite everything, having Ei at home was a relief. Honestly, who knows what might have happened if it were just Yorka and me alone?</p>



<p>“By the way, Kisumi-kun, what’s for dinner tonight?”</p>



<p>“Ask Mom.”</p>



<p>“Today, both Mom and Dad aren’t here. They said they’re going to Grandpa’s and staying overnight, so dinner is all up to you, Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>I totally forgot!! Were my parents really not coming back tonight? This was risky, seriously risky.</p>



<p>Inviting a girl over and then dropping the bomb, “My parents won’t be home tonight,” was a classic rom-com twist. I couldn’t believe I was facing such a cliche.</p>



<p>Impossible. My heart was pounding with anxiety. I might actually die from real nerves.</p>



<p>It was pouring outside, and with everything going on, we might end up with a sleepover scenario. Though I was interested, reason prevailed for now. It was still too early.</p>



<p>But after that direct peek, my fantasies had become vivid. I wasn’t prepared for this.</p>



<p>If it happened, should I run to the convenience store?</p>



<p>…No, don’t go. I’d probably end up going anyway.</p>



<p>“Ei. Listen, it’s crucial Yorka doesn’t find out that our parents won’t be home tonight. It’s our little secret, okay?”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, you look kinda scary.”</p>



<p>“Please, just keep it quiet.”</p>



<p>“I don’t really get it, but if you get me Haagen-Dazs, I’m cool with it.”</p>



<p>“Geez. Fine, Let’s settle for that.”</p>



<p>This brat, acting all refined despite being in elementary school and only appreciated high-quality ice cream.</p>



<p>After setting up tea and snacks in the living room, Yorka walked in.</p>



<p>“Oh, you have changed,” I maintained composure, fully embracing the role of a host welcoming a guest.</p>



<p>“Yeah, a bit big, though.”</p>



<p>Yorka was wearing my oversized T-shirt and shorts. The neckline was quite loose, revealing her collarbone. Surprisingly, the chest area was tight. Well, with that size, even men’s clothing would feel cramped. The shorts didn’t seem to have much room for her rear either.</p>



<p>I sensed her good figure even with the school uniform, but now the overwhelming volume became more vivid.</p>



<p>──My inner turmoil, please calm down!?</p>



<p>Her hands peeking out from the overly long sleeves were kind of cute. Although those were my clothes, why was it that when girls wear men’s clothes, it automatically added to their charm?</p>



<p>The surreal feeling of having a lover in my living space filled me. My heart was overflowing.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, put three sugars in Ei’s tea,” Ei directed me as usual.</p>



<p>Due to our age-gap, Ei had been relying on me since she was small, turning her into a bit of a spoiled child.</p>



<p>Well, I’d let it slide today. Ei needed to keep Yorka company.</p>



<p>“There you go, be careful not to burn yourself,” I said, placing the tea in front of my sister.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, aren’t you going to join us for a drink?”</p>



<p>“I’ve got to prepare dinner, you know.”</p>



<p>“Oh, come on, let’s chat together. The three of us.”</p>



<p>“Your stomach is rumbling, Ei. Can you endure the late dinner?”</p>



<p>“Then let’s order pizza!”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind if you treat us. Should we use your New Year’s money, perhaps?”</p>



<p>“No way! Kisumi-kun, you’re treating.”</p>



<p>The financial situation of a high schooler without a part-time job was pretty self-evident. Ordering food like pizza wasn’t exactly budget-friendly.</p>



<p>“Don’t be too extravagant.”</p>



<p>“You’re so stingy!”</p>



<p>This massive little sister only matched her age when it came to her tantrums.</p>



<p>“You two seem close,” Yorka remarked, watching our sibling banter with amusement. “Should I treat you two since I’ve borrowed the bath?”</p>



<p>“Yay! Yorka-chan, you’re so kind!”</p>



<p>“No! I can’t let our guest do that, and it’s not good for her education either!” I firmly rejected the idea.</p>



<p>“Surprisingly strict, huh?”</p>



<p>“He’s always like this.”</p>



<p>“Aw, so mean.”</p>



<p>“Exactly.”</p>



<p>Yorka and Ei huddled together and exchanged whispers.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t conspire over there. My position might be at risk.”</p>



<p>For some reason, I felt like it would be very inconvenient for me if these two formed an alliance. Nevertheless, they’re surprisingly getting along better than I expected.</p>



<p>“You don’t seem shy around Ei, huh?”</p>



<p>“Well, you see,” Yorka gazed intently at Ei’s face. “…She’s your sister, and I want to get along with her.”</p>



<p>Then she looked at me.</p>



<p>“Feel free to use her as communication training.”</p>



<p>I pretended to ponder over dinner options, turning my back to them as I opened the fridge. Of course, I didn’t want them to see the smile on my face.</p>



<p>Wait, was she talking about our future together? Like, how she would become Sena Yorka eventually? Childish fantasies were flooding my mind.</p>



<p>Calm down, Sena Kisumi. Jumping ahead like this won’t get you anywhere.</p>



<p>“How long are you going to leave the fridge open?” Yorka’s voice suddenly rang in my ear.</p>



<p>Before I realized it, Yoruka was standing beside me.</p>



<p>“Oh, there’s ground meat. Shall I make hamburgers?”</p>



<p>“Is that okay with you?”</p>



<p>“I’ll be cooking my own meals when I get home anyway. Consider it a thank-you for today. Let me do it.”</p>



<p>“Well, if it’s not too much trouble, go ahead.”</p>



<p>“Great. Leave it to me!” Yorka spoke eagerly as I handed her an apron.</p>
