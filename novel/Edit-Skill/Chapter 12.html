<h3>Chapter 12: What I Want the Most</h3>


<p>Miyachi said, “Leave it to me,” and told me to wait in the classroom.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. If Miyauchi says she’ll handle it, let’s trust her,” Nanamura reassured me before heading to the club activities.</p>



<p>I must have looked quite uneasy.</p>



<p>“No, I’m not worried about Miyachi. It’s something else.”</p>



<p>I placed my full trust in Miyauchi Hinaka. She’s that exceptional. If Arisaka Yorka wasn’t at Eisei High, I might be leading a different high school life.</p>



<p>“Anything else on your mind?”</p>



<p>“Well, there’s something bothering me a bit.”</p>



<p>I headed to the faculty room.</p>



<p>In the student counseling room within the faculty room, I confronted Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“What’s the matter, Sena-san?” The unreadable, typically composed Japanese beauty responded as if nothing was amiss.</p>



<p>“Pretending not to know, huh? It’s about Arisaka.”</p>



<p>“The morning rumors?”</p>



<p>“You must be aware, naturally.”</p>



<p>“It’s unavoidable that such things reach my ears.”</p>



<p>“When did you find out?”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei didn’t immediately answer my question.</p>



<p>“Is that important?”</p>



<p>“It is. Clarifying how this rumor spread this time is important.”</p>



<p>“That’s an odd way to put it. Is it not about who witnessed it, but how it spread?”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei seemed to see through my intentions.</p>



<p>“On Saturday, during the tea ceremony club’s activity. On the way to school, someone from the club witnessed Arisaka. Considering it’s gossip about Arisaka Yorka, a beauty well-known within the school, girls would naturally be curious. It likely spread like wildfire within the club in an instant, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“First of all, I have a question. Even if Arisaka-san was truly spotted at the station on Saturday morning, can we conclusively assume that she spent the night outside? That’s an excessive assumption,” Kanzaki-sensei expressed an objective opinion from her position as a teacher.</p>



<p>“I’d like to agree if I could, but it’s impossible.”</p>



<p>“Why? There shouldn’t be any photos.”</p>



<p>“Because the rumor is true. I’m dating Arisaka Yorka. That day, she stayed over at my place.”</p>



<p>“…As a teacher, I can’t overlook that statement.”</p>



<p>Her expression finally changed.</p>



<p>“Of course, I’m confessing on purpose. There’s nothing for you to worry about, Sensei. She couldn’t go home due to heavy rain, that’s all. And the next morning, I took her to the station in casual clothes. Well, regardless of the facts, it’s just circumstantial evidence. It’s more than enough to cause a misunderstanding. After all, to others, the truth can be fabricated quite easily.”</p>



<p>I spoke confidently, almost defiantly.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei must had found my demeanor perplexing. She stared at me intently.</p>



<p>“Sena-san, what are you trying to say?”</p>



<p>“Why did you allow the rumor to spread?” My voice naturally carried a hint of hostility, a flip side to my trust in her.</p>



<p>──Why didn’t the teacher stop it?</p>



<p>“The way the rumors spread this time was too fast.”</p>



<p>I asserted.</p>



<p>“If you had reprimanded them, the girls in the tea ceremony club would have obediently followed. It’s because they have trust and respect for you that our tea ceremony club boasts an unusual popularity and size among cultural clubs. This incident is clearly uncharacteristic of the tea ceremony club. If you had paid more attention, this rumor would have spread more gradually. Yet, in just two days, the entire school knew about Arisaka’s morning return.”</p>



<p>One could not control what people said. Sooner or later, it would have become widely known.</p>



<p>Even so, for the news to spread so quickly throughout the school was impossible unless the tea ceremony club, where influential figures gathered, was the source of the rumor.</p>



<p>“You seem to be overestimating me quite a bit, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>My deductions seemed to hit the mark as a subtle smile played on Kanzaki-sensei’s lips.</p>



<p>“─Of course, I sternly warned the tea ceremony club members against spreading such inappropriate rumors. However, not everyone adheres to that. By the time I heard the rumor, it seemed to have already circulated among a number of students. In any case, this is the result of that.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei responded, a genuine hint of regret in her voice.</p>



<p>“I was inexperienced as a teacher. If only I had more authority, I might have been able to protect Arisaka-san…”</p>



<p>This person genuinely cared about the students. That’s why I couldn’t dislike her.</p>



<p>Last year, when I ended up quitting the basketball club, she advocated for me until the end. When my withdrawal from the club couldn’t be overturned, she sincerely apologized to me.</p>



<p>Handling everything smoothly was challenging for an adult. As excellent as Kanzaki-sensei was, she’s still a young woman in her twenties. It was difficult to manage spirited high school students perfectly.</p>



<p>Perhaps all the tea ceremony club members indeed followed what Kanzaki-sensei said. However, if the rumor had already spread to other students, it would inevitably circulate as a topic, with those spreading it unaware of any potential harm or imagining someone might feel upset.</p>



<p>“I apologize. I might have spoken out of turn.”</p>



<p>“As her boyfriend, it’s only natural to worry about her. That’s just the kind of person you are. Maybe that’s how you won Arisaka-san’s heart.”</p>



<p>“The cupid is you, Sensei.”</p>



<p>“I thought you’d be a good conversation partner for her, but I never expected you to become her lover. Even her older sister was surprised.”</p>



<p>“…Why would Arisaka’s sister be involved in this?”</p>



<p>The unexpected mention of her sister made me tense up.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san’s older sister is an alumna of this school. She was also a student in the first class I ever taught. We maintained contact even after her graduation.Then, at one point, Arisaka-san’s sister asked me, ‘My sister is enrolling. Could you lend her your support?’”</p>



<p>“So, that’s why you let Arisaka use the art prep room.”</p>



<p>“When I heard about this incident, I immediately contacted Arisaka-san’s sister. She’s usually busy with her studies, but on that rainy Friday, she happened to be at home, so she was aware of Arisaka-san’s overnight stay.”</p>



<p>After deciding to stay at my place, Yorka didn’t reach out to her family.</p>



<p>“That confirms the rumor.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei was the first to know that the rumor was true. It was no wonder she couldn’t act recklessly.</p>



<p>“…Initially, I thought Arisaka-san could gradually expand her social circle through interactions with you.”</p>



<p>“You made me play a big role and talked about being a bridge so casually.”</p>



<p>“I couldn’t imagine anyone else but you getting along well with Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“Sensei, it’s okay. I’m hopelessly in love with Arisaka. No matter what others say, I have no intention of breaking up with her,” I declared confidently in front of the teacher.</p>



<p>To someone who had seen students off every year, my statement might sound exceptionally childish. But for me, the present was everything, and if I didn’t give it my all now, I’d regret it for the rest of my life. That much was clear to me.</p>



<p>“Save the bragging for elsewhere,” Kanzaki-sensei chuckled.</p>



<p>“Sensei, the reward you promised when I took on the role of class rep this year, the one about lending a hand in times of trouble… Well, I’m using it right now. Please help smooth things over a bit. I’ll protect Yorka.”</p>



<p>“…I’ll handle it properly this time.”</p>


<p>I returned to the classroom of Class 2-A. Yorka wasn’t there.</p>



<p>While staring absentmindedly at the schoolyard from the window, I contemplated what laid ahead.</p>



<p>How did one put an end to the intangible phenomenon known as rumors?</p>



<p>There was also the unilateral breakup that Yorka threw at me. Even though I trusted Miyachi’s support, it would be meaningless if I couldn’t reconcile with Yorka in the end.</p>



<p>Despite acting high and mighty in front of Kanzaki-sensei, I couldn’t think of any brilliant solutions to break through the current situation. The more I thought about it, the more my spirits sank.</p>



<p>Miyachi and Nanamura were considerate of me. Kanzaki-sensei was also working to resolve the situation in the best possible way. But when I was alone, the bravado had its limits.</p>



<p>My heart ached as I was rereading Yorka’s message on LINE. Has my beloved girlfriend really dumped me? Being alone like this made putting on a front impossible.</p>



<p>The stronger my feelings for Yorka, the greater the pain in my heart.</p>



<p>“Returning to being just friends seems difficult…”</p>



<p>It was such a fleeting spring—a romance that didn’t even last a month.</p>



<p>A confession filled with the resolve to shatter beneath the cherry blossom tree. After becoming an actual couple, feeling her warmth left an unforgettable, precious memory. Each moment was sincere, which was precisely why it transformed into a piercing pain.</p>



<p>──Confessions and pain were always two sides of the same coin.</p>



<p>It was naturally painful to be rejected. Yet, even if things went well and you started dating, the pain of separation awaits sooner or later.</p>



<p>When I confessed, I could only imagine up to the point of being in a relationship. I hadn’t given thought to what came after.</p>



<p>For someone with years of singledom equating to relationship inexperience, my first girlfriend also meant my first heartbreak. It felt like a hole had opened up in my chest, an air passage that would never be filled.</p>



<p>“Men and women can be just friends, huh? That’s a big lie.”</p>



<p>Leaning against the window, I unexpectedly muttered something sentimental.</p>



<p>In the distance, the wind ensemble’s music could be heard, and on the grounds, the sound of the baseball club’s hits echoed.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kisumi-kun? You’re still here?”</p>



<p>Hasekura Asaki appeared in the classroom.</p>



<p>“Asaki-san, you haven’t gone home yet?”</p>



<p>“I came to pick up something I forgot. I was chatting in another class until just now, and everyone was talking about Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“I see,” I could only muster a lackluster response.</p>



<p>“…If you have any worries, I said before that I’ll be here to help. Are you okay?” Asaki-san approached.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m fine.”</p>



<p>“Don’t push yourself. You look really worn out.”</p>



<p>“Do I?”</p>



<p>“Because I know Kisumi-kun is a considerate and kind person,” Asaki-san smiled, revealing her white teeth and encouraged me with a warm smile.</p>



<p>“…Even if you compliment me out of the blue, you won’t get anything,” I managed a dry smile.</p>



<p>“That’s fine. For me, Kisumi-kun is like a prize.”</p>



<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun, want to go out with me?”</p>



<p>Out of nowhere, Asaki-san’s hand touched mine.</p>



<p>“…Wait, what?”</p>



<p>“I’m asking if you want to be my boyfriend.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san made it clear, making sure I couldn’t escape. It sounded somewhat playful, but her gaze was sincere.</p>



<p>“Asaki-san, there are plenty of other guys who would suit you better. I’m just—”</p>



<p>“You’re getting along well with a girl who’s considered out of your league.” She cut off my words sharply.</p>



<p>It was obviously a joking confession, but she was adamant about not letting the topic slide. Seems like I couldn’t brush it off with vague responses.</p>



<p>“──Because you don’t like me that way.” I said with a serious expression.</p>



<p>I wasn’t eager to be blunt since we were both class reps, and it might strain our relationship. Still, her confession wouldn’t make me waver in my feelings for Yorka.</p>



<p>“That’s harsh. To think you saw me like that…”</p>



<p>“If you plan to go against Arisaka, there is no point in doing this.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“I got dumped during lunch break.”</p>



<p>My mind wasn’t working well, and I unintentionally blurted it out.</p>



<p>Asaki-san probably set up this farce driven by rivalry with Yorka. Once she realized I was useless, she’d likely throw some complaints or harsh words my way. And that’d be the end of it.</p>



<p>Today was thoroughly an unlucky day. Resigned to that fact, I waited for her next words.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s even more convenient. Let’s date normally then.”</p>



<p>“Wait… why the sudden confession?”</p>



<p>I was genuinely surprised and accidentally raised my voice. “No, no, considering the flow of our conversation, the expected response would be to lose interest, insult me, leave the classroom dramatically, or at least make a witty joke and exit with style. Why go for a confession? Are you in your right mind?”</p>



<p>“I told you, I’m shocked because you didn’t notice my feelings. I genuinely like you, Kisumi-kun. Being with you is easy and fun. Isn’t that the best?”</p>



<p><em>Whoa</em>, she was confessing her feelings with a surprisingly valid reason. This scenario wasn’t something I had anticipated at all.</p>



<p>“Or maybe you dislike me?”</p>



<p>“You’re a good partner, as a class rep.”</p>



<p>“Then being lovers shouldn’t be a problem. Yeah, it’d work out fine.”</p>



<p>“W-What about the priority of love? Wasn’t it supposed to be low?”</p>



<p>“I’m interested in you enough to change the priority. Kisumi-kun, you’re that intriguing to me.”</p>



<p>A straight pitch. She was resolute.</p>



<p>“Um, Asaki-san, is this really your character? Shouldn’t you keep a better distance and—”</p>



<p>“Why bother holding back in love? It’s easier to be yourself with someone you like. Of course, I want to win against Arisaka-san, but separately, I want to get closer to you, Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite the youthfulness.”</p>



<p>“Don’t just stand there fascinated like it’s someone else’s business. Give me an answer. Yes, or yes.”</p>



<p>“It’s practically one choice!”</p>



<p>“You got dumped, right? I’ll comfort you.”</p>



<p>As if saying ‘bring it on,’ Asaki-san spread her arms wide, fully prepared for a hug.</p>



<p>“No, no, no!”</p>



<p>“You’re stubborn. Well, I can’t match Arisaka-san in the chest department, but my figure is above average, you know.”</p>



<p>“It’s not about the chest size! Isn’t this a bit too convenient for a rom-com development?”</p>



<p>“Approaching someone when they’re heartbroken is the most effective timing.”</p>



<p>“Even if you say that so nonchalantly…”</p>



<p>“In real life, if you strategize, the timing can become perfect, just like in a rom-com.”</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s a maternal instinct. After all, Kisumi-kun, you’re really hurting right now, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“────!!”</p>



<p>She hit the nail on the head, and I was left speechless.</p>



<p>Because it was true. The gap between Yorka and me in this love was too vast from the beginning. No matter how much I felt for her, she easily broke up with me in just one message. She probably sent it impulsively. That much was expected.</p>



<p>─Still, being told “let’s break up” by someone you loved so much hurts precisely because it was genuine. Even if I could understand it in my head, my heart couldn’t accept it.</p>



<p>I didn’t want to break up with Yorka. I wanted to spend more enjoyable time together. I wanted to know her even deeper. I wanted to stay by her side forever.</p>



<p>“Asaki-san, I—”</p>



<p>“What are you doing?”</p>



<p>Before I could finish my sentence, I turned around.</p>



<p>There was Yorka.</p>



<p>“Yor… ka?”</p>



<p>She appeared at the worst possible moment. I was perplexed, unsure of how to handle this situation. However, Yorka ignored me and stood in front of Asaki-san.</p>



<p>“Do you like Kisumi?”</p>



<p>“And if I do? You broke up with Kisumi-kun, right? He doesn’t matter anymore to you, does he?”</p>



<p>Asaki-san, the communication expert, remained unfazed. Yorka had picked a tough opponent if she wanted to challenge her.</p>



<p>“─I haven’t received it.”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“I haven’t received an answer from Kisumi about accepting the breakup! Therefore, we’re still a couple! We haven’t broken up!”</p>



<p>Yorka asserted with astonishing stunt. Asaki-san, taken aback, gave a wry smile and said, “Kisumi-kun said he got dumped, though.”</p>



<p>“I haven’t heard an answer from Kisumi. So, we’re still lovers!”</p>



<p>“You’re making quite an unreasonable claim, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“You don’t know anything!”</p>



<p>“Is this some child’s tantrum?” Asaki-san raised her voice too, “Sorry, Arisaka-san, but what you did was quite cruel. Some people can get away with a joke, but others can’t. Kisumi-kun was serious. However, you, for your own convenience, toyed with your relationship and betrayed him.”</p>



<p>“I know that much! But…”</p>



<p>For a moment, Yorka seemed about to remain silent but still retorted.</p>



<p>“Don’t act like you’re innocent, honestly…”</p>



<p>“Outsiders should stay out of this!”</p>



<p>“You’re the one who butted into the conversation. For us, you’re an outsider, Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“Don’t talk about my man like you own him! Kisumi is mine!”</p>



<p>“That’s quite an entitled attitude. Greedy.”</p>



<p>“I don’t care what you say. As long as Kisumi is here, that’s enough. Kisumi is everything to me. I’m satisfied just having him. Sena Kisumi is a part of me. I can’t live without him. There’s no replacement. That’s why I won’t let him go. I’ll never let him go for the rest of my life!”</p>



<p>The composed Yorka who usually dealt with classmates was nowhere to be found. She’s just desperately pouring out her entire feelings.</p>



<p>“─Seriously, you’re being too dramatic for high school romance.”</p>



<p>“Then, mind your own business. If you get in the way, I won’t show mercy. Even if you don’t have the intention to fight to the death, keep your hands off my man.”</p>



<p>Arisaka Yorka was serious. She transformed the unwavering love within her into confidence and unleashed the power she had suppressed.</p>



<p>A beautiful woman, both violently and perfectly, displaying the beauty of her resolute love.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/147085.jpg" alt="" /><!--    --></div></figure>



<p>“I absolutely won’t allow Kisumi to fall with anyone else but me!”</p>



<p>Yorka’s declaration echoed throughout the classroom. Even the composed Asaki-san could only react with astonishment.</p>



<p>“My apologies. It seems I misunderstood. Arisaka Yorka is the only one for me. So, can we just forget what happened earlier?”</p>



<p>“Agreed. Living high school life with Arisaka-san glaring at me all the time would be a real pain. Let’s just forget about today.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, Asaki-san.”</p>



<p>She, acting remarkably mature, left the classroom as if nothing had happened. Yorka, however, didn’t loosen her guard until Asaki-san’s figure completely disappeared.</p>



<p>“Yorka, about what happened earlier—”</p>



<p>“You were a bit shaken after that girl confessed, weren’t you?”</p>



<p>Yorka jumped into my arms, pressing her forehead against my chest and hiding her face.</p>



<p>“I mean, I didn’t think she was serious because who would.”</p>



<p>“You kept quiet about being confessed to by Miyauchi-san over spring break either.”</p>



<p>“That’s partly because, first, it was before I heard your answer, and second, it’s a matter of privacy. The recent one, though, was a complete surprise for me…”</p>



<p>“You’re unexpectedly popular, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>My girlfriend was clearly pouting.</p>



<p>“─I feel bad for those two, but I never noticed they have feelings for me.”</p>



<p>“You also hadn’t noticed my feelings for over half a year. Talk about being oblivious.”</p>



<p>“You were really good at hiding it.”</p>



<p>“When we started dating, you must have realized we were complete opposites.”</p>



<p>“I’ve always loved Arisaka Yorka. Before, now, and forever. No other girl is an option. I don’t want to break up with you. I want to be with you always.”</p>



<p>I expressed my feelings more intensely than when I confessed under the cherry blossom tree.</p>



<p>“…Nothing else matters. I can endure anything else. But Kisumi is an exception. I’m anxious. I’m always afraid of what would happen if you started to hate me.”</p>



<p>“I also wondered if I could be with Yorka.”</p>



<p>“Are you still worried…?”</p>



<p>“No. You made up for the wait during spring break with that strong confession.”</p>



<p>“I only love… Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Then, can we skip the part about breaking up?”</p>



<p>“I haven’t heard your answer, so I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>



<p>“…Let’s leave it at that.”</p>



<p>I wrapped my arms around her back, pulling her into a hug.</p>



<p>“Sorry for being such a troublesome girlfriend,” Yorka, too, hugged me, “I love you so much, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“I know that now.”</p>



<p>No matter what anyone said, we were a couple deeply in love.</p>
