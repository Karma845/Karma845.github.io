<h2>Chapter 13: Boldly, Openly, I Want to Flirt</h2>

<p>The next morning, Kanzaki-sensei had an announcement for the class.</p>



<p>“Regarding the recent rumors about a specific student, I have contacted their family. The student in question was confirmed to be at home during the alleged dates. Therefore, the rumors are baseless and entirely false. If I find anyone spreading misinformation about this matter, they will be called to the student guidance office. Be prepared for potential consequences that may also affect your academic standing. I expect everyone to maintain a respectful attitude and sensible behavior as high school students.”</p>



<p>True to her word, Kanzaki-sensei rewarded me appropriately. According to her, the couple seen that morning near the station wasn’t Yorka and me – a masterful power play that completely erased the incident.</p>



<p>Other teachers, trusting Kanzaki-sensei’s thorough investigation, seemed satisfied. The trust and respect she had built up as an educator paid off when needed. I felt grateful that she was our homeroom teacher.</p>



<p>When I later asked Yorka, she explained, “That teacher teamed up with my sister to handle things this way. My sister was a graduate from here and served as student council president since her freshman year, so the older teachers know her well.”</p>



<p>“It’s thanks to the fame of your sister, huh?”</p>



<p>“Even if they expect the same from me, I am who I am.”</p>



<p>Yorka spoke with confidence. Her demeanor when discussing her family was lighter than before.</p>



<p>“Does your sister easily accept you staying out overnight?”</p>



<p>“On the contrary, she was all for it. She even teased me about introducing my boyfriend.”</p>



<p>Yorka wore a complicated expression, part embarrassed, part troubled. Despite her complex feelings about her older sister, it didn’t seem like she disliked her.</p>



<p>The distance between the Arisaka sisters, with their unique dynamics, was something I would come to understand on another occasion.</p>



<p>As the teacher wrapped up the remaining administrative details, she said, “Class representatives, you may dismiss the class,” signaling the end of our usual morning homeroom.</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-sensei, may I have a word?”</p>



<p>“…Certainly.”</p>



<p>I headed towards the podium. Yorka looked at me with a hint of concern. This was something I hadn’t discussed with her.</p>



<p>When I was standing at the podium, I could feel the tension as my classmates’ gazes gathered.</p>



<p>“So, as it turns out, the rumor is officially debunked. Lesson learned—don’t be careless; it might lead to the school contacting your home. Be cautious, everyone.”</p>



<p>I playfully tossed out a joke, and everyone laughed, easing the atmosphere.</p>



<p>“Now, aside from that, I’ve got a personal announcement. I’d appreciate it if you kept this a secret—”</p>



<p>The classroom fell silent.</p>



<p>Somewhere, I believed there would always be a gap between Yorka and me. Accepting the term “unequal couple” was natural. I was just an extra alongside Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>I thought I would just hide in her shadow and keep dating her.</p>



<p>But others’ opinions didn’t matter.</p>



<p>Just as sincerely as I fell for her, Yorka also deeply loved me. Yorka and I shared mutual and equal feelings.</p>



<p>I had made a new resolution. No more hesitation. There was no need to revert to being just friends.</p>



<p>“Yorka and I are dating. She’s my girlfriend.” I boldly declared our relationship in front of our classmates.</p>



<p>“Huh!? Wait! Why are you spilling the beans!” Yorka hurriedly stood up, but it was already too late.</p>



<p>“Making things clear like this is more refreshing, don’t you think?” I responded confidently.</p>



<p>The classroom was enveloped in a lukewarm atmosphere while watching Yorka and me.</p>



<p>“Sena, we’ve known for a while!”</p>



<p>“Congratulations, Sumisumi, Yoryor!”</p>



<p>Nanamura and Miyachi were the first to react.</p>



<p>“Don’t be all lovey-dovey from the morning, you idiot couple,” said Asaki-san, half-smiling.</p>



<p>“Hey, super mismatched couple!</p>



<p>“Class rep hit the jackpot!”</p>



<p>“May you be happy!”</p>



<p>“Don’t get dumped too soon!”</p>



<p>“Teach us your technique!”</p>



<p>“Ahh, I thought Sena-kun was plain, but he’s not bad, huh?”</p>



<p>“How did you two start dating?”</p>



<p>“So jealous!”</p>



<p>“Oh, the passionate cheer during the sports festival explains it!”</p>



<p>Looking at my classmates’ reactions, it seemed like, ever since our second year and the fact she cheered for me during the basketball game, people had started to get a vague sense that we were close.</p>



<p>Well, that’s understandable.</p>



<p>──We got the premise wrong from the beginning.</p>



<p>I, the guy who talked to the conspicuously silent beauty more than anyone else, was the only one she spoke to. Unfortunately, the clandestine romance Yorka yearned for was impossible from the start.</p>



<p>“Kisumi!! What on earth are you thinking?” Yorka, with a bright red face, approached me on the podium.</p>



<p>“It’s just a relationship announcement.”</p>



<p>“Everyone knows now! What are we going to do?”</p>



<p>I grabbed Yorka’s shoulder, who was genuinely angry, and turned her toward our classmates.</p>



<p>“You’re running to me is the perfect evidence. It’s too late now.”</p>



<p>“Huh, no way!?”</p>



<p>Surrounded by an air of tepid interest, we, still wrapped in the freshness of our newly started relationship, stood firm.</p>



<p>“Um, well…” Yorka attempted to escape, but I didn’t let her.</p>



<p>“See? You don’t have to be scared or worried just because everyone isn’t on our side.”</p>



<p>“Y-you’re being too aggressive all of a sudden!”</p>



<p>“Sometimes, I should be the one messing with you, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s not good!”</p>



<p>“Now we can chat openly in class too, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“No, still impossible! It’s embarrassing!”</p>



<p>“They’ll get used to it.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>It seemed that our classmates, witnessing Yorka’s flustered expressions, had finally warmed up to us. If they could speak their minds collectively, it’d be something like, “Arisaka-san, you’re adorable”, which I also agreed.</p>



<p>“…Kisumi, you’re being too forceful.”</p>



<p>“Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to confess to you.”</p>



<p>Yorka was embarrassed and desperately trying to hide behind my back.</p>



<p>Honestly, I wanted to keep her charming self all to myself. Taking this step forward would only enhance her attractiveness.</p>



<p>However, I wanted us to be a couple that grew and changed together. While a regular romcom might treat getting together as the end goal, Yorka and I had just begun.</p>



<p>The enjoyable days with my girlfriend were still ahead of us.</p>
