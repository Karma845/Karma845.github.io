<h3>Chapter 2: Overflowing with Love</h3>

<p>In my high school life, I got myself a girlfriend.</p>



<p><em>“──Hey, Kisumi, come over here…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yorka</em><sup data-fn="931de4ce-c953-410b-8b2f-b63c343139e0" class="fn"><a href="#931de4ce-c953-410b-8b2f-b63c343139e0" id="931de4ce-c953-410b-8b2f-b63c343139e0-link">1</a></sup><em>, no, you just fixed my tie. Don’t take it off already.”</em></p>



<p><em>“This is just in the way right now. I want to feel you closer, Kisumi.”</em></p>



<p><em>“But, not in the classroom. What if someone comes…”</em></p>



<p><em>“That would make it even more exciting. I’ll be honest. Spring break is enough for me.”</em></p>



<p><em>“…Is that okay?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I’ll take off my uniform too.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yorka.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Kisumi, it’s fine.”</em></p>



<p>──My imagination had been running wild for a while. Thanks to that, I didn’t remember much after her answer to my confession. I was so elated that the principal’s long speech didn’t bother me at all, and before I knew it, the opening ceremony was over, and I was back in the classroom.</p>



<p>I honestly couldn’t recall what I said during the self-introduction in homeroom. Nanamura Ryuu, a friend I made last year in the basketball club, must have casually teased me enough to prevent any awkward atmosphere. On the other hand, Arisaka breezed through her introduction with the bare minimum information.</p>



<p>“I’m Arisaka. I have nothing special to say.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but be impressed by her cool demeanor, as if our interaction before the opening ceremony never happened. It seemed like my patience was the only one being tested.</p>



<p>After finishing the self-introduction and taking her seat, she glanced at me. In that brief exchange of looks, I felt the realization that the confession had succeeded.</p>



<p>Uh-oh, my face was naturally breaking into a smile.</p>



<p>When I was with Arisaka Yorka, I could confidently match the tension of being with an exceptionally beauty. But once freed from it, my mind became a field of flowers in full spring bloom—vibrant and colorful.</p>



<p>You can laugh at my rosy outlook. Even I was surprised.</p>



<p><em>This could dangerous</em>, I worry about the future.</p>



<p>As promised, I had no intention of displaying lovey-dovey moves with Arisaka in the classroom. I didn’t want to show off having a beautiful girlfriend, and there was a certain superiority in keeping it a secret.</p>



<p>However, emotions had a way of leaking out, even if you tried to conceal them. Despite my efforts to stay composed, I found myself closely observing my girlfriend.</p>



<p>“As expected from the one who started this. A poker face pro.”</p>



<p>Arisaka maintained her composed demeanor. When faced with such calmness, even I might momentarily forget that we were dating. As an experiment, I pinched my cheek while resting my head on my hand. </p>



<p><em>It hurts. This is reality.</em></p>



<p>“Sena-san. You’ve been spacing out and fidgety for a while now, you also lack focus,” Kanzaki-sensei, who was standing at the teacher’s podium, scolded me.</p>



<p>“Is it that obvious?”</p>



<p>“Pull yourself together. I’m planning to make you the class representative again this year.” With a small sigh of exasperation, Kanzaki-sensei turned to another student. “Hasekura-san, please give the commands in his place.”</p>



<p>“Yes. Since Sena-kun spacing out today, I’ll be giving the orders. Stand up—”</p>



<p>With the pleasant voice of Hasekura Asahi,</p>



<p>Today’s homeroom came to an end.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi. You had a face like a zombie in the morning, but now you’re in a surprisingly good mood.”</p>



<p>The girl who lazily approached me was Miyauchi Hinaka, we were in the same class as last year.</p>



<p>She had short blond hair, piercings in her ears, and a remarkably youthful face with lively, round eyes resembling an adorable little animal. She was on the shorter side, fair-skinned and slender, wearing an oversized hoodie instead of the school uniform jacket. The hoodie always slipped off one shoulder, and she had a habit of swinging the excess sleeve around.</p>



<p>Our school, Eisei High, allowed for individualistic styles due to its liberal atmosphere for a prep school, but she was particularly loved by everyone for her distinctive charm.</p>



<p>As a side note, she also had a tendency to give strange nicknames to close friends. I was Kisumi, so I was Sumisumi. And in return, I called her Miyachi.</p>



<p>“Is that so? It seems pretty normal to me.”</p>



<p>“It’s completely different. You kept spacing out even when Kanzaki-sensei nominated you as the class rep two years in a row.”</p>



<p>“Then, Miyachi, you can do it instead.”</p>



<p>“Girls are already set on Asaki-chan, right?”</p>



<p>“I never agreed to do it.”</p>



<p>“You said the same thing last year and ended up not refusing,” Miyachi laughed.</p>



<p>“I vote for Sena too. If you’re the class rep, you’re likely to do all sorts of request for us,” Nanamura Ryuu, the basketball team’s ace, joined in.</p>



<p>“Tsk, don’t treat me like a handyman, Nanamura.”</p>



<p>Entering the conversation was the towering figure of Nanamura Ryuu, standing at 190 centimeters. His muscular build, when standing next to Miyachi, created a stark contrast akin to a giant and a fairy.</p>



<p>“Nanamu. We’re in the same class this year. I’ll be counting on you.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, count on me. You’re still small as ever.”</p>



<p>“Nanamu is just too big!”</p>



<p>The largest guy and the smallest girl in the class engaged in a peaceful conversation.</p>



<p>“By the way, Sena. You’ve been staring at Arisaka-chan a lot since we got back to the classroom. Something up?”</p>



<p>“…Not really.” I casually brushed off Nanamura’s observation.</p>



<p>“Don’t lie. You were practically glued to her. Your eyes were bloodshot.”</p>



<p>“Must be your imagination. I’m just a bit sleep-deprived.”</p>



<p>“Then sleep until the last minute. You were in the classroom unusually early this morning.”</p>



<p>Nanamura, bright and lively but serious about club activities, always completed morning practice before coming to class. That’s how he knew I arrived earlier than usual today.</p>



<p>“Oh my, Sumisumi seems suspicious today, doesn’t he, Nanamu?”</p>



<p>“This is fishy, Miyauchi.”</p>



<p>The duo exchanged meaningful glances.</p>



<p>“It’s weird for you two to take an interest in someone like me.”</p>



<p>“Well, we know that observing the bland and uninteresting ‘Normal Sena-kun’ is boring. But today is different.”</p>



<p>“Nanamu, you’re exaggerating. Sumisumi is just reserved and mature.”</p>



<p>“Basically, he’s plain and unremarkable.”</p>



<p>“Don’t rub it in!”</p>



<p><em>…They’re saying whatever they want</em>. I chuckled, and suddenly, I noticed Arisaka was already gone from the classroom.</p>



<p>Did she leave early? No, she was undoubtedly in the art preparation room. That’s Arisaka’s usual routine.</p>



<p>“Instead of spouting nonsense, why don’t you guys go home already? I’m leaving,” I said, swinging my bag over my shoulder.</p>



<p>“Nanamu, the suspect is attempting an escape!”</p>



<p>“Sena, the joke is over. Confess quietly. And while you’re at it, repay the favor for the time I covered for you during self-introduction.” Nanamura, a massive barrier, blocked my path.</p>



<p>“I’m not thinking straight due to lack of sleep. I came early because I couldn’t sleep until dawn.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, I’m a bit worried about that, though.”</p>



<p>“I’ll get some good sleep when I get home.”</p>



<p>“Miyauchi, you’re quite lenient with Sena.” Nanamura seemed dissatisfied that Miyachi backed off so easily.</p>



<p>“Unlike you, Miyachi isn’t crude. If I owe you, I’ll repay it properly next time. See ya.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, looking forward to it,” Nanamura stepped aside.</p>



<p>“See you later. Have a good sleep!” Miyachi waved her long sleeves to bid me farewell.</p>



<p>Leaving the classroom, I headed straight for the art preparation room. The art prep room was located deep inside the school building. This was Arisaka Yoruka’s hidden sanctuary.</p>



<p>I gently opened the unlocked door. The bright interior, bathed in soft sunlight, carried a faint scent of oil paints. Replicas of famous paintings adorned the walls, and student works crammed the metal shelves in a chaotic array, reaching from the floor to the top.</p>



<p>Out of habit, I checked the higher shelves to make sure nothing was about to fall. The plaster sculptures on a side table had their eyes deliberately turned away by Arisaka to avoid eye contact.</p>



<p>And in the blind spot behind a shelf on the door side, that small space was Arisaka’s usual spot. Basking in a sunlit corner, she peacefully slept, breathing quietly.</p>



<p>“She’s so laid-back.”</p>



<p>Her face, flawless from every angle, was a sculpture of beauty that God might had been overly generous in bestowing upon a human. She easily rivaled the masterpieces of beauties displayed in this room or the goddesses in plaster.</p>



<p>I must be quite fortunate to witness this scene. If I had artistic talent, I’d want to capture this emotion in paintings or music.</p>



<p>I silently placed my bag down and gazed at her sleeping face.</p>



<p><em>I could watch her forever</em>. While I’d love to confidently declare this like a suave gentleman, as a real high school boy, I couldn’t execute such sophisticated moves like a character from a shoujo manga.</p>



<p>Because my memory alone was unreliable, I discreetly opened the camera on my phone, trying to secretly capture this profound moment. Focusing on composition with heightened awareness of every rustle, movement, and breath, I carefully set up the shot.</p>



<p>However, Arisaka, keenly sensing my dubious actions, woke up.</p>



<p>“…Could you stop staring at me?”</p>



<p>“Pretending to sleep, huh?”</p>



<p>“Sena, you sure took your sweet time.”</p>



<p>“I got caught up talking with friends.”</p>



<p>“And honestly, you stare at me too much even in class.”</p>



<p>“So, you noticed. My friends mentioned it too.”</p>



<p>“It’s not just ‘noticed’! Even the teacher warned you, anyone would have found out! I’ve been trying so hard not to let my expression slip!”</p>



<p>“Hmm, so Arisaka was trying hard too?”</p>



<p>“Of course! Otherwise, things wouldn’t go smoothly!” She vented her frustration at me.</p>



<p>“I’m a bit relieved. You’re happy about this too.”</p>



<p>“──Well, you’re my first boyfriend. Even I’d be a bit excited.”</p>



<p><strong>First boyfriend</strong>. Those words had nice ring to it. I savored their beauty as I gazed toward the sky.</p>



<p>“So precious.”</p>



<p>“Don’t suddenly close your eyes and get all blissful. Gross.”</p>



<p>“I was expressing my gratitude to the gods of love.”</p>



<p>“Forget the gods, look at me.”</p>



<p>“You scolded me earlier because I stared too much.”</p>



<p>“That was in class. Here, it’s just the two of us.”</p>



<p>At Arisaka’s suggestive remark, I swallowed nervously.</p>



<p>Our eyes met. The distance between us wasn’t too close or too far. If I reached out, I could touch her instantly. I could see her face clearly.</p>



<p>In the gentle spring sunlight, I contemplated the best course of action.</p>



<p>My eyes were drawn to her lips.</p>



<p><em>Is this one of those moments where it’s okay to kiss? It’s fine, right?</em></p>



<p>“Sena?”</p>



<p>“Arisaka,” I leaned slightly forward, closing the distance.</p>



<p>Suddenly, Arisaka, sensing the shift in the atmosphere, hurriedly stood up. “Right, Sena! You must be hungry! You skipped breakfast, so let’s go for lunch! Yeah, that’s it! That’s the plan!”</p>



<p>“I wanted to look at you a bit longer.”</p>



<p>“No way. My face would catch fire.” Arisaka let out a warm sigh.</p>



<p>Despite her bold front, she was incredibly weak to light affection, acting all shy and innocent. That gap made my heart flutter.</p>



<p>This, in its own way, was quite delightful and worth looking forward to.</p>



<p>“My girlfriend is absolutely cute,” I slipped out my overly honest impression.</p>



<p>“Why do I feel like I lost, even though I’m being praised?”</p>



<p>“Is there really a win or lose between lovers?”</p>



<p>“Even though I’m the one who clearly likes you more, it feels like that hasn’t gotten through.”</p>



<p>“How can you win?”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t be able to live without Sena.”</p>



<p>“…Well, I’ve felt that way for a while now.”</p>



<p>“Huh!?” Arisaka let out a surprised yelp.</p>



<p>Watching her honest reaction to my response, I felt a sense of enlightenment, like I’d grasped something.</p>



<p>“I’m full now.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Aren’t we going for lunch?”<br />Arisaka, misinterpreting my words, suddenly looked at me with a worried expression.</p>



<p>Although my girlfriend had this cool image, it seemed she had a rich range in expressing her emotions.</p>



<p>“Of course, we’re going! It’s an invitation from you, there’s no way I’d refuse!”</p>



<p>Arisaka’s smile returned, and that’s when I finally understood the feeling of someone wanting to proudly boast about their partner.</p>



<p>MY GIRLFRIEND IS ADORABLE AS HELL!!</p>



<p>I wanted to shout that at the top of my lungs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>To avoid being spotted by our classmates, we decided to have lunch at a family restaurant a bit away from the station.</p>



<p>While there might be suspicions about us being a couple, that’s just the sad reality of a pair with a noticeable gap. But as long as we didn’t hold hands, no one would think of us as lovers.</p>



<p>I was aware about the imbalance between me, an ordinary guy, and the school’s renowned beauty, Arisaka Yorka, that’s why it should be easy to keep our relationship a secret.</p>



<p>“Hey, Arisaka. If you’re worried, we could just meet there,” I suggested, trying to be considerate.</p>



<p>It was noon, and most students had already left since today was just the opening ceremony. Still, Arisaka was overly cautious about the distance between us. It started the moment we left the art preparation room. After changing shoes at the lockers, we walked as if our paths home coincidentally matched.</p>



<p>“No, it’s lonely not being able to talk together.”</p>



<p><em>And there it is – Is she an adorable alien from the planet Cute or what?</em></p>



<p>With her mature appearance, Arisaka’s childlike imitation made her cuteness even more prominent. She kept a careful distance, glancing around vigilantly while maintaining just the right distance for conversation.</p>



<p>Because the family restaurant wasn’t crowded yet during lunchtime, we quickly found a seat.</p>



<p>“What should I eat?”</p>



<p>While Arisaka carefully examined the menu, I decided almost instantly without even opening it.</p>



<p>“I’ll go for the mixed grill with an extra-large portion of rice and the drink bar set.”</p>



<p>“Already decided?”</p>



<p>“My favorites never change.”</p>



<p>“You’re so decisive.” Arisaka studied the menu with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“You seem to be taking a while.”</p>



<p>Arisaka lifted her face from the menu, eyeing me with a meaningful expression. “This is my first time at a family restaurant, so I don’t know what’s good.”</p>



<p>“Seriously?”</p>



<p>How many high school girls these days have yet to experience a nationwide chain family restaurant in Japan?</p>



<p>“You’re quite sheltered, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“Never had the chance. When I was little, a housekeeper used to prepare my meals, now I enjoy cooking as a hobby. I never had close friends to go out with either.”</p>



<p>I’d heard before that the Arisaka family lived in a top-floor penthouse of a tower apartment in the heart of Tokyo. Her parents, both busy with work domestically and internationally, rarely come home. Her older sister, a university student majoring in science, slept at her research lab on weekdays, practically living alone most of the time.</p>



<p>“Well, from now on, you can come with me anytime. Just choose what you’re in the mood for today, and next time, order something different.”</p>



<p>“The first time is important.”</p>



<p>“I don’t remember what I ordered the first time at a family restaurant. Probably something like a kid’s meal.”</p>



<p>“But you do remember.”</p>



<p>“A kindergartener wouldn’t order things like a Cobb salad or a Japanese-style set meal, right?”</p>



<p>“…But, today is my first date with Sena.” Arisaka said, covering her face with the menu to hide her shyness.</p>



<p><em>So cute</em>. I felt like I was going to die from the cuteness.</p>



<p>“What’s this button for?” Arisaka asked then pressed the call button, almost like trying to divert the conversation.</p>



<p>“May I help you?” Naturally, a waiter arrived to take our order.</p>



<p>“Uh, well. Then, Sena, order for me!” She panicked and threw the responsibility my way.</p>



<p>“Mixed grill with extra rice and seafood tomato pasta for her. Two drink bar sets. Also, please bring us some french fries. Is that alright, Arisaka?”</p>



<p>“Perfect.”</p>



<p>The waiter repeated the order for confirmation and then closed the tablet.</p>



<p>“Please use the drink bar over there,” he said before leaving.</p>



<p>“Hey, why did you decide so quickly? And why seafood tomato pasta?”</p>



<p>“I ordered something I wanted to eat. If you don’t want it, you can exchange with mine. Besides, if we go for meat and seafood, we won’t overlap. You don’t have a seafood allergy. And the fries are for both of us.”</p>



<p>“…Sena, you always take on any requests, huh?”</p>



<p>“Should we also have dessert in the end?”</p>



<p>“I’m all for that.”</p>



<p>“Great.”</p>



<p>“Oh, how about we order something different and share?”</p>



<p>“Sounds good.”</p>



<p>“Then it’s settled!”</p>



<p>Arisaka happily browsed the menu again, and I took a moment to admire her joy.</p>



<p>“Sena, is it fun just looking at me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it is.”</p>



<p>“But your gaze is distracting.”</p>



<p>“Well then, while you’re deciding on dessert, should I grab us a drink? Any preferences?”</p>



<p>“Wait. I’ll come with you.”</p>



<p>We headed to the drink bar together. Arisaka got excited again while operating the drink dispenser.</p>



<p>“This is fun! So many options, and you can drink as much as you want!” she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling like a child’s.</p>



<p>Indeed, I, too, used to find the act of pouring drinks fascinating when I was little.</p>



<p>I thought our first date would be more nervewracking. However, in the familiar territory of the family restaurant, her unexpected enjoyment made me feel less awkward than expected.</p>



<p>Girls’ smiles were truly magnificent. While troubles could become enjoyable surprises as you accumulated experiences, the first one should ideally be in a situation with fewer uncertainties.</p>



<p>As I was sipping my drink, I secretly felt a light sense of relief. We returned to the table with our beverages, and soon our meals were served.</p>



<p>“<em>Itadakimasu</em>,” she said, clasping her hands together in front of the seafood tomato pasta.</p>



<p>I found her manner charming. Even familiar dishes taste far better when shared with Arisaka.</p>



<p>While we were savoring our dessert after the meal, there was one more thing I needed to address.</p>



<p>“Arisaka.”</p>



<p>“Why the sudden serious expression?” Arisaka, using a long spoon to eat her parfait, stopped and looked at me attentively.</p>



<p>“There’s still an important step we haven’t taken.”</p>



<p>“On our first date, we had a pleasant meal. What more could we want?”</p>



<p>“Actually, most couples address this before getting into a relationship.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Is it that crucial?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Our unfulfilled desires during spring break was probably due to neglecting this.”</p>



<p>“What exactly are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“Intimate interactions between a man and a woman are essential to deepening relationships. In extreme cases, couples without such connections might as well be on the verge of breaking up!” I passionately emphasized the point.</p>



<p>“Deepening the relationship, intimate interactions. Without those, they’ll break up… Could it be—”</p>



<p>Arisaka took a deep breath, seemingly catching on to what I was implying.</p>



<p>“But doing that before even officially dating… Is that normal? Is that how it’s done?”</p>



<p>“Actually, it’s more surprising that we haven’t.”</p>



<p>“Is this a joke? Isn’t the order wrong? Don’t you normally go through stages and save that, you know, for last? Does everyone just do it without much fuss?”</p>



<p>Arisaka, seeming more agitated than necessary, turned redder by the second.</p>



<p>“I want to do it right now!”</p>



<p>“Why are you saying something so absurd in a family restaurant!?”</p>



<p>Arisaka shouted with a voice far louder than my determined declaration. The attention of the entire restaurant focused on our table. Arisaka shrunk down like a cat.</p>



<p>“I don’t think what I said is absurd…”</p>



<p>Now it’s my turn to be bewildered by her hypersensitive reaction.</p>



<p>“…Sena, have you been wanting to do this since last year? Like, when you were in the art prep room, were you always thinking about that?”</p>



<p>“Well, if the timing was right, I did consider it.”</p>



<p>“…I sense danger.”</p>



<p>“Arisaka, are you, by any chance, thinking of something way too ahead!?”</p>



<p>“Don’t play innocent, you beast.”</p>



<p>Being intensely scrutinized by the beautiful girl, I finally understood the source of her misunderstanding.</p>



<p>“What I want is—exchanging contact information.”</p>



<p>“Why haven’t we done that until now?”</p>



<p>My girlfriend asked with a straight face, seamlessly shifting back to casual conversation like the earlier misunderstanding never happened. The aura around her made it clear not to mention the previous confusion.</p>



<p>“Probably because you always seemed uninterested in having friends.”</p>



<p>She had been surprisingly adamant about not exchanging contact information with anyone since entering school. She wasn’t even part of the class group LINE. Last year, if needed, I would verbally pass along any necessary information.</p>



<p>“Well, there hasn’t been anyone I wanted to talk to or exchange messages with.”</p>



<p>“Then you have LINE installed?”</p>



<p>“Only for communication with family.”</p>



<p>“How about adding a boyfriend to that?” I stated once again, expecting a straightforward “Sure,” given the flow of the conversation.</p>



<p>However, Arisaka suddenly fell silent. With a composed face, she just stared directly into my eyes.</p>



<p>“Is that a no?” I couldn’t bear the silence and cautiously asked.</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s fine,” she replied, smiling.</p>



<p>“Your mischief is bad for my heart.” I sighed, resting my forehead on the table.</p>



<p>“Why are you so shaken?”</p>



<p>“When you’re joking, please make it a bit more obvious. It’s too convincing to brush off.”</p>



<p>A beautiful girl’s poker face left no room for error.</p>



<p>“I just wanted to scare you a bit since you’ve been leading all along.” My girlfriend said this innocently.</p>



<p>“I only brought you to a family restaurant; don’t make it sound so grand.”</p>



<p>“I’d appreciate anything my boyfriend does for me.”</p>



<p>And so, after nearly a year, we had finally exchanged contact information.</p>
