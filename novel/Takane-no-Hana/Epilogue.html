<h3>Epilogue.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week has passed since my dismissal was suddenly revoked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was scheduled to attend a social event hosted by the Konohana family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How do you feel about the suit?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s comfortable]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san carefully checks the suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event is said to be gorgeous, as it is hosted by Konohana Group under its prestigious name. The venue is already packed with people, ready to start at any time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This time, Itsuki-san is ostensibly in an awkward position… In other words, as the son and heir of a medium sized company, you are invited here. If you aren’t confident in your manners, at least try to act inconspicuous]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Shizune-san worked casually, I suddenly opened my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san. Once again, thank you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I continued to say to Shizune-san, who turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After the incident at the meal the other day, It was Shizune-san who convinced Keigon-san to hire me as a caretaker again, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It is true that I approached Keigon-sama about it, but it is thanks to Itsuki-san’s achievements that made it possible]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said while tightening the tie around my neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[To be honest, I was a little nervous that day. I decided that words alone weren’t enough to persuade Keigon-sama, and I was going to try to do so after showing him the invitation letter I ordered from the main residence… I never thought Itsuki-san would make such a bold move before that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m sorry]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still remember what Shizune-san said to me that day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m someone employed by Keigon-sama, but I am on Ojou-sama’s side. ―Shizune-san told us so. I’m sure that Shizune-san also works hard for Hinako in ways I don’t know about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, I’ll go back to work]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san says after checking the suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[During the event, of course, you have to stay on your toes, if you can’t do that, you can at least observe the people around you. I think you will learn a lot]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. …For me, this is like training]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naturally]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From now on, Itsuki-san has to continue growing]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Shizune turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From now on. Those words brought relief to my heart. At least Shizune-san will take care of me. She thinks days like these will continue. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, the event began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event brought together political bigshots, presidents and executives of major corporations, and other related parties. When I stepped into the glamorous venue, I instantly felt uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m so out of place]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san told me not to stand out, and I should remain quiet about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved to the sides of the venue, avoiding line of sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey hey, Tomonari-kun!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a voice called out to me from behind and my shoulders jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around and saw 2 familiar figures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Asahi-san, and Taisho-kun huh…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yo]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to Asahi-san, who was full of energy, Taisho also greeted me casually. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike me, they’re used to the atmosphere here, and they walked down the hall and approached me with dignity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, Tomonari, you’re using a nice suit. That’s an Italian brand, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I prepared it for this day. To be honest, I’m not used to wearing it…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahhh… I feel the same way. The most important thing to remember is that you can’t be too careful with what you wear. I can’t afford to be embarrassed by a bad suit, and I think it’s worth taking care of]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho is probably right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and looked at Asahi-san’s outfit as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You look gorgeous in that dress, Asahi-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Right!? Then, did you fall in love with me!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-yeah, I fell in love with you…] (TN: secret contender?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered with a wry smile to Asahi-san, who spun around and puffed out her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a little stretch, but I won’t tell anyone. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari, you can be honest with her. Anybody can look good with the right clothes.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahaha! Taisho-kun, you make funny jokes. Do you mind coming over here for a minute?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho disappeared somewhere after Asahi-san pulled him by the ear. (TN: False alarm! We’re clear!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the two left, a blonde girl approached me as if swapping with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[They’re as lively as ever]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Tennouji-san who muttered this with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But perhaps one of your talents is that you can be at your ease in any environment]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a word that stuck strongly in my mind as I was wasting away on the side of the hall. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Itsuki…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From behind me, I heard a familiar voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Naruka huh]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uuu… help me. What a glamorous space. It’s too dazzling… too bright…] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka looked pale and weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san sighed at the sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Miyakojima-san… you won’t survive it in the future at that rate]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-well, that’s true, but it’s all in my nature&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geez. …This is a good opportunity, why not take drastic measures for once?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[D-Drastic measures?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come with me to make rounds. Fortunately, there are bigshots from all industries in this venue, so you should be able to find the nerve to talk to them]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-no, I don’t want to! If I do that, I’ll die!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san forcefully took Naruka, who was half-crying, somewhere. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re as lively as Asahi-san and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Everyone’s having a great time…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched the girls’ back as they went away and muttered to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a little thirsty, so I went to get a drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, I spotted someone with a luxurious suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made up my mind, and called out to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Keigon-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed my head to Keigon-san, who turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for all you prepared for us today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san looked a little surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought you might hold a grudge or two against me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It doesn’t mean anything if I say it… In the end, it was a good result for me, so I won’t strangle myself here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no merit in offending Keigon-san’s mood in this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I told him so, Keigon-san gave me a calm gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought you were more of an intuitive person, but it seems like you’re able to turn your head. …But that day, did you try to rush me?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon muttered and turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san started walking with a glass of wine in his hand and beckoned me over. Looks like he wants to change places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We went to a balcony connected to the venue. We walked a short distance and turned the corner, and we arrived somewhere with no people around. Keigon-san stopped there and rested his elbows on the railing to catch his breath. I stood next to him silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako is a genius]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san suddenly said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She seems to be the best in the school]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s not what I’m talking about]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking a sip of his wine, Keigon-san spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako has a problematic personality, but she has a natural gift when it comes to practical matters. …She has inherited talents befitting her Konohana family bloodline]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san said as he stared into the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s why I want Hinako to take over the family. Of course, ostensibly the son-in-law will take over… but there’s no reason not to take advantage of that talent. And once she graduates from the academy, she’ll be free from the constraints of time, and if she’s given a private room for work, the workload will be greatly reduced. If we can get through this time, we can make a breakthrough]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like I understood a little bit more about what the future looked like as Keigon-san saw it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I don’t want to understand it, I don’t want to sympathise with it, and I don’t want to agree with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;However, is it really necessary for it to be Hinako?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha, if there’s a replacement, I will take that without doubt]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, the burden of Konohana is heavy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san’s smile quickly faded, and he said with a mysterious look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The total number of employees in the group is approximately 800,000. Half-hearted talent isn’t enough. A single mistake can cost many employees their lives, or they can be crushed by pressure… and even lose their loved ones]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, Keigon-san stroked the ring on his ring finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to what Shizune-san told me, in the Konohana family, not only the head of the family works, but also the wife of said family head. …But I heard that Keigon-san’s wife had passed away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure that Keigon-san has experienced something in his past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean he can look down on Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Keigon-san, how do you feel about Hinako?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something I always wanted to ask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san lowered his gaze and replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I put the house before my daughter. At this point to me, both my daughter and my son are cogs in the Konohana family]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lifting his elbow on the railing, Keigon-san turns to the hall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And of course… myself included]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a small mutter, Keigon-san left the balcony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chilly night breeze hit my cheeks. Even the heat of the hall doesn’t reach here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to stay on the balcony to cool down my head.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a pretty girl with amber hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, wearing a beautiful white dress, approached me with small steps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you doing here?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Papa said Itsuki was here, so…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no one around. So Hinako is here as her true self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Thank you for continuing being my caretaker]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, while touching the balcony railing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What Itsuki said to me that time… it made me really happy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That must’ve been the time when I dared to say it in front of Shizune-san. I was thinking a lot of things in the heat of the moment, so being reminded of that time was kind of embarrassing. …But if Hinako feels happy about it, it’s not a problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… will continue to believe in Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stared at me with pure and innocent eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her attitude, her expression, her words and her actions strongly affected my emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pushed down my agitation and replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes―I almost forget.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako doesn’t see me as the opposite sex. In order to meet her expectations, I shouldn’t see her as the opposite sex more than necessary.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuuu….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako resting her chin on the railing, letting out a distracted sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I greeted a lot of people, I’m tired. …Pat my head]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chuckled as she offered me her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, what I’m expected to provide is the warmth of a family member. To meet that, I stroked Hinako’s head as gently as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muu?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I stroked her, Hinako let out a strange sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Mu? …Muuu?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I continued to stroke her head, her face began to flush red―.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuu~!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who was bright red to the tips of her ears, suddenly backed away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s eyes widened in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-ree…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong? You’re suddenly all flushed…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, it’s nothing]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was puzzled, as she didn’t seem to understand what happened to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could’ve been sick. Worried, I walked up to Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you’re not feeling well, you shouldn’t push yoursel―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-No, it’s nothing, really…!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strangely restless, Hinako backed away again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Areee?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t tell me… she’s avoiding me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as I know, this is the first time Hinako has been so plainly flustered. …I wonder if she wants to get away from me so badly that she conveyed it so clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I get too close?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, but I’ve done things like this many times before.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Weird]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, as if hiding her bright red face, touched her cheeks with both hands and muttered curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I…. something’s strange…]</span></p>
