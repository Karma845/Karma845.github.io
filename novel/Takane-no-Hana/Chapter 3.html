<h3>Chapter 3 - Tea Party.</h3>
																		        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third day of my school life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the second period class was over and  break started, Taisho and Asahi-san came over to me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari, how about after school today? I know you said before that you had to go back early, but it&#8217;s okay to let loose once in a while, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded to Taisho with a smile on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m free today, so I should be able to]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, great!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the discussion I had with Shizune-san the other day, it&#8217;s decided I could go after school as long as I report to her. I&#8217;ll report to Shizune-san by lunchtime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where do you want to go, Tomonari-kun? If you don&#8217;t have anywhere in mind, we&#8217;ll decide for ourselves]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Right I&#8217;ll leave it to you then]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know much about where the students of this academy go to kill time after school, so I decided to leave it to them so I don&#8217;t mess up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What should we do, Taisho-kun? It&#8217;s only a day trip, we can&#8217;t go abroad can we?] (TN: talk about a different realm of &#8220;after-school&#8221; activities)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It only takes three hours one way to get to Taiwan, but if we only have dinner and go back home, it&#8217;ll still take more than a day so I think it&#8217;s better to stay domestic]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, how about Kyoto? At this time of year, Kyoto bamboo shoots are tasty]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kyoto, huh? I know a good place in Kyoto]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to both of them casually discussing made me break out in cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right, I forgot. These two are also bourgeois. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not available for that long. Even if I have an open schedule, I have to be back at nightfall, so please be somewhere close if possible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. Then better not go too far]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I hadn&#8217;t intervened, I wonder if I actually would&#8217;ve gone to Kyoto</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How about the cafe in the academy? Isn&#8217;t it just the right place to talk?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah yeah, that would be nice]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to Taisho, who expressed his agreement, I nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The academy has several cafes for tea parties. Some of them are quite authentic, but since it&#8217;s in the academy, there&#8217;s not need for dress codes, and they&#8217;re popular among students]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I seeI didn&#8217;t know that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when you go to a real restaurant, you have to pay attention to your manners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve been taking etiquette from Shizune-san, but I&#8217;m still nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But the purpose of this meeting is to get to know each other better, so a place where we can talk casually is good. Why don&#8217;t we go to the cafe next to the cafeteria?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That too I guess]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san agreed to Taisho&#8217;s suggestion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I inwardly thanked Taisho. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t have to go to a full fledged restaurant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But it&#8217;s going to be a little lonely just with the three of us]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I guess so. We need a couple more people]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho and Asahi-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari, if there&#8217;s anyone else you can invite, tell us, okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah I&#8217;ll give it some thought]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunch break. Hinako and I were eating lunch on the roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki, next is kombu] (TN: kombu is seaweed)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I picked up a piece of kombu from Hinako&#8217;s lunchbox and brought it to Hinako&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mmm, It&#8217;s delicious]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it really is delicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected of Hinako, she has good taste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, why don&#8217;t you at least eat your food on your own..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nooo~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you can act, that means you can eat on your own if you want to, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nu uh, I refuse~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s hard to argue when she says that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hinako was chewing, I switched chopsticks and ate my own lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you going out to play today?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m playing, I&#8217;m just going to a cafe with my classmates]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m coming with you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said in a matter-of-fact tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If Itsuki goes, I go too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s fine with me, but have you gotten permission from Shizune-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I&#8217;ll do that now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hinako pulled her phone out of her pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako operates her phone in an unfamiliar way, and holds it to her ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ojou-sama? What can I do for you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san&#8217;s voice was audible to me as she was on the phone beside me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I want to go to a tea party. I&#8217;m going with Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;I understand. I was originally planning to work around Itsuki-sama&#8217;s schedule today, so there&#8217;s no problem with Ojou-sama&#8217;s participation&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was easier than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like me, Hinako is thought to be a little suspicious of how much she&#8217;s socializing. It&#8217;s already assumed that, to some extent, Hinako already has plans after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But, Ojou-sama, are you sure? I think we&#8217;re getting close to the limit”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It&#8217;s okay]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near the end, I heard an unfamiliar exchange, but Hinako quickly ended the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then I&#8217;ll be looking forward working with you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. By the way, the ones participating so far are Taisho and Asahi-san, do you know them?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know their names]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I frowned at the vague and ambiguous reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if she would be able to have a good conversation with someone she knows only by name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You know, you don&#8217;t have to force yourself to participate. It&#8217;s just a social event, and if you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll enjoy it, it&#8217;s better not to come along&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If Itsuki goes, I go]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s hard to understand why, but if she&#8217;s willing to do it, there&#8217;s no need to stop her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunch break is over, thus Hinako and I head back to the school building separately, keeping our distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There&#8217;s 4 of us right now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four going after school, including Hinako. I think it&#8217;s enough as it is, but there&#8217;s one more person I thought of inviting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She said she wanted to make friends, should I invite her?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went ahead and invited the clumsy and lonely girl.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person I was looking for, Miyakojima Naruka, was easy to find.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other day at PE, I found out that Naruka&#8217;s class was 2nd year, class B. I was making sure Hinako had returned to the classroom and was wearing her facade, and I immediately headed to the classroom of class B. I found Naruka within seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s just there alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I expected, Naruka spent her lunch break alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka, who sits second from the back by the window, seems to be eating quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a distance, she was a beautiful woman with a dignified appearance, but if you looked closely, you could see wrinkles between her eyebrows, and her eyes looked unhappy. No wonder why people don&#8217;t approach her.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/L5ctvvR/Screenshot-20220715-124245.png" alt="Screenshot-20220715-124245" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like to reach out to her if I could, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I thought of that, Naruka turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;? Itsuki!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Naruka noticed me, she stopped eating and suddenly stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Naruka, who looked incredibly happy, approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Class B was in a state of shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, you&#8217;re kidding, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mi-Miyakojima-san called out a person&#8217;s name?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard a lot of sad rumors and gossip, but Naruka came to me without noticing anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka&#8217;s eyes sparkled as she opened her mouth, and I may have regretted being too conspicuous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-What is it!? Do you need me!? I-I was free just now! We can talk about anything!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t get so close</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she was quite lonely being alone. (TN: myes, the floor is made out of floor)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, can we change places for now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[! O-Of course, I&#8217;ll follow you! I&#8217;ll follow you no matter where you go!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked out of the school building with Naruka as countless eyes stared at us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to stay as close to class A as possible, so I could quickly react if Hinako acted unexpectedly. I went to the back of the school building, where there&#8217;s less visibility, and turned around to look at Naruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, there&#8217;s a lot I need to talk to you about. I haven&#8217;t been able to explain what happened the other day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The other day Ah, right! I still haven&#8217;t forgiven you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if she had come to her senses, Naruka&#8217;s face turned red as she revealed her anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-You were taking care of me, but how did you suddenly work for Konohona-san! T-This, ugh, y-you traitor!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I was with Naruka in the past]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[S-Saying it was just in the past is cruel! I&#8217;ve always wanted to live with you again!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh. Is.. that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was surprised, Naruka seemed to realize what she said, and her face turned even brighter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[U-Uaaaaa!? T-That was nothing! Nothing! Forget about it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yeah It&#8217;d be great if you calm down a little]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn&#8217;t it even worse than it used to be? I&#8217;m starting to feel bad for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[About the thing yesterday the short version is, I&#8217;m adopted]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Adopted?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. My current father is the president of a medium-sized company. And the president has a relationship with the Konohana family, so while I&#8217;m attending the academy, I ended up working for the Konohana family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu wait. How can that be? Just because you&#8217;re related to the Konohana family doesn&#8217;t mean you have to work for them]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew she&#8217;d say that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calmly, I remembered the settings from last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You know what an apprenticeship is?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. In Japan, it became popular around the Meiji era (1862-1912), and in Europe, it&#8217;s been a customary since the middle ages] (TN: a sudden history lesson)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s studying hard. Naruka is also a Kiou Academy student and her intelligence and cleverness is incomparable to mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m working for the Konohana family in a sort of apprenticeship. I don&#8217;t know anything about etiquette, after all. That&#8217;s why instead of studying, I work at the Konohana house]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see. So that&#8217;s what it is]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, I&#8217;m amazed at how Shizune-san was able to come up with such an idea. The cover was perfect, and even if it was investigated, it&#8217;s able to be covered up to a certain extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[B-But if that&#8217;s the case, my house would&#8217;ve also been fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, even if you tell me that, the first thing that came to mind was the Konohana family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuuuu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka sulked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you can, don&#8217;t tell anyone about this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I know. Being an adopted child is a fragile position]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were other reasons for keeping it a secret, but Naruka was able to make her own conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s all I have to say about me and Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, Naruka. Are you free after school?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After school? Yeah, I&#8217;m free]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, why don&#8217;t we talk in a cafe?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Talk in a cafe? C-Could it be a tea party!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, something like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ll join you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka&#8217;s eyes instantly lit up and said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ahhh, to tell you the truth, I&#8217;ve always wanted to go to a tea party! I&#8217;ve never had anyone to invite me to one I thought it&#8217;d be something that never happened until I graduate]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Is that so. That&#8217;s, um, hard for you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time I talk to Naruka, I feel even more pity for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, so far there&#8217;s only 3 participants besides us, Taisho, Asahi-san, and Konohana-san from class A]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh? T-there&#8217;s other people..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. It&#8217;s supposed to be my welcome party]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Welcome party, I see. From what I&#8217;ve heard, Itsuki just transferred the other day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that transfer students aren&#8217;t uncommon here, but rumors still circulate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka also seemed to know that I recently transferred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;d like to join but I&#8217;m nervous. I might not be able to speak well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You can talk to me just fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s because Itsuki knows the old me, and there&#8217;s no need for me to try and hide it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, isn&#8217;t it fine if you don&#8217;t keep up appearances to others?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I could, I wouldn&#8217;t have any trouble!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said as tears started welling up in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And this isn&#8217;t my personal problem either]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What do you mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Miyakojima family is quite big, if I do say so myself. Therefore, most students get intimidated by my family background. Not because I&#8217;m clumsy, but they&#8217;ve been frightened of me from the start]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s certainly not Naruka&#8217;s only problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In that aspect, Konohana-san is an amazing person. I don&#8217;t like to admit it, but I&#8217;m really envious of her popularity regardless of gender. Normally, with a family as big as the Konohana family, most students would step back. But even so, Konohana-san has been approached by many people without hesitation. I wonder how she can be like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said, as if she&#8217;s mocking herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure I know why Hinako is so popular. It&#8217;s her acting. Hinako is the perfect Ojou-sama, and she&#8217;s trying her best to give an all-too-familiar act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that fact can&#8217;t be known by the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don&#8217;t know why Konohana-san is so well liked but if you talk to her, you might find some clues]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah, you&#8217;re right. Itsuki&#8217;s also there, and I&#8217;d love to join you for tea after school]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if she&#8217;s gathering courage, Naruka clenched her fist and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[B-but, will it be fine? I don&#8217;t want them to think I&#8217;m unhappy or uncomfortable]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think we&#8217;ll be fine, maybe]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Maybe..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Absolutely]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cheered up Naruka, who was anxious, with a sigh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Asahi-san nor Taisho disliked Naruka. In particular, Asahi-san said that she tried approaching Naruka herself to deepen their friendship. If that&#8217;s the case, they wouldn&#8217;t mind Naruka&#8217;s participation.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to leave Naruka and go back to my class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the far end of the corridor, I heard 2 female students talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you very much!! That helped me out!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Your gratitude is unnecessary]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A student with golden hair and vertical roll replies to the bowing girl with an imposing attitude. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help but mention her name when I saw her conspicuous appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, you were that one]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyes of Tennouji-san squinted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of which, we had a sloppy farewell before. I quickly looked for something else to talk about, because it&#8217;d be bad if she was reminded of that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, what were you doing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not a big deal. They were carrying some materials for class, so I just helped her out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve thought of this before when she helped me get Hinako&#8217;s wallet, but regardless of her appearance, Tennouji-san is kind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she has been taking initiative to help others on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, I&#8217;ve heard about you. You are a transfer student, aren&#8217;t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. My name is Tomonari Itsuki, and I transferred the day before yesterday]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all this time, I remembered that I hadn&#8217;t introduced myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then Tomonari-san You seem to have come to school with Konohana Hinako. There&#8217;s a rumor going around]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah right, does Tennouji-san see Hinako as an enemy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t want to be seen as an enemy, so I&#8217;ll make an excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The first day of school we went together, because I was shown around the school. But yesterday and today we went to school separately. Konohana-san and I only have parent relationship, nothing more]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder. Are you part of the Konohana faction?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana faction?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I tilted my head, Tennouji-san explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s just my own term. There are many students at the academy who worship Konohana Hinako, so it&#8217;s a general term for them]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s like a fan club. The academy is also surprisingly profane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Tennouji-san, do you dislike Konohana-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-It&#8217;s not like I disliked her! It&#8217;s just because of her, my true dignity is fading!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly in a panic, Tennouji-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I admire Konohana Hinako&#8217;s abilities. She&#8217;s as good as I am in both looks and grades. How can she not be popular?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A roundabout boasting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please share some of that confidence with Naruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But Konohana Hinako is being too pampered, and they put the Tennouji Group aside! The Tennouji Group is a business enterprise on a scale comparable to the Konohana Group, and its history is much deeper! In other words, it should&#8217;ve been me! The one at the center of the Kiou Academy!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glared at me as she declared firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you weren&#8217;t from the Konohana faction, you&#8217;d think so too, wouldn&#8217;t you?!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh? Yeah, well..]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s right!! I don&#8217;t like it at all! Why does she stand out more! I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s just a lazy person who lounges around when she gets home!] (TN: She just solved the whole plot, truly best girl)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She just casually guessed the truth. Let&#8217;s keep quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;After all, is it because she&#8217;s friendly? No, as someone of noble birth, she should be resolute and decisive like I am. Too much smiling can be detrimental for your dignity, and too much teaching what you don&#8217;t understand in your studies can be detrimental to your partner. Besides, she did it again the other day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then told Tennouji-san, who was mumbling by herself, what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san sure knows a lot about Konohana-san, doesn&#8217;t she?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What!? N-Not really, isn&#8217;t it normal!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The red-faced Tennouji-san denied with great exaggeration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Me and Konohana Hinako are rivals! Yes,we&#8217;re rivals! So it&#8217;s only natural to do research! It is said if you know your enemy and you know yourself, a hundred battles will not be lost] (TN: Sun Tzu reference, nice) (EDN: Sun Tzu, The Art of War if you didn&#8217;t know)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she was hurriedly explaining, I thought a little about Tennouji-san&#8217;s character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka was saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you carry a big family name, the people around you will step back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She carries the big family name of the Tennouji Group on her shoulders, but maybe she&#8217;s just as lonely as Naruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if it&#8217;s Hinako If it&#8217;s someone with the same family size she can surely establish an equal relationship. I wonder if Tennouji-san is aware and obsessed because of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… are you free after school today?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After school? Well, it certainly is vacant, but what for?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m planning to have a tea party at the cafe next to the cafeteria. By the way, Konohana-san will be there too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ko-Konohana Hinako too!?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-You are trying to make me soften up to the Konohana faction aren&#8217;t you..!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why are you so on guard..? I&#8217;m just inviting you normally]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s too conscious of Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-Well if that woman insists on me coming, I won&#8217;t have any choice but to join you, I guess?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, Konohana-san didn&#8217;t say anything]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Um, I think she did mention you after all, so can I ask you to join us?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Then it can&#8217;t be helped! I&#8217;ll join you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere became awkward, so I decided to give a white lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san&#8217;s eyes sparkled. She wanted to participate after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s said that if you know your enemy and you know yourself, a hundred battles won&#8217;t be lost]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that already.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, after school. Taisho and Asahi-san&#8217;s eyes lit up when they saw the group gathered at the cafe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I did say you could invite anyone and just do it but this is one hell of a group]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said as he scanned through the faces of the females gathered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of six, filled with 2 men and 4 women were gathered around a circular white table. In addition to the original members, Taisho, Asahi-san and me, I also brought Hinako, Naruka, and Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the three Ojou-samas have the temperament to be swayed by the atmosphere of the place. Hinako had a gentle smile on her face as her facade was on, Naruka was sitting next to her, wondering if she was going to do anything, and Tennouji-san was proudly sipping her tea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[H-Hey, Tomonari-kun, what kind of connections are these? How come you met such great people on the third day of being here..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you&#8217;re asking me why, it just happened]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Hinako, the reason I invited Naruka and Tennouji-san was because I thought it&#8217;d be a good opportunity to deepen our friendship respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, this was Tomonari-san&#8217;s welcome party, wasn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After placing her cup on the table, Tennouji-san looks at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s late, but first of all, let me congratulate you on your transfer. Although the academics here are stricter than normal schools, graduating from this school will certainly lead to a fruitful future. I look forward to your future successes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised, but I thanked her anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt happy when I heard that from Tennouji-san, who had an imposing appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ This is the first time I&#8217;ve spoken to some of you, so let&#8217;s introduce ourselves again. I&#8217;m Tennouji Mirei, I&#8217;m the daughter of the Tennouji Group]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho and Asahi-san followed Tennouji&#8217;s lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My name is Taisho Katsuya. My family is in the transportation business]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m Asahi Karen. My family is in the retail business but I guess their main business is electronics retail stores]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following them, Hinako and Naruka also introduced themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m Konohana Hinako. Nice to meet you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I&#8217;m Miyakojima Naruka. Nice to meetsh you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She bit her tongue but I pretended not to notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako and Tennouji-san&#8217;s expressions didn&#8217;t change. Either they didn&#8217;t notice, or they didn&#8217;t care. On the other hand, Taisho and Asahi-san had a strange look on their faces. Their faces said &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think Miyakojima-san would bite her tongue&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My name is Tomonari Itsuki. My parents run an IT company]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I&#8217;ll tell them my name and family business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After everyone finished introducing themselves, Tennouji-san opened her mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As I said earlier, there&#8217;s no need to worry about my family history. You can use your usual tone of voice. Taisho-san and Asahi-san had a slightly more frank tone, didn&#8217;t they?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh w-well, what&#8217;s the point if they know?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha, I guess so. Well, I guess I&#8217;ll just do what I always do]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two of them looked awkward for a moment, but quickly relaxed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Tennouji-san looks at Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san, what coincidence to meet you here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m always indebted to Tennouji-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Is that sarcasm?] (TN: Tennouji.exe stopped working) (EDN: Rebooting initiated)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san gave a twitchy smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hinako didn&#8217;t seem to notice this and was drinking her tea in a leisurely manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka and Tennouji-san are both beautiful girls, but Hinako has a special elegance unique to her. The sight of her sipping her cup gracefully drew the gaze of everyone present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[U-Um! Konohana-san! I&#8217;m in the same class as you. Did you know that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My, of course, Asahi-san. Thank you for always being the mood maker of Class A. Thanks to you, I feel the classroom is comfortable every day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ahaha, you&#8217;re welcome. Wow, geez. I&#8217;m really happy to hear that from Konohana-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san tried to desperately hide her grinning face with her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-What about me! Do you know me!? Konohana-san!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course, I know you too, Taisho-san. I think your friendly attitude towards everyone is very admirable]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-oh! I feel like I&#8217;m getting a lot of virtue right now!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think he is, but he looked very happy, as if he rose to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gununu… why didn&#8217;t they ask me anything!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hinako kept all the attention to herself, Tennouji-san was clearly in a bad mood. I think it was simply the way the conversation went, but I&#8217;ll change the topic just in case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has Naruka ever talked to any of the people here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yeah. I&#8217;ve only participated in a minimal number of off-campus events]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way you say the minimum amount, do they hate you that much..?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was muttering to myself, I noticed that everyone was staring at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Naruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone said, they were bothered by the fact that I was calling Naruka by her first name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if I should&#8217;ve explained the relationship between me and Naruka first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[M-Me and Itsuki have met before when we were ten years old. It was through that connection that I was invited to this tea party]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Heee~ I didn&#8217;t know that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san was surprised by Naruka&#8217;s explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka fell flat on her face. She was simply embarrassed, but her expression was stern and some onlookers might think she was in a bad mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the one who invited Naruka here. So I&#8217;ll follow up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think people misunderstand her, Naruka isn&#8217;t that scary. She seems to have spent most of her childhood in her house, so she&#8217;s just not very good at communicating]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. And all the rumors are a lie]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I assure Asahi-san, whose eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Itsuki..!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka was so moved she had tears in her eyes. I hope this will be a good opportunity for Naruka to make some friends </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As I recall, Miyakojima-san&#8217;s family was a sporting goods manufacturer, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san asked Naruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yeah. T-That&#8217;s well you know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please be humble. There is no student in this school who does not know the Miyakojima family. The rumor in question can be easily denied with a little research. I don&#8217;t see you at many social gatherings, how do you usually spend your time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[U-Usually I usually spend time at home, training]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Training?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, there&#8217;s a dojo in our house. That&#8217;s where I usually sweat everyday. Nowadays, I&#8217;m often asked to try out samples for home products]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. You seem to be living a very fruitful and fulfilling life]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to them, Asahi-san and Hinako were conversing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I would like to ask a question to Konohana-san, how do you usually spend time at home? Do you study all the time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Studying is important, but so is relaxation. I read and sometimes I eat sweets and rice cakes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh~, so you like sweets too, Konohana-san? What kind of sweets do you eat?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm… Scones for example]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullsh*t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All you like are potato chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come to think of it, do Konohana-san and Tomonari-kun have a family connection?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san asked Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. My father and Tomonari-kun&#8217;s father know each other]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You two hadn&#8217;t met until recently?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right. But now we&#8217;re close enough to sit together like this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hinako replied with a smile, Asahi-san said [Hmm~] happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Something&#8217;s fishy here~ Are you sure that&#8217;s all that is between you two~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oi oi, Asahi. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a good idea]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said with a bitter smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah but… The connection between parents is like a sign for arranged marriage, and it&#8217;s the standard for a love affair. Maybe you two are already in such a relationship..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, I could tell from the tone of voice it was just a joke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in response to Asahi-san&#8217;s question, Hinako said nothing and slowly drank her tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oi, what&#8217;s with the sudden silence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also felt a meaningful silence. Asahi-san, who had been jokingly asking, gradually turned serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san wrinkled her brows and wondered. And Naruka was staring at me with a blue pale face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, that that&#8217;s not true]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako doesn&#8217;t want to answer, so I&#8217;ll do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not that we have a special relationship, as Konohana-san said earlier, it&#8217;s just that our parents were acquainted. Moreover, me and Konohana-san aren&#8217;t an even match]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one hand, she&#8217;s the daughter of a famously known group, the Konohana Group, and on the other hand, is the heiress of a medium-sized company. Even my status is enough to make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, whether it&#8217;s an even match or not Tomonari-kun, you&#8217;re still having troubles with your studies right now. Isn&#8217;t that the case?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s about right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I smiled at Asahi-san&#8217;s words, Naruka turned her to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuuu… liar]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka muttered in a voice only I could hear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as she keeps her mouth shut, she seems to accept that she will not spread my relationship, but she still feels dissatisfied by the fact that I work for the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, things are generally going well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka seems to have adapted to the group safely, and Tennouji-san is friendly, except for her relationship with Hinako. I&#8217;m glad that I invited them both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I relaxed and drank my tea on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I got a look from Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san. When you drink tea, it looks better if you hold the cup closer to the mouth instead of the other way around, you know?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I see… Thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I&#8217;m not careful, I&#8217;ll be found out in no time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look closely, you&#8217;ll see that everyone except me was drinking tea with such a gesture. I have to reflect on this. I remind myself that I&#8217;m different, that I&#8217;m here under a false pretense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did Tomonari go to a normal school before he came here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. So I&#8217;m a little unsure about etiquette]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head in response to Taisho&#8217;s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When I was a freshman, a friend in my class told me that normal schools have a lot of interesting cultures. For example, Warikan] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Warikan?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho tilted his head at Asahi-san&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone looked at me strangely. It seems I have to explain to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Warikan is basically, paying for the things you bought while splitting the expenses with your friends. Don&#8217;t the students do that here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don&#8217;t. Wouldn&#8217;t it be faster if someone just paid for it all at once?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s true, but wouldn&#8217;t that mean you&#8217;d have to buy me a full round of drinks?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If it bothers you, you can pay for it next time, but basically you shouldn&#8217;t care about buying a drink or being bought a drink. Whoever invited you, or whoever wants to pay, should pay for it, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if I should care too much when I&#8217;m buying a drink. (TN: The drink they&#8217;re talking about are vending machine drinks) (EDN: Something that seems to be sadly lacking in some countries like mine)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, there was…. Was it something called borrowing without returning?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah yeah. That&#8217;s the kind of thing where you steal when borrowing something, right? I wonder why they don&#8217;t just buy it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-No, that isn&#8217;t a culture]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I break in between Taisho and Asahi-san&#8217;s conversation to correct their knowledge. It&#8217;s not uncommon for us commoners to do that, but even if we do, it&#8217;s usually accidental.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Didn&#8217;t your previous school have anything like that, Tomonari?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I could tell that they were genuinely curious, I tried to think of something that&#8217;d be interesting for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How about the 3 second rule?] (TN: ah yes, the classic)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3 second rule?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san tilted her head. No one else seemed to know, so I continued my explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The rule is that if you drop a food and pick it up within 3 seconds, it&#8217;s still edible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-what the hell is that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not that big of a deal but It&#8217;s faster to show it huh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I picked up one of the baked goods in the middle of the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;d be a shame if I dropped it all, so I nibbled half of it to make it smaller. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you drop something like this when eating]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I purposely dropped the pastry on the table and quickly picked it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The rule is that if you pick it up in 3 seconds, you can still eat it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huuuh… you think of interesting things]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you stupid..?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, they&#8217;re not stupid, but I honestly don&#8217;t think I should be impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is normally bad manners. (TN: IMPORTANT PLOT)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to tell them that they shouldn&#8217;t do it too much when-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Would it be like this?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who sits in front of me, imitates me and drops a pastry on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She began to pick it up and chew again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, something like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I affirm in a shaky voice to Hinako, who was smiling adorably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the room was surprised to see Hinako, who was so beautiful and full of grace, behave in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Tennouji-san coughed and cleared her throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Commoners do think of something interesting from time to time, but I don&#8217;t think this 3 second rule is something proper]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san says after putting her cup on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But actually, I can understand why you might think this rule isn&#8217;t a problem. I think I&#8217;ll try that when I get the chance]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s probably a hygiene issue. I&#8217;m sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san chided me. She wasn&#8217;t serious, and quickly replied [Well, you&#8217;re right].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tea party then went on without a hitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The memorable first tea party ended peacefully without any problems.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the cafe, we walked straight to the school gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were several black colored cars waiting in front of the gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sorry for making you wait, Ojou-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh cmon, stop with the Ojou-sama thing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san chuckled and got into the car driven by the servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little later, Taisho got into the same car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hm? Are you and Asahi-san always together?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. Asahi and I live close to each other, and we&#8217;ve known each other for a long time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The servants in our houses take turns welcoming us and taking us home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like the predetermined relationship between me and Hinako, Asahi-san and Taisho also seem to have a family connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, we&#8217;ll excuse ourselves first]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I had a good time today. See you tomorrow]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car carrying the two of them went away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby, Tennouji-san&#8217;s car was also waiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have to go]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Tennouji-san slightly bowed her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Tennouji-san, there were several servants dressed in suits. Unlike Asahi-san&#8217;s servants, this one was casually keeping an eye on the surroundings like an SP. (TN: SP is Security Police)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ko-Konohana Hinako!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Tennouji-san who called out to Hinako in a tense manner, Hinako just had her usual soft and gentle smile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the first time I&#8217;ve had a private tea party with you but it wasn&#8217;t too bad! The next time, it would be great if we could talk a little more in-depth about your studies and family business!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. If we could get a chance, I&#8217;d love to]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san made a promise to come back next time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After smiling happily, Tennouji-san quickly pulled herself together and looked at me this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ehem, and Tomonari-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coughing intentionally, Tennouji-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You had your back straight today. It&#8217;s much more attractive than before]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard those words, I stiffened for a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t expect to be complimented, so my reaction was delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a giggle and a smile on her face, Tennouji-san turned around and got into her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You two get along quite well, don&#8217;t you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s kind of a social praise]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, Tennouji-san is an honest person. You can take it as an honest compliment. Even though, it&#8217;s only your third day, it&#8217;s impressive getting a compliment from Tennouji-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka was somewhat frustrated as she told me this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Tennouji-san, Naruka doesn&#8217;t seem to praise me honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work, Ojou-sama, Itsuki-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, two black cars pulled up nearby, and I was approached by someone from inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Shizune-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, dressed in her maid outfit, appeared in front of us and bowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You must be Miyakojima Naruka-sama. My name is Tsurumi Shizune, a servant in the Konohana family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka, who didn&#8217;t expect to be called, jumped in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve already heard about the circumstances from Itsuki-sama. As for our family, Itsuki-sama&#8217;s family is  a close business partner of ours, so we would appreciate it if you could keep quiet of this matter]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ah! I&#8217;ve heard about this from Itsuki, and I trust him. I won&#8217;t tell anyone, so no need to worry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san bowed reverently. Apparently, Shizune-san went out of her way to appear in front of us in order to talk about this matter again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka knows that I work for the Konohana family, so when me and Hinako ride home in the same car, Naruka won&#8217;t have any doubts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has Naruka been picked up yet?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh. They should be here by now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Naruka became quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka takes her phone out of her pocket and puts it on her ear. There seems to be a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Naruka ended the call and let out a small gasp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What&#8217;s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, it seems there&#8217;s traffic and my pick-up is a little late. Fortunately, they seem to be close by, and I&#8217;ll head there myself, so Itsuki and the others can go home first]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she says to go home first</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who has been recently involved in kidnapping, I&#8217;m a little concerned about leaving Naruka alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san. I&#8217;m going to take Naruka home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told them, Shizune-san and Naruka&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Naruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sure your car is close by, right? I&#8217;ll go with you until there]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-That&#8217;s fine with me, but is that okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my gaze towards Shizune-san, Shizune-san nodded as if she understood my intention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. Due to Ojou-sama&#8217;s busy schedule, we will return to the mansion first. We will have a replacement waiting for you, so please use that one, Itsuki-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san then looks at Hinako, who got into the car first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You don&#8217;t mind, Ojou-sama?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako replied with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thanked her and decided to send Naruka back.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the car pulled away from the academy, Hinako let out a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m so tired]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stopped her facade and let out a lazy sigh. She then turned around on her knees in the back seat and looked out the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muu… Itsuki&#8217;s getting along with others]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you didn&#8217;t want that, you shouldn&#8217;t have allowed it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is it fine to keep him all for myself?] (TN: she&#8217;s going the deep route rn </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweats</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s a gaffe. It would be unnatural if Ojou-sama denied Itsuki-sama while in that state]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itsuki&#8217;s idea of sending Naruka home was gentlemanly. The perfect Ojou-sama can&#8217;t let her selfishness prevent him from doing so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Shizune. Do you know what the 3 second rule is?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako asked with a smug look on her face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought that she could tell her, since she wouldn&#8217;t know, however-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, I know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eeehh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Because of that famous misunderstanding, there has been a great amount of research on that subject. A woman who was a high school student in the U.S. at the time is famous for her research that won her the lg Nobel Prize. But that was actually the 5 second rule] (EDN: For those who don&#8217;t know, the Ig Nobel Prize is an award for unusual or trivial research)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By all accounts, Shizune knew more than Hinako. Hinako was just overly sulking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune gave a small smile to Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Truly, ever since Itsuki-sama arrived Ojou-sama has changed]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama has attended several tea parties in the past, but all of them were under the order of Keigon-sama. Isn&#8217;t this the first time Ojou-sama has attended a tea party on her own?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm… I think, that&#8217;s true]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako says in a small voice as if she doesn&#8217;t care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune casts a worried glance at Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama. How are you feeling?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It&#8217;s soon]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako answered languidly.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Waaaaa~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the car with Hinako drove away, Naruka exhaled deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What&#8217;s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it&#8217;s just I finally got to relax my shoulders]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she felt relieved and her tension was finally lifted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You said you weren&#8217;t good at talking to people, but you were able to talk just fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not like I have control over it. I&#8217;ve had a lot of help from a lot of different people, I just managed to hold on]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess that&#8217;s true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san and Tennouji-san were especially attentive to Naruka. Asahi-san always tried to liven up the conversation so that Naruka could join in, and Tennouji-san tried to draw Naruka in by asking her questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… Really, thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Naruka thanked me in a refined manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If it weren&#8217;t for Itsuki, I&#8217;m sure I would&#8217;ve been a loner till graduation]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That&#8217;s not true. I just helped out a little, that&#8217;s all]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I know what I&#8217;m talking about. Today was a life-changing day for me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Naruka looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After all, Itsuki is my hero. When I was little, he taught me about the outside world and this time, he saved me from my loneliness]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s an exaggeration. I didn&#8217;t intend to make it to such a big deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s unfair]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka lowered her gaze and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Unfair. Unfair, unfair, unfair!! Konohana-san is unfair!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Still on about that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course! I&#8217;ll say it again and again! Because, it&#8217;s just too much! Why are you at Konohana-san&#8217;s house when we just had a chance to meet again!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That being said it&#8217;s just convenient for my parents]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kuuuh! I know you said you had an apprenticeship, but what else do you do!? Don&#8217;t tell me you also work there!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I guess. But it&#8217;s just taking care of the surroundings]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san doesn&#8217;t need to care about her surroundings! Isn&#8217;t she perfect from the beginning!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m in a pinch because she&#8217;s not. Of course, I can&#8217;t say that, so I&#8217;ll just shut my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;When does the apprenticeship end?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I don&#8217;t know about that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Then, why don&#8217;t you come to my house after you&#8217;re done? See, Itsuki must&#8217;ve missed our time together too, right!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I certainly do, but it will be difficult since I&#8217;m scheduled to be employed until graduation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whenever I feel like it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s just flattery, isn&#8217;t it!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not Tennouji-san, so I can at least flatter someone one or two times.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s the end of today&#8217;s training. Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-thank you for your help]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Konohana family dojo, I answered, dripping with sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lessons were not cancelled on the day of the tea party. Rather, the lessons were more packed, so I was very exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki~ Bath~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time. The door to the dojo opened and Hinako appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It&#8217;s that time already?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time was 10 p.m. I worked up quite a sweat, so I also wanted to head to the bathroom, but</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama. Could I ask you to go back to your room first so I can talk to Itsuki-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn okay. Hurry up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako nodded at Shizune-san&#8217;s words and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A talk, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Well, I&#8217;m not going to take up too much of your time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said with a hesitant look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don&#8217;t want to keep Ojou-sama waiting, so I won&#8217;t go into detail but Ojou-sama&#8217;s health hasn&#8217;t been good lately, so please be careful just in case, Itsuki-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Health, huh? She looked fine at the tea party]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I overdo it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Strictly speaking, I think she will be ill in the near future]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head, not understanding the meaning of her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s fine if you&#8217;re careful. Now, Itsuki-san, please head to Ojou-sama&#8217;s room]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, Shizune-san began cleaning up the dojo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t understand the conversation, but I&#8217;ll keep an eye out for it because she said to be careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After entering Hinako&#8217;s room and changing into a swimsuit, I went into the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh it&#8217;s Itsuki~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Sorry to keep you waiting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I approached Hinako, who&#8217;s already inside, and quickly washed her hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are there any itches?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nope]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washing Hinako&#8217;s hair became a daily routine, and I was also learning from Shizune-san about how to wash her hair as well. Warm the scalp with hot water collected in the hand, and wash with shampoo carefully. Then, take the conditioner and rub it into your hand and let it soak through the hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;But, Shizune-san also made something amazing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I washed Hinako&#8217;s hair, I looked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A private shower room was set up there. It&#8217;s like having a bathroom inside a bathroom. Shizune-san said &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t be able to wash your bodies with swimsuits on&#8221;, so she  prepared a shower room so we can wash it ourselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, can you get the bucket there?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oke~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you making a joke with &#8220;Ok&#8221; and &#8220;bucket&#8221;..? (TN: Bucket in Japanese is &#8220;Oke&#8221;, and it took me a while for this)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ask Hinako to get the bucket, which I&#8217;m not sure was filled with water or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hinako dropped the bucket midway back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sound of it dropping echoed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako quickly picked it up as if she had an idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3 second rule]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well, I guess so]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t know how to respond to the smug Hinako. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is interesting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When you say it like that, it makes it all worthwhile]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would prefer her not doing it in public though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After you left me today… What did you talk about with Miyakojima-san..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No matter what you say &#8220;I just had a good time at the tea party&#8221;, normally. That&#8217;s about it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hmmm]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly convinced, Hinako changed the subject</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki is my caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a small voice, Hinako muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;don&#8217;t go anywhere]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice was so small that I couldn&#8217;t understand what she was saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when I asked back, she didn&#8217;t answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako&#8217;s body slowly fell over to me. I suddenly was in close contact with her and became shaken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[H-Hey, you&#8217;ll catch a cold if you stay too long]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said, shaking her body slightly. But Hinako didn&#8217;t answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly something was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked at her face, Hinako was dripping with sweat and letting out painful moans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hinako collapsed in the bathroom, I immediately carried her body to my room and called Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, I thought she was being overzealous, but her breathing was ragged and heavy. After wiping Hinako&#8217;s body, I asked Shizune-san to confirm her condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A mild fever]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said as she gazed at Hinako lying on the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[First of all, let&#8217;s let Ojou-sama sleep in her room]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san already had the tools to take care of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was out of the room, Shizune-san quickly changed Hinako into nightwear, and then gave her a tablet of medicine to drink with water. The familiarity of her actions made me feel a small sense of difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What&#8217;s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it&#8217;s just you&#8217;re very calm]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Because this happens on a regular basis]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Regular basis..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san answers my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The reason to her collapse is because of her acting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a while, I couldn&#8217;t understand what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Stress from acting, could be from her keeping up an act every single day?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. If you&#8217;re acting out of character so much. It&#8217;s natural to feel stressed]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san tells me in a straightforward manner. Those words gave me a shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, Hinako always acts on a daily basis. However, as soon as she returns home, she would immediately revert to her normal lazy personality. She looked like she was having a hard time, but didn&#8217;t seem to be in any pain. I knew stress would accumulate while acting but I never imagined it would be until she collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wait, why are you being so casual about this? It&#8217;s built up to a burden to the point of collapse, right? There&#8217;s no way we can just overlook this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even if she does collapse, the fever will go away in a few days. There&#8217;s no need to worry so much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, but, if she&#8217;s going to collapse like this, she might as well stop act]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You need to know how to behave yourself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san&#8217;s eyes flashed sharply and she glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the consensus of the Konohana family. It&#8217;s not something that can be dealt with personal emotions and of course Ojou-sama is aware of this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako knows this. Those words repeated in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of acting is for Hinako to collapse. She&#8217;s knowingly acting to the point of collapse. So who am I supposed to be mad at? Where do I direct these feelings?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When she&#8217;s out in public, she focuses on her performance. That&#8217;s why, when she&#8217;s in the mansion, she drops it for the sake of relaxation and rest. It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that the reason Ojou-sama is lazy when home is because of the fatigue and exhaustion due to acting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;So you&#8217;re saying that Hinako being lazy was recoil from all the acting, when she&#8217;s out in public?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right. Of course, this is her real personality but… She gets more energetic when it&#8217;s on holidays where she doesn&#8217;t have to act]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew nothing. I had no idea Hinako had such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san. If you don&#8217;t go to bed soon, it will affect classes tomorrow]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I&#8217;ll still be going to school while Hinako is sick?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. Considering Itsuki-san&#8217;s academic skills, it&#8217;s best to not be absent as much as possible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, I&#8217;m Hinako&#8217;s caretaker and…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The right person in the right place. I&#8217;m well versed in what to do when Ojou-sama collapses]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Shizune-san looked me straight in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will concentrate on taking care of her, so please go back to your room, Itsuki-san]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, I went to the academy by myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Tomonari! We had a blast yesterday!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I sat down in the classroom, Taisho called out to me innocently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I spoke to Taisho, Asahi-san arrived as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, Konohana-san didn&#8217;t show up today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah well, maybe the usual]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Asahi and Taisho-san&#8217;s conversation, I tilted my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The usual?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Tomonari doesn&#8217;t know. Konohana-san sometimes takes a break from the academy. I heard that she helps out with the family business. Konohana-san must be working hard]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho told me, and I thought about it, while giving him an appropriate response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Hinako&#8217;s periodic collapses are a secret from her classmates. It may as well be kept a secret from everyone in the academy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then no one is going to worry about Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Hinako is hiding her true self by putting on a facade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who in the world would stand by Hinako&#8217;s side?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Hinako is having a hard time, who&#8217;s going to be close by and help her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With mixed feelings, more students arrived at the academy and school started.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, sitting in the passenger seat, calls out to me as I get into the pick-up car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Hinako gone, I occupied the spacious back seat all by myself. However, I didn&#8217;t feel good about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san. How is Hinako..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She&#8217;s still resting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, she hasn&#8217;t recovered yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;How long would it take for her to recover?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right Well, by the looks of it, she would likely recover by tomorrow or the day after. Fortunately, tomorrow is a day off, so she should be okay by Monday] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank goodness it&#8217;s Friday. No it&#8217;s not. On Monday, Hinako has to go to the academy again. In other words, she has to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is this happening..?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of the person who surely knows the answer passed into the back of my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… Is Keigon-san not coming?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked, Shizune-san replied while looking at the front of the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Keigon-sama is at work. He is at the main residence]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, he knows Hinako collapses, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Keigon-sama is the head of the Konohana group. He is not in a position to simply stop work just because Ojou-sama has fallen ill]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, I thought it was a bit cowardly to emphasize how different of a world we live in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t understand their common sense. No matter what they say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, what about Hinako&#8217;s mother..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a short pause, Shizune-san answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;She has already passed away]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer was surprising. Looking back, Hinako&#8217;s mother has never been mentioned. If she had already passed away, it would certainly be difficult to talk about her mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;..I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also something I didn&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s obvious, I haven&#8217;t been a caretaker for very long. Of course I wouldn&#8217;t know a lot of things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, her father, Keigon-san, is unable to visit, and her mother has already passed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, how many people can stand by and support the suffering Hinako?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if I could be one of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Um. Can we cancel today&#8217;s lesson?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don&#8217;t think so. Itsuki-san still has more to learn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If so, please let me finish earlier than usual. I&#8217;ll do my best to make up for it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Shizune-san widened her eyes slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand. Then let&#8217;s do it 1.5 times faster than usual]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like a hellish schedule, but I can&#8217;t turn my back on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving at the mansion, Shizune-san was very harsh on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparation, review, etiquette training, self-defense. I was tired to the point of headaches after finishing everything faster than usual, but as a result, I was able to get 2 hours of free time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That finishes today&#8217;s training]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you… Very much. May I go to Hinako&#8217;s room?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s not a problem. I will be on my way later, so please take care of her]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the dojo, I went to my room for a quick wash and then went to Hinako&#8217;s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako&#8217;s room was dimly lit by an orange night light. I approached the bed where Hinako was sleeping, watching my step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… it&#8217;s Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who was laying down, noticed my presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry. Did I wake you up?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s fine… I&#8217;ve just been spacing out for a while now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Shizune-san, she slept almost the whole day, so she must&#8217;ve had enough sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsu.. Ki. Thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Hinako thanked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m glad you came]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It&#8217;s obvious. I&#8217;m your caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ehehe]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who looked anxious and lonely, gave a smile of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let me know if there&#8217;s anything you want me to do]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Hinako turned towards me and opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Okay, hold my hand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako slowly held out her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No problem]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did as she asked and held her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very small hand. Hinako&#8217;s hand, which was more noble and better than anyone else&#8217;s at the academy, was so thin, small, and fragile it seemed like it could break with a single touch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Did you sleep?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let out a rhythmic sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holding her hand, I looked around. Being alone in such a large room could increase the sense of loneliness. It&#8217;s also common that sick people get lonely easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why someone has to be there to take care of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m the right person to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a thought crossed my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if Hinako really feels at ease with me by her side. Even if I am her caretaker, it&#8217;s still just a job. I don&#8217;t know how Hinako really feels about me. (TN: she doesn&#8217;t either, for now)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A replaceable follower. A convenient servant. I&#8217;d like to believe that I&#8217;m not seen like that. However, the feeling of distance and detachment is present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I just overthinking now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least I know that she&#8217;s relying on me right now.</span></p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3fsQ58q/index-206-1-733x1024.jpg" alt="index-206-1-733x1024" border="0"></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, for now, I&#8217;ll just have to live with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako… it&#8217;s okay]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako&#8217;s amber colored hair was sticking to her forehead with sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I brushed her hair lightly to the side and patted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hinako giggled and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Papa]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard her mutter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understood my role as her caretaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know what Hinako thinks of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the strange distance we&#8217;ve had now made sense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako must be yearning for family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered what I&#8217;ve been doing for her. I remember the lap pillow, taking a bath with her, and now I&#8217;m sure, Hinako is looking for the warmth of a family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I know that feeling]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked to myself as I stroked Hinako&#8217;s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Family is something you long for, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reminds me of my own family. Both of my parents are hopelessly lazy people, but because of that, their kindness and gentleness at a moment&#8217;s notice, will always be in my memories. When I was injured, they took care of me. They would also buy me a cake on my birthday. Although I still resent the fact I was left alone while they fled in the middle of the night, those memories aren&#8217;t lost to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the daughter of the Konohana family, Hinako always lived separate from her own family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother already passed away and her father, Keigon-san, always works at the main residence, so he&#8217;s rarely seen. Instead, there are many servants in the mansion, all of whom were hired by Keigon-san. Hinako, who doesn&#8217;t like their formal atmosphere, probably didn&#8217;t fit well with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice called out to me. When I turned around, I saw Shizune-san standing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How is Ojou-sama doing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;She just fell asleep]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san looked at the sleeping Hinako, and gave a small nod.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san. May I ask you to leave the room for a moment? I have something important to discuss with you.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san asked me with a serious expression, so I decided to comply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as I was about to stand up, Hinako grabbed my hand tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I silently make eye contact with Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;We have no choice. Let&#8217;s talk about it here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Please do]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to Shizune-san, who said in a small voice, with a complicated expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s about the situation of the Konohana family. Do you remember what Keigon-sama told you before the reason why Ojou-sama is acting?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I recall, the Konohana Group&#8217;s economy is in bad shape, and we&#8217;re trying to find a good fiance for Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right. But that would only be the second objective]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Second objective?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san answered my question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The main reason why Ojou-sama&#8217;s acting, is to welcome an adopted son-in-law into the Konohana family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to be a fiance, but rather, to receive a son-in-law. In other words, when a man is invited to the Konohana family as a son-in-law for Hinako?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Konohana family has a legitimate heir. He is the eldest son of Keigon-sama, Takuma Konohana. the older brother of Ojou-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Older brother… is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. However, they are older siblings and hardly know each other. Takuma-sama began living in a different residence when Ojou-sama was 5 years old]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, her brother is as distant from Hinako as her father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Takuma-sama, however, has been questioning whether he&#8217;s worthy as a successor of the Konohana Group. If he does not become the heir, then it will be passed to a son-in-law]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stories connect. The reason they&#8217;re searching for a son-in-law is for him to become an heir.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Konohana family is not only represented by the head of the family, but also by the wife of the head of the family. In other words, if the son-in-law is chosen as the heir, Ojou-sama will also be deeply involved with the work of the Konohana family in the future. It&#8217;s with this future in mind that Ojou-sama acts every day. Since she will eventually lead the Konohana Group together with the head of the family, she must be perfect and have a personality that will be respected by others. If she has a bad reputation, there will be friction within the Konohana Group. This friction could spread to the point where it could affect the company&#8217;s fortunes and cause many casualties]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Shizune-san looked at Hinako&#8217;s face as she slept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Konohana Hinako is no ordinary girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Konohana family&#8217;s total assets are approximately 300 trillion Yen. Everyone who lives in this country knows the Konohana Group, a financial conglomerate. She is the sole daughter of this influential Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Do you understand? What Ojou-sama is carrying on her shoulders]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other day, I felt compelled to help Hinako simply because she was suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure that idea isn&#8217;t wrong. But before that, I should understand Hinako&#8217;s situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Am I not allowed to do anything?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If Itsuki-san is willing to help Ojou-sama, I have no right to stop him]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I widened my eyes in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But yesterday, you told me to behave myself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. That&#8217;s why, please be reasonable and support Ojou-sama. That is the role of a caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san looked me straight in the eye, turned around, and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After watching the door quietly close, I turn my attention back to Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Support Hinako to a reasonable extent]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I repeat Shizune-san&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several conditions that must be met for Hinako to stop acting in public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, Hinako&#8217;s brother, Takuma, must take over the Konohana family. If this happens, Hinako will marry into another family and will not be involved in Konohana Group&#8217;s business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, even if the son-in-law takes over, Hinako should be in a position where she doesn&#8217;t need to be involved in the business. That way, when Hinako&#8217;s true nature is revealed, it will have less impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But neither is something I can do. After all, I&#8217;m just a hired hand. There&#8217;s no way I can overturn the guidelines and traditions of the Konohana Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The role of a caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are things I can do. I can do something to support Hinako as her caretaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The role of a caretaker is to protect Hinako&#8217;s reputation as the perfect Ojou-sama. In other words, they support Hinako behind the scenes to prevent her true nature from being exposed&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the words of Keigon-san. He said that the role of a caretaker is to protect her reputation. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, the role of a caretaker is to allow Hinako to take a break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heal Hinako, who is exhausted by her acting, as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become someone who Hinako can show her true self to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That I can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Let&#8217;s do it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance of Hinako, who is struck by fever, overlaps with her younger self, who was cared for by her parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who was sleeping while holding my hand, looked so adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to protect her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to be kind to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I need to be kind to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Hinako, with such a small body, is carrying something very large.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone has to be kind to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Hinako says she collapses from fatigue, then heal her from that fatigue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, I&#8217;ll give you the warmth of a family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako… I&#8217;ll do my best]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I swore as I clasped her small hands.</span></p>
