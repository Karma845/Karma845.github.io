			<h3>Prologue</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the top three prestigious schools in Japan &#8211; The Imperial Academy of Fine Arts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, the school’s alumni have become prime ministers, presidents of famous corporations, and other people who have played key roles in the nation’s central infrastructure, and even today, lots of children from wealthy families are enrolled there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students are almost always divided into two groups: politicians and businessmen. The content of the classes is inevitably advanced. At the Imperial Academy, there are always top-notch classes taught by top-notch teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even in such a school, there is still a caste system in place.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, there is one girl who reigns at the top of the Imperial Academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her total assets are about 300 trillion yen.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone in the country knows about the financial conglomerate family &#8211; the KonoHana Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is the daughter of the aforementioned group: Konohana Hinako.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san, have a good day.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Have a good day.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her amber hair fluttered in the wind, and she greeted them with a smile.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, she’s beautiful as always&#8230; Konohana-san.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll be happy for the rest of the year just by being in the same class as her&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl walked through the academy with her back straight, emitting a sense of elegance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Konohana-san! After school today, I’m holding a party at the garden. &#8230;If you’d like to join, please let me know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sounds wonderful. I’ll definitely participate.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san. There was something I didn’t understand in the class the other day&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If it’s something I can help with, I’ll be glad to.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has a beautiful appearance, is well educated, and is a good student. To some, she is known as the perfect young lady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is popular and always surrounded by people, and I was watching her from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, my friend, you’ve been watching Konohana-san again?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A male student sitting next to me called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Did I get caught?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Stop that. As expected, she’s an unattainable flower huh?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unattainable flower huh&#8230;　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only commoner in the academy, all the girls here are too high spec for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Anyways, we’re moving to the next class. I want to stop by the bathroom, so I’ll go first]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, my friend left the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s now recess time, and after all my classmates left the classroom, I slowly approached her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san, we need to get moving or we won’t make it in time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and I  were the only two people in the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl, who’s known as the perfect young lady, remained still and did not move a muscle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;My name]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;This is no time to be selfish. Come on, come on]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My name]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tone got stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made sure that there was no one around, and decided to comply with her request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako. Let’s get going]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, her face broke into a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ehehe~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was far from being a perfect lady, and looked full of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She slowly raised her upper body and turned her hands towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Carry me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Please don’t do that. What would you do if someone saw you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t mind&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll be killed by the Konohana family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said this, she pouted her lips.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t want to go to class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is a waste of time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I want to go home. I want to sleep. I want to eat potato chips]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll get you some chips when we get back to the mansion, just get moving]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nooo&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a sigh as she just wouldn’t move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no use. I’ll have to pull her out of the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was thinking, the door to the classroom suddenly opened with a bang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, you’re both still here? Next is moving classes, remember?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homeroom teacher said, looking at me and Hinako who remained in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, no, it’s just&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. I was talking to Tomonari-kun because I had some questions about the class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was struggling to come up with an excuse, she made up a situation.. The expression on her face was not that of a sweet, innocent girl, but of a perfect young lady known to the students of the academy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so? I’m impressed that you still study hard even during breaks]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher nodded satisfied with her response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong Tomonari-kun? Let’s head to the next class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, in front of other people, she carries out a perfect performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head and left the classroom with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not smart nor am I a genius, and my family is the exact opposite of wealthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did I, a plain, ordinary, commoner end up attending a prestigious school?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To know that, I need to explain what happened a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole thing started when I became the caretaker of Hinako Konohana.</span></p>
