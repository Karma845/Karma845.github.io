<h3>Chapter 1 : My Parents Ran Away At Night, And I Was Kidnapped</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good luck]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t expect to hear these words from my parents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At ten o’clock in the afternoon, my parents left our rundown apartment, which cost 20,000 yen, after saying a line that was most likely inspired from a Western movie or comic book. “Are they going to a pub or something? Well, They’ll be back by the time the sun sets..” I thought at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, after a few days, my parents never returned to the apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, I was abandoned. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You’re kidding me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not so much about me being abandoned, but the fact that they just ran away in the middle of the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, our family’s finances were in trouble, mostly because of my father’s alcohol addiction and my mother’s love of gambling. The reputation of our family has spread to the people around us, and our neighbors had witnessed my parents running away during the night. I finally understood what was going on when the neighbors told me that my parents ran off somewhere in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.I mean, tomorrow’s my first day of high school]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back at it now, the fact I’d been able to attend high school was a strange miracle in itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While taking care of my parents, I worked part time everyday so I earned enough money to pay for my tuition, and somehow, I was able to attend my second year&#8230; but I don’t know what my situation is now. What about rent? What about utilities? What about food? I’ve been living on my own money for the most part, but my parents had been paying some of the rent. I couldn’t suddenly bear all of that by myself.　</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Let’s go buy lunch.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let go of your thoughts.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clock struck four in the afternoon and I hadn’t taken a bite of anything since this morning. I searched all over the apartment, but there was no money left, so all I had was a couple of hundred yen in my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I talk to the police? Should I talk to my friends before that? No, I felt like I&#8217;d just get lost and confused if I tried to talk to anyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bright sun made me feel even more depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I walked through the familiar streets, I could hear voices talking from somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mm-hmm]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh my god, yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her back was very dignified (TN: we practically gave up) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked over to the direction of the voices and saw a pair of girls in neat school uniforms walking down a hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve heard about this particular hill. I’ve heard that one of the top three most prestigious schools in the country was at the top of the hill. It wasn’t your average school, but a school for the rich.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school is said to be full of children from wealthy families. The amount of prejudice was extremely high, the facilities were gorgeous, and the content of the classes were so refined it’s hard to believe it’s a high school. I heard that they lived a sophisticated life in many ways. My high school’s opening ceremony started tomorrow, but I guess that school had already started. Maybe prestigious schools don’t have long holidays.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[They live in a different world&#8230; the difference isn’t funny]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the way they walked was different. The goodness of their upbringing oozes out of them. I didn’t even feel jealous anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was unusual for students from that school to be walking in such a place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was after school now, and I was pretty sure that the children who go to that school were normally picked up by car. It was rare to see them in the city like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Hm?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way to the convenience store, I noticed something that looked like a business card case on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I picked it up and looked inside, it was a Student ID card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, one of the two girls from earlier had dropped it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana Hinako, huh&#8230; No, this is not the time to be checking names]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who dropped it was right in front of you. I shouldn’t bother checking their name or address. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I ran, I could easily catch up with the girl. I wondered if the friend she was with had left, because she was walking alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, excuse me!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to her, the girl turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her bright amber hair waved in the air, and the sunlight illuminated her neat and tidy profile. As I gazed at her, I thought, “This is what they call a beauty in retrospect”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[― Yes?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, a black lacquered car pulled up right next to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car door opened and two strong looking men emerged from inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no time, the men dragged her into the car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">― What was happening?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, what they were doing was obvious at first glance. It was just that it seemed unrealistic and I had only seen something of the sort happen in comics and dramas, so I was both surprised and astonished&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now was not the time to be confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right in front of my eyes, a kidnapping was taking place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wa-Wait a minute!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t turn a blind eye to them, so I shouted out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What the hell!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You know this girl?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair of men, who seemed to be kidnappers, shouted back at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, there was no one around but us. That’s why my shouting only served to agitate them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, we can’t leave a witness here! You! Come with me!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha&#8211;!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man grabbed me by the arm and pulled me into the car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, I was kidnapped along with the girl.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Alright, you can’t move with this. You guys stay put]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A petite man, who was one of the kidnappers, said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was currently in the back of an abandoned factory. The kidnapping seemed to have been planned well in advance, and the girl and I were both shackled with handcuffs and foot shackles. In addition, they were connected with thick chains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I don’t think my parents will be able to pay the ransom]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shut up. You’re just an extra]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper said as he spat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sigh escaped my mouth. My parents ran away during the night, and now, I was involved in a kidnapping. What did I do wrong in my previous life to deserve this&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My spirit was broken. I was in the dark anyways. No matter how the kidnapping ended, my future was nonexistent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re in luck, brother. She’s the daughter of the Konohana family. Isn’t she the biggest among the targets?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah&#8230; Speaking of the Konohana family, they’re considered rich even in that school range. We can squeeze a considerable amount of ransom out of them]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two kidnappers were discussing their catch, smiling at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I listened to them, I looked at the girl next to me, who was also handcuffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She could have been kidnapped for something other than ransom. She had a very good figure. Her eyes were dull and innocent, but there was a hint of intelligence in their depths, a combination of cuteness and intelligence. Her straight nasal bridge gave off a sense of elegance, and her vermillion lips with a hint of dampness gave off a sense of loveliness. Her light amber hair was silky and shiny, and her skin was as white and fine as the snow. Her arms and legs were also slender and long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hey]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl leaked out a voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her demeanor was a little&#8230; different from what I saw on the street. When I saw her on the street, she had the air of an Ojou-sama, but now she looked lazy and down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right — She had been kidnapped, so she must be scared. It’s only natural that she couldn’t act normally. Unlike me, she attended a prestigious school and had a promising future ahead of her. She must have been feeling much more scared compared to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though my future was dim, at least I might be able to comfort the girl in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried my best to choose my words and cheer her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure you’ll be fine. Kidnapping for ransom has a very low success rate, if I remember]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Toilet]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides, the Japanese police are good at what they do, so let’s just wait and&#8230; What?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did I hear that correctly?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like I heard a word that was very selfish just now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Toilet. It’s going to leak]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She showed her intention to urinate forcefully.</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even a well-mannered Ojou-sama was human. So it was natural that she would need to go to the bathroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But would you say that now? And while being so calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What should I do?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wait, I don’t understand what you mean…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s gonna leak]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard to tell because her tone was so blunt, but she was probably in trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to the small man in front of me, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sir! The Ojou-sama here wants to say something!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper tilted his head. She then said to the men without fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Toilet]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What about it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s going to leak]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnappers rolled their eyes, probably because of her unexpected response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This girl was not afraid at all!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you want to leak, just do it. I’ll be bothered if you make any strange moves]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper said in an annoyed tone</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She, on the other hand, was in no hurry to respond.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Really?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes were so pure and stylish. It seems that she won’t hesitate to pee. Even if you were a wild cat, you’d still pee with an apologetic face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I don’t think so. I want you to be patient. Please be patient&#8230; for my sake]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pointed it out to the kidnappers, who were very upright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and I were on a chain, so we couldn’t be too far apart. If she leaks her pants, I’ll also be affected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Go, take her]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The taller men of the kidnapper said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, brother&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know how many days we’ll be holed up. I don’t want to be dirty]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The words of his brother gave him a sense of satisfaction, and he scratched his head while approaching the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not taking off the chain]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnappers removed the shackles from me and the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl and I, who were still linked by chains, moved to the bathroom together. She entered the private room without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, the girl came out, washed her hands awkwardly, and then looked at me and the kidnapper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s clear]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ [No need to report it!] ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper and I shouted it at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a strange sense of exhaustion, we returned to our original location and we were shackled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She called out to the kidnappers once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What now?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tea]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you invincible?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnappers were stunned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, bro… Is this really the daughter of the Konohana family? It sure doesn’t look like it&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah&#8230; Did we kidnap the wrong  person? But that sort of thing is&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused, the bigger man approached the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, you. Aren’t you the only daughter of the Konohana family?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. What about the tea?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was too selfish. The kidnappers were also surprised to see her like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, fine. I’ll offer you a drink. I don’t want you to starve&#8230; In return, you have to be very cooperative]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper then placed a plastic bottle beside her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was only mineral water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I said tea though?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[HAH?! Don’t give me that luxury bullsh*t! Water is enough!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I want to drink tea. Also, some sweets and snacks]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl said, and a blue stripe appeared on the man’s forehead </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: When someone is mad, a line sometimes appears on their face)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey! You there! Take care of this woman!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why me!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We’re busy right now!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper yelled.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s not much I can do when I’ve lost the freedom of my hands and feet&#8230; Reluctantly, I shook my head.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey. What about the sweets?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;They don’t have any]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl picked up the bottle looking unsatisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, I heard the sound of spilling from her side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned towards her and saw her soaking wet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whoa?! Why are you so wet…]</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/B2NNtP0/Screenshot-20220715-123033.png" alt="Screenshot-20220715-123033" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tilting her head, the girl moved the bottle to her mouth. But due to the distance between her lips and the bottle’s mouth, the water ran down to her clothes instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you doing, it’s spilling!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not used to drinking plastic bottles&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not being used to drinking from plastic bottles. That itself puts you in a different dimension from the rest of the world you know..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if all rich girls in the world were like this. I’m not too sure if she went at her own pace or if she had nerves of steel&#8230; Even though she’s been kidnapped, she doesn’t seem to be afraid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll help you drink&#8230; Give me the bottle]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You don’t want it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t! You&#8217;re such a pain!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to my shout, the kidnappers turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought, “Oh no, I’ve ruined his mood!” &#8230;But he looked at me with sympathy. Stop looking at me like that. You were the one who brought us here in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s turning to a puddle, so we’re going to have to move]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl got up and moved with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, she tripped and fell over in the middle of nowhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It hurts]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl stood up with tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her forehead that hit the floor was dyed bright red. It seemed that she wasn’t athletically inclined. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, big brother&#8230; According to the information I got, the daughter of the Konohana family is called a perfect lady, right? I didn’t think it’d be such a dullard&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-No, but they look the same. I’ve never heard of another sibling&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnappers whispered to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the girl was rubbing her forehead that hit the floor, with tears welling in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It hurts&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Let me see]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl sounded so sad that I couldn’t help but check on her injuries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s more of a scrape than a cut. Don’t touch it too much, since you may infect it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nnn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl nodded, lowering the hand that had been placed on her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way&#8230; Why are you here?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl asked me a question in a carefree way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I was going to give you the student ID that you dropped. Then the kidnappers came and took me with them]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where’s my student ID?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What?&#8230;Oh yeah, I got it here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took out the girl’s student ID from my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the student ID card, the girl played with its surface with awkward movements. If you looked closely, you could see an out of place bulge in the lower right corner of the card. It looked as if a small button had been embedded in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl pushed the bulge with her nails.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Help should be arriving any minute now]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl then let out a “Huff” and a gasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sleep&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a thump, she laid down on the floor beside me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the girl lying there was staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is it okay to sleep?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pillow pillow~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was about to say “there’s none here,” she silently patted my knee. She probably wanted a lap pillow huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to pamper a pretty girl made my heart throb, but I’ve seen her helpless figure before, so I had some tolerance. The kidnappers told me to take care of her, so I sighed as I lent her my knee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm&#8230; A good height]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl muttered in satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Lullaby]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Sorry, but lullabies aren’t in my repertoire]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, tell me something interesting]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s unreasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, her boldness was so powerful that it blew away the gloomy atmosphere. Normally, I would have been so frightened that I would have burst into tears, but thanks to her, I was able to maintain my composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The other day, I was on the train with my friend&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It probably wasn’t interesting, but she kept quiet and listened to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, I heard a quiet sigh on my lap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to go to sleep easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You’re drooling too much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wiped the drool from her mouth with the hem on her outfit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nnn] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s okay] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl replied as she turned around.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My hair, it’s so stiff]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why don’t I tie it up for you? Just turn around]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tied her hair up into a ponytail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re kinda good at this, huh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uh… I used to do my mother’s hair]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmmm]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mother worked at a cabaret club for a while, and I used to help her set her hair before work. It’s something I don’t want to remember.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, one of the kidnappers kicked a nearby piece of wood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly a loud noise echoed and I jumped on my shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s enough!! If you drag this out any longer, I’ll beat your daughter to death!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidnapper was holding a phone to his ear, fuming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Stop provoking the kidnappers like you did before, or that will happen]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said to the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t worry. I think I can at least shield you when the time comes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if my future is dim, I can still help her.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I knew it was for my own self satisfaction, I felt a bit of relief as I comforted the girl.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Why would you do that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t going to bother telling her what happened to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled as gently as I could at the curious girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You, I like you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Somehow, it feels good. It smells like a freshly aired futon] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought that was the smell of dead mites?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not exactly happy to hear that&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have a lot of caretakers, but&#8230; They’re all too formal]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Huh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But you take it easy on me so I can also take it easy on you&#8230; I’m glad]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl smiled at me and made me fall in love with her for a moment.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s your name?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Tomonari Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I’m Konohana Hinako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl told me straightforwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You, are now going to be my-]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right after the girl was about to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something that looked like a can was thrown through the broken window of the facility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The can clanked, and in the next moment, it released white smoke all over the place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m going in—!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard a loud voice from the first floor of the facility. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, countless footsteps could be heard from everywhere around us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[D-Damn it! I can’t see anything!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When did these guys get close?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of police-like men appeared and quickly neutralized the kidnappers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The men immediately approached me and the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Freeze!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The men were hostile to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wait, wait! I&#8217;m a victim]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shut up! Be quiet!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Woah!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My head was pushed down and I was knocked to the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-sama! I&#8217;ve neutralized the third one!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sure there were two perpetrators&#8230; was the information about the scouting party incorrect?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the smoke curtain had cleared, a woman with the sound of steady footsteps  appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman had black hair that was stretched to her waist without being tied. She was dressed in a black and white frilly outfit, which was commonly called a maid&#8217;s uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My Lady, are you all right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Unn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid approached the girl on the floor and removed the handcuffs and shackles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of all the noise, the girl was unfazed. The girl yawned loudly, as if she had finally woken up from her sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m sorry for the delay in rescuing you. But&#8230; I keep telling you. When you go out, you have to take us in advance]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, it was too much trouble]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And as a result, this is what happens. &#8230;Goodness]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Quiet. This man is not a kidnapper]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the girl pointed at me, the maid rolled her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, my restraints were released.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ow, ow&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me sir. I thought you were one of the kidnappers]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He&#8217;s in custody, so he can&#8217;t be a kidnapper…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In some cases, the perpetrating group may have had a falling out. This often happens in long-term crimes such as kidnapping.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be&#8230; indeed, a possibility</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to say anything, I closed my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Leave the cleanup to them, and we&#8217;ll go home. You, too, please follow me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed they were going to show me the way out. I nodded silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the girl didn&#8217;t get up, and looked at me with an indifferent look in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Shizune]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl pointed at me and made a statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I want this person]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As you wish. I will make the arrangements as soon as possible]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid bows her head in reverence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrangements, for what?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wake me when we get there]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As you wish]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being ushered into the black car, the girl fell asleep immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl went to the far end of the back seat, followed by me, and finally the maid went in and closed the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fastened the seatbelt of the girl who had fallen fast asleep and fastened my own as well . Suddenly, I felt a gaze on me and when I turned around, I found the maid looking at me. The maid tightened her seatbelt and muttering in a small voice said, “I see, that&#8217;s why you like him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… Where are you guys taking me, what about those other guys?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You&#8217;ll see when we get there]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after the maid replied, I heard a small vibrating sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid took out her smartphone from her pocket and held it to her ear. After a minute of talking, the maid quietly put the phone away in her pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Your background check is complete]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Huh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki Tomonari is sixteen years old and a student at Ryuryu Miyagu High School. He has no brothers or sisters, and both of his parents are still alive&#8230; It is commendable that he has been able to earn his school fees on his own while taking care of his corrupt family. But five days ago, his parents ran away during the night and took all the money out of the house, so he is now in a critical situation]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Wh-Where did you get all this information from?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don&#8217;t underestimate the network of the Konohana family. This is no major feat]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid told him that as if it was a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, you were supposed to be a sophomore in high school starting tomorrow, but&#8230; you can no longer attend that high school]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The school tuition hasn’t been paid. It seems that your parents were planning to run away from home from the beginning. The money you earned by working part-time every day has already been withdrawn too.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How, no way&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that your rent and utility bills are being paid in arrears, and the house will soon be uninhabitable]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My home&#8230; was that bad already&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So we have a proposal for you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid said to me as I was dejected</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Would you be willing to work for Ojou-sama?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her suggestion was so unexpected that I tilted my head</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;m not sure I understand what you&#8217;re saying]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then let&#8217;s go through it step by step]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid opened her mouth, making a pretense of choosing her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Does the name &#8220;Konohana Group&#8221; sound familiar to you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It does]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s right. You have an account at Konohana Bank, so you must know about it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That&#8217;s what I was thinking. My part-time job is paid into an account I created at Konohana Bank.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The background check she just did was probably looking at the information registered on the account.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Konohana Group is not only a city bank, but also a well-known zaibatsu* business enterprise that includes major trading companies, heavy industries, real estate developers, and non-life insurance companies. Its total assets are about 300 trillion yen and its influence is felt not only in Japan, but also overseas]  (TN: zaibatsu is a Japanese word meaning &#8220;conglomerate&#8221;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid explained without a hint of hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And the one sleeping next to you is Konohana Hinako-sama, the ojou-sama of the Konohana Group. I&#8217;m one of the maids that serve her]</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pjfxkSy/Screenshot-20220715-123202.png" alt="Screenshot-20220715-123202" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, the girl sleeping next to me was an extraordinary ojou-sama. I knew she wasn&#8217;t a commoner, but it turned out that she was probably one of the most influential ladies in the country, if not the greatest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What I&#8217;m proposing to you this time is a job similar to mine]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You mean… I will be working as a maid?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You&#8217;re not a maid, you&#8217;re a butler]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, yeah, that sounds about right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got confused because I got involved in something that was too large for an ordinary person to handle..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Technically, you will not even be a butler, but it will be something similar. I would like you to be ojou-sama&#8217;s caretaker from now on. Will you agree to this?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No consent, no nothing&#8230; Are you sure you&#8217;re okay with me? Because, I&#8217;m just a student&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Normally, you would not be able to get this job without proper training, but&#8230; this is a special exception because it’s ojou-sama&#8217;s wish. She seems to like you a lot]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid then looked at the girl sleeping next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl in question was drooling all over herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mmm&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey! Oi&#8230; don&#8217;t be so clingy&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl turned over and hugged me tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the girl&#8217;s long, soft hair, I could smell a strange sweet and faint fragrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, if you have any indecent thoughts towards ojou-sama, I will cut you off]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What do you mean?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What you just thought of]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wasn’t good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was going to become a maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As for the details, I&#8217;ll let you discuss them with my master]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid said while looking at the scenery outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a break in the conversation, the car came to a stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama, we&#8217;ve finally arrived]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mmm…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl who was clinging to the right half of my body woke up languidly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car door opened automatically and we got out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of me sat the biggest house I’d ever seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here is&#8230;?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is a separate residence of the Konohana family. You will now meet with ojou-sama&#8217;s father.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More important than meeting the lady&#8217;s father, I was astonished by the fact that the mansion in front of me was a villa and not the main house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was a villa&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to this, wasn’t my house just a mere doghouse or a latrine?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Welcome home, ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I approached the front door of the mansion, the maids and butlers on either side of me bowed their heads in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of a group of at least ten servants, the lady in question lightly sighed, and then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She just replied with a small grunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ojou-sama was still going at her own pace. However, the followers all already knew this, and continued to bow their heads without showing any particular reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solemn door opened and I stepped into the house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior of the building, which looked as good as a luxury hotel, filled my entire field of vision. The red carpet stretched straight out and there were many luxurious furnishings scattered about. Unlike a hotel, this was a mansion where people lived, so the atmosphere was more relaxed than glittering, but even so, there were many golden ornaments that did not exist in the homes of ordinary people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wow&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What&#8217;s with the reaction?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it&#8217;s just that&#8230; this world is too different, and I&#8217;ve gotten goosebumps&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Get used to it. When you start working for ojou-sama, you&#8217;ll see this view every day, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hadn’t decided if I was going to work here yet, but I already had very little confidence in myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama, what are your plans for the rest of the day&#8230;?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As you wish. Now, I have to show Tomonari-sama around, so I&#8217;ll send someone to take his place]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid called out to the other attendants who were waiting by the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the girl frowned at the maid&#8217;s words, and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I knew it, I can&#8217;t sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Do you ever not sleep?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm&#8230; I’ll be with Itsuki for now]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl said as she picked at my sleeves. I was thinking, &#8220;I feel like I have a younger sister,&#8221; when I saw the maid next to me with her eyes wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I didn&#8217;t think&#8230; that ojou-sama would postpone sleeping&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered why she was so surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought this was normal, as she had slept through the whole kidnapping incident as well as the car ride.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid, who had come to her senses, began to walk again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After climbing the large staircase, the maid knocked on the door of the room at the end of the hallway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me, sir]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid opened the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a large room behind the door, and a man was standing in the center of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You&#8217;re Tomonari Itsuki, right? I&#8217;m Konohana Keigon. I&#8217;m Hinako&#8217;s father and the chairman of the Konohana Group.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man — Keigon — greeted me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a youthful face, but he wore a fine suit and was full of dignity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even though I&#8217;m the chairman, I&#8217;m only in charge of the business operations of the group. It&#8217;s not a very important position]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t jest. The next head of the family should not degrade himself so easily]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha, don&#8217;t get so upset, Shizune. It was just a light joke. If you create a reverent atmosphere, Itsuki-kun will shrink in fear]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon smiled and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, his eyes suddenly became very sharp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see. You&#8217;re right, Hinako is very fond of you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama looked at the girl behind me, Hinako-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, Hinako-san was lying face down with her hand on my sleeve, bobbing her head up and down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Standing and sleeping&#8230;!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was like a businessman commuting to work on the train. And she also started drooling again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to wipe off Hinako&#8217;s drool with a handkerchief I took out of my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nii&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was wiping her mouth, Hinako leaned slightly as if to lean her body against mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ve heard that &#8230;Itsuki-kun was only involved in the kidnapping of my daughter, but what happened in the meantime? I&#8217;ve never seen my daughter get attached to someone she&#8217;s never met that much before&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, no, I didn’t do anything]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. Well, Hinako lives by her instincts, so I’m sure you and her are on the same wavelength]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wavelength&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t feel like this is a problem that can be settled with a few words about wavelength.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, myself, don’t know how she became so attached to me.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And Hinako always wanted a caretaker that she could be comfortable with. However, my position makes it difficult for me to provide such a person. That’s why she doesn’t want to let you go, who she met by chance]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, that made sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She did say that she wanted an easy-going caretaker. She said that because all of her caretakers were too formal and polite to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, Before explaining about the whole caretaker thing, you need to know about Hinako first&#8230; Shizune]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid who was waiting in the back of the room curtseyed and started using the projector on the side of the room.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lights in the room dimmed and a video was displayed on a wall.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is what Hinako looks like when she’s at the academy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the center of the video, I saw the girl who was sleeping behind me — Hinako-san.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location would be the hallway of her school.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good day, Konohana-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good day]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako responded to her classmates&#8217; greeting with a sincere smile.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eh&#8230;? I wonder what the difference was.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene changed, and this time it was a video of a class being held.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, here’s the question… Konohana-san. Can you answer it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stood up quitely as she was called.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining a straight posture, Hinako walked to the blackboard and without stopping, wrote her answer with chalk.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had an air of elegance. The students around her looked at her with admiration.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene changed again. It was the same classroom but the color of sunlight told me that it was after school.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A female student was talking to Hinako, who was sitting on the window seat.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Konohana-san! We’re going to have a party in the garden&#8230; If you would like to join us, please let me know]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you are okay with me, I’d be glad]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you very much! I have prepared some delicious scones for you, Konohana-san!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fufu, you don’t have to be so cautious]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girls’ cheeks flushed with admiration as Hinako smiled at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video ended and the lights in the room brightened.  　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly revealed my thoughts.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Who?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: honestly, I died here)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s Hinako-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s ridiculous] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl in the video was innocent, pretty, and a very noble ojou-sama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was nothing like the girl who had been sleeping behind me since a while ago, bobbing her head back and forth&#8230; There’s no way&#8230; 　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako can act as a perfect ojou-sama in public]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;In public?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. On the contrary, if it’s private&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama looked at the maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid nodded silently and changed the image.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene was still a classroom. However, there were only two people in the video. Hinako and a female student wearing the same uniform.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-Ojou-sama, the next class is about to begin&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m tired. Sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said lazily, and plopped down on her desk.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene changed, and now it was in a hallway..　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-Ojou-sama! You have gym class next, so hurry up and get changed!&#8230;] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Dress me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scene changed to the schoolyard this time.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama!? Just now, a message from the main house came. It&#8217;s about Ojou-sama&#8217;s credit card being fraudulently used!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think I dropped it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why didn’t you tell me that earlier&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video cut off just before the female student screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last clip was unrefined&#8230; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the real Hinako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama said with a difficult face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, this girl, Konohana Hinako, had a big difference in attitude while in public and while in private.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was in private, Hinako had been in a lazy state from when I met her, so this was more familiar for me. Even though it’s only been close to 3 hours since we met.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umm, is the other girl in the video a maid or something?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That is Hinako’s former caretaker. She was hospitalized the other day with a punctured stomach due to stress, and submitted her resignation]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Wow]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a terrible thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In short, Hinako can play the role of a perfect ojou-sama in front of others, but outside of that, she becomes a self-depraved degenerate like she is now. There’s a huge difference between them. She needs an aid who can support both of her lives]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So that’s a caretaker’s job&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s what I mean]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon nodded in affirmation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The job of a caretaker is to protect Hinako’s status as a perfect Ojou-sama. In other words, to support Hinako so her degenerate side doesn’t come to light&#8230; What do you think, will you accept? It was Hinako’s request as well, and it will be a huge help if you can take care of her]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about it, and then I answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know I got rescued when the kidnapping happened and it might be shameful for me to ask but&#8230; Is there going to be any payment?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. Housing, three meals a day. and we’ll pay you plenty]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was&#8230; That was a whole lot of treatment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this what it means to have an unexpected stroke of luck? To me, who seemed to have run out of places to live, I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better deal&#8230; I wonder if they had taken my circumstances into account when they made this suggestion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As for the salary, how about… 20,000 Yen a day?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[20,000!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, was that not enough? However, it’s a bit unreasonable to make your salary the same as a butler or a maid&#8230; So, how about 50,000 Yen per day?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The opposite! It’s too much!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t expect the amount to go up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then I’ll hire at your price. How much do you want?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asking for a price. This is the first time I’ve ever heard it outside of a fictional story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If it’s a daily salary, 8,000 Yen is enough]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re working part time, it’s more than enough to get 8.000 Yen per day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I said something around the general market&#8230; but for some reason, Keigon-sama wrinkled his brows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-kun. The responsibilities of a caretaker is bigger than you think]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said, with a mysterious air around him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Between you and me, the Konohana Group’s performance has been dropping lately. The economy is a big factor, but there are also factional conflicts within the group as well as competitors, so things don’t always go as planned. It would be too much to overthrow a company, but they also can’t be completely ignored. That’s why the family my daughter will marry is important.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The family your daughter will marry into, you say?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama nodded and looked at Hinako, who was sleeping behind me.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The reason why Hinako plays the perfect role of ojou-sama in public is to find a better partner. In the time where someone isn’t sure what to do, they can always ask for help. The caretaker&#8230; is to assist in that. In other words, the caretaker is a crucial role to protect the Konohana family brand] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard that explanation, I began to think again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lived in a different world. I’d never thought about marriages or brands until now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, how much do you want me to pay you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pierced by Keigon-sama’s sharp gaze and swallowed my spit with a gulp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could understand the purpose of this question and I needed to answer carefully.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My resolution was being tested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama was asking me how much I was willing to work for.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I ask for the same cheap wage, I’d be looked down with disappointment, just like before. On the other hand, if I asked for a ridiculous price, I’d be laughed at for being unworthy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the answer I chose was&#8230; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;20,000 Yen, please]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm&#8230; the original price. Well, that’s fine. Then I’m expecting that much effort]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Keigon-sama took out a document from his desk drawer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While filling out something on the form, Keigon-sama continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, you’ll start working tomorrow]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Starting tomorrow?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’ve seen it in the video. Hinako would get lost even in the house without a caretaker. We need someone to support her as soon as possible]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wouldn’t be surprised if someone got lost in a mansion this big but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll get you some clothes first. I’m sending a tailor to your room for measurements]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ha…? You will also prepare my work clothes?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s more like a uniform instead. You’ll be going to the Kiou Academy from now on]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Haa!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was expecting something like a butler’s outfit, but I got an answer I didn’t expect at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako goes to the academy. Of course the caretaker would go with her]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, but, isn’t the Kiou Academy an incredibly prestigious school? I’m not sure if I’ll be able to fit in&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’ll have to adapt somehow. It’s part of the job. You have good scores in your previous school, so it’s not like you’re bad at studying right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had been working hard on my studies to increase my chances to go to college, but that was different from attending a prestigious school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will I be okay&#8230;? Studying, exercise, manners, communication skills… My worries were piling up endlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since caretakers aren’t allowed in the academy, you will be attending the academy as a general student. In your case, your status will be that of a member of the Konohana Group. In order to get you out of trouble, you are the son of an heir from an affiliate company, while not a direct descendant. You aim to become a manager in the future but you are someone who is familiar with the lives of ordinary people]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not normal to be the son of an heir&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a normal thing at the Kiou Academy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama said simply. It seems that the academy itself isn’t normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Your father’s company is part of the Konohana Group. That’s why you couldn’t raise your head against Hinako. I’m sure they’ll let you off the hook if you go with that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. It’s true that I’d have less chance of being exposed that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at the girl sleeping behind me. She was drooling again, so I lifted her chin and closed her mouth. She and I might be friends for a long time to come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, if you ever lay a hand on my daughter-]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realizing that Keigon-sama was glaring at me, I straightened my posture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, a little chop, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A little chop? Hahaha! No, I wouldn’t do that!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-sama laughed gaily. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll kill you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a simple yet scary statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, I’ll see you tomorrow]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Keigon-sama said this, the maid who was waiting in the back slowly opened the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just before I was about to walk out with the sleepy Hinako, Keigon-sama continued to talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, and I’ve been doing some research about your family]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, Keigon-sama said to me with a serious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The daughter of the Miyakojima family is also there. I’m sure you have nothing personal going on but, just in case, refrain from unnecessary contact]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see&#8230; so she’s also at the academy?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, she won’t remember me. We would never come into contact anyways. (TN: Say jinx right now)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry, I didn’t get a chance to introduce myself. My name is Tsurumi Shizune, and I’m the maid of ojou-sama. I’m going to give advice to Itsuki-san, who will become her caretaker, so please give me your attention]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The maid said as she walked down the hallway of the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san’s status will be an heir to a medium-sized company for outer appearances, but as long as you’re inside this mansion, you are the caretaker for ojou-sama. Because of that, please change how you address ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand. Hinako-sama, is that right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[On the other hand, outside of the mansion, you will be ojou-sama’s schoolmate, so it would be better to call her by name at that time]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While attending the academy, I would call Hinako-sama with “san”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to have a good sense of distance. I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, this is Itsuki-san’s room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said as she opened the door to the room. The room was about seven tatami mats in size and was simply furnished with only a bed and a study desk. It was probably a servant’s room. I was originally overwhelmed with the size of the mansion, but I felt relieved upon entering the room. I could easily adapt to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If there is any furniture you need, we can order it for you later. You can stay in this room  from now on]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told to get things I need but, a newcomer can’t be saying things out of the blue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d at least think about it when I was able to work like other people</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nuu~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment. The girl next to me made a strange voice and dived on the bed in the room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um&#8230; Hinako-saama. That’s my bed]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The caretaker’s bed&#8230; My bed&#8230; Zzzzz&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a squishy and happy expression on her face, Hinako-sama buried her face in the futon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Can’t be helped. Let’s allow the young lady sleep for a while]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san. You will be attending the Kiou Academy tomorrow as a transfer student&#8230; There are a few things you need to learn before that]</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it about the caretaker’s job?]</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s one thing, but there’s something else]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Kiou Academy is a prestigious school where the children of the rich and powerful gather. All of the classes are at a high level, so it’s not something someone with a normal life can suddenly keep up with. So, from now on until dinner, I will ask you to study the contents of the class]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is it really that high of a level?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. In addition, since you will be working with ojou-sama, your performance must be match hers]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m not confident]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not just academics. We also teach manners, etiquette, and self-defense]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Self-defence?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just in case]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was shocked, but Shizune-san continued calmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, have you lost your courage?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No&#8230; I’ve done a lot of labor. I’m confident in my physical strength]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. Then let’s see what you can do after you finish your prep work]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I smiled wryly at Shizune-san,  who told me in a matter-of-fact attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering Shizune-san&#8217;s attitude, it would be wise to take the initiative. Of course, she must be my boss as a caretaker&#8230; Maybe if I wasn’t good enough, she would give me spartan education forever!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m going to exact my vengeance on those who live a life of luxury and elegance in their mansions. (!!!!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t look down on the struggling students&#8212;. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m at my limit. Please forgive me. I’ll die]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That night, I was on my knees facing Shizune-san at the dojo in the corner of the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Right. Then let’s finish today’s lesson]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After completing a series of lessons on studying and manners, I was exhausted to the point where I was fading in and out of consciousness. 　  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self defense lessons were especially wearing me out, both physically and mentally. I never thought I’d be treated like a baby… Shizune-san is an outrageous martial arts maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please refer to this manual for more information about the caretaker’s job]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s thick]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I gave you a verbal rundown before dinner, but if you have any questions, look at the manual or ask me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said to me as I received the thick manual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um&#8230; My room, Hinako-sama is still sleeping there] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When she’s in the house, she’s usually asleep. Please do not bother her]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, but I’d like to go to bed soon&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You can sleep in the hallway. I’ll lay out a futon for you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was joking. Please wait until ojou-sama comes back to her room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’ll leave it to you. If you need anything else, just call me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Shizune-san left the dojo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking on the role of a caretaker, I received a smartphone provided to the servants of the Konohana family. I had Shizune-san’s number in my address book, but I didn’t want to call her… if possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve always known&#8230; Being a caretaker is a something that would normally require a very high-spec person]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered to myself as I left the dojo and headed for my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that Shizune-san’s lessons were going to be held every day. If I continue to do that, I’ll become a near-perfect human being, both literate and skilled, within a few months. It was that or&#8230; I’d give up before then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned to my room, I found Hinako-sama still on my bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm&#8230; Eheh&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Hinako-sama loved to sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She slept well whilst being kidnapped, but it seemed as if she would normally sleep soundly till morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a sigh and sat down in the chair at the desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to go to bed early, because I’m exhausted today. But with Hinako-sama in my bed, I didn&#8217;t know what to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh yea. The manual is for situations like this]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned the pages of the manual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, here it is. Things to watch out for when ojou-sama is sleeping, mansion edition&#8230; When she is in the house, the lady spends most of her time sleeping. If you wake her up when she’s sound asleep, she’ll be in a bad mood, so be sure to take her to her room&#8230; before… she’s&#8230; asleep&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, I had a grasp of where Hinako-sama’s room was, but I wondered if it’s okay to carry her without permission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to look it up in the manual as well&#8230; when suddenly my phone shuddered, leaving me confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Message received.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Do you want to come to school with me tomorrow?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I saw the message, I couldn’t help but let out a squeak.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Oh god, I forgot to explain]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My previous phone was in my parents’ name, so I had to sync my data to the phone provided for me. Therefore, messages from the previous phone were also received on this phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How should I explain my situation? As I was thinking over this, messages started raining down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: If you don’t want to, it’s fine! I’m going with my other friends!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Hey?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: &#8230;Don’t ignore me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t ignoring you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I couldn’t come up with a solution, I decided to be honest with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itsuki: Due to certain circumstances, I can no longer attend that high school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Ha?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got a reply immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Can I call you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itsuki: Sorry, I’m tired. Maybe another time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I couldn’t even think anymore. If I thought about something else now, I felt like I would lose all the information Shizune-san packed into my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phone shuddered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said another time but&#8230; it was a waste of time. I don’t feel like going out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving my phone for a while, I received another message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Why didn’t you answer?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Hey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri: Hello??</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hey]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whoa?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, someone called out to me from behind, and I jumped out of the chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, Hinako-sama was standing there with her eyes squinted sleepily. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, you’re awake…] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who is that person?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What?&#8230;Oh, um, it’s my childhood friend who went to the same high school as me, Hinako-sama&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hmmm]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako-sama, with her Implicative backchannel, reached for my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if she wanted to do some research on the internet. So I handed over my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’ll be taking this for a while]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako-sama crawled under the futon with my phone in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now I can be at peace&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Peace..? Hinako-sama, could I have that back please?] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako-sama said with her back turned away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I hate that tone]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does she mean&#8230; Oh, was it the honorifics?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Go back]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, but&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you don’t, you’re fired]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such arrogance&#8230; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is this what you want]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm&#8230; That’s it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san told me to change my tone…] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll talk to Shizune tomorrow]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If so, would it be ok&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I could ask Shizune-san tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What is it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Starting tomorrow&#8230; I’m pleased to make your acquaintance] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said with a softly amused smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, I got mesmerized by her gesture. And I responded a little later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satisfied with my reply, Hinako dove back into bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, hey! Wait! If you’re going to sleep, at least go back to your room!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she had already fallen asleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is with this girl&#8230;</span></p>
