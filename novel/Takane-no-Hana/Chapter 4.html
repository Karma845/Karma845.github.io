<h3>Chapter 4 - Caretaker.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s illness lasted longer than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Shizune-san’s assumption, Hinako was supposed to recover on Saturday, but her fever didn’t go down until Sunday morning. For the time being, she has been resting the whole day, and if it stays down until the next morning, she will go back to the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday morning. Hinako, who had recovered, got into the car looking lazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you sleepy?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn… I fell asleep halfway through the night]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I watched Hinako sleeping next to me, I remembered what I decided back on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a caretaker, I wanted to reduce Hinako’s burden as much as possible. There was no change in that regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Lend me your lap]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako put her head on my lap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lightly patted Hinako’s sleepy head. Startled, Hinako widely opened her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… something changed?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What made you think that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Somehow, feels kinder]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad to hear that.” I continued stroking Hinako’s head, neither confirming nor denying her question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Warm…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking more comfortable than usual, Hinako went to the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was a glance coming from the passenger seat. Shizune-san was watching us silently. </span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reached the classroom and I took my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students of the academy were full of energy on Monday morning. They must have a regular lifestyle as they’re very different from my classmates at my old school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yo, Tomonari!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Taisho-kun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I put my bag next to my desk, Taisho called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the tea party, I felt closer to Taisho. Although I needed Shizune-san’s permission, I was reminded once again that it was important to deepen my interactions with classmates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san as well, good morning! You took Friday off, what did you do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Asahi-san. I was helping out with some house work on Friday]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. That’s tough]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I listened to Asahi-san and Hinako’s conversation as they talked about Taisho and other trivial matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Hinako’s absence isn’t considered to be due to an illness at all. That may be right for appearance sake, but it’s still a complicated feeling for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　―Lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sneaked out of the classroom as usual and was eating my lunch with Hinako. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, open your mouth a little more]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fed Hinako, who opened her mouth a little bigger, a side dish from her bento. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, I was feeding Hinako her lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…I feel like this is the only thing out of place from my normal pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had only been fed like this when I was little. Either way, if this is a way for Hinako to relax, I’ll do my best to do it for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at her bento and let out a small grunt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… this is for you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako pointed a chopstick towards my mouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What she gave me was a piece of fresh and juicy green pepper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No can do. Even if you dislike it, you have to eat it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuuu…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could have just followed Hinako’s orders, I’m sure any other caretaker could’ve done the same. But it’s never that easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Hinako needs is the warmth of a family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must treat them like a member of your own family, and not yield in cases like these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do that, I need to care more about Hinako more than Hinako herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If your nutrition isn’t balanced, you’ll become ill]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.It’s not a big deal, I’ll just sleep in the mansion if I get sick. It’s probably easier that way…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t say that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t want her to feel that way, so I gave her some motivation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’d be happy if Hinako is healthy and well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Hinako lowered her gaze and put her chopsticks back in the bento.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’ll eat]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrified, Hinako ate a green pepper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but be impressed at the sight of Hinako eating green pepper while having a difficult look on her face.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school. I returned to the mansion with Hinako and was receiving Shizune-san’s training as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for the meal]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing dinner at the table in my room, I wiped my mouth and sat down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we were practicing table manners. I was eating all the dishes served to me with the knowledge I’ve acquired, while Shizune-san was standing by my side, calmly scoring me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re still moving awkwardly, but… you’ve acquired the bare minimum of knowledge]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However, you’re still too naive. I told you to leave from the left side of the table when you get up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… I’m sorry. I forgot]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered when I was sitting down. But, after finishing my meal, I relaxed and forgot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still have a lot to learn. I have to work harder to be there for Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;By the way, what does Hinako usually do for dinner?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly asked Shizune-san what I was interested in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I always eat in my room, being taught manners, but where… no, who does Hinako eat with?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama already finished her dinner in the dining room of the mansion]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san answered briefly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;All alone?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. The servants may help bring the food, but only Ojou-sama is allowed to eat]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a premonition that that was the case, but I still had mixed feelings about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… so, can I have dinner with Hinako from now on?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That would be a no]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a definite manner, I was given a firm rejection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san hasn’t finished learning mannerism. We will reconsider once Itsuki-san has mastered it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I can be there for Hinako by learning manners, I must work even harder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And, Itsuki-san. Please wake up Ojou-sama tomorrow morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wake her up… Me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As I told you on the first day, we will be increasing Itsuki-san’s work step by step. The caretaker will eventually be in charge of every aspects on Ojou-sama’s life, from getting her up to putting her back to bed]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Shizune-san’s explanation, I nodded.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning came early in the Konohana house. I woke up at 6 a.m., changed into my school uniform, and left my room immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, sweep and clean outside the room. After carefully wiping away the filth in front of the door, under the corridor, and near the stairs, the cleaning tools are placed in the center of the first floor. Although guests rarely visit the servants place, if it’s dirty, dust and dirt may latch on to the servants uniforms. We’re told to be thorough in our cleaning, as it was impolite to stand before a guest in dirty clothes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m on cleaning duty today. On other days, I can sleep a little more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7 am. The servants gather in the dining room to eat and begin the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were approximately 30 servants gathered in the dining room. Servants who had the night shift or day off didn’t attend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There will be no changes to the schedule today. Let’s just stick to it and get the job done]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servants replied [Yes] to Shizune-san’s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I learned when I started working here, Shizune-san is the head maid, which is the most prestigious position among the maids in the Konohana family. The servants of the Konohana family are led by 2 people, the head maid and head butler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7.30 a.m. The servants finished eating and moved their posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also headed to Hinako’s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san, good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way to Hinako’s room, I was called out by one of the maids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know it’s hard being a caretaker, but I wish you all the best]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman who encouraged me left swiftly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Little by little, I’m being accepted]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been a caretaker for a week now. My face is now well known to the servants of this house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I reached the front of Hinako’s room, I stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.I just need to wake her up, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I think about it carefully, I’ve never woken up a woman before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Shizune-san isn’t someone who gives out unreasonable instructions. I’ll think that she entrusted me with this because I could do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knocked and entered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s said that servants can enter without knocking. However, the Konohana family has a rule that new servants must knock first. With the recent developments of PC and other electronics, privacy has become more important, and they needed to change the rules to be more flexible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I entered the room, Hinako was sleeping comfortably on a bed with a fancy cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, it’s morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nuuu…. 3 more hours]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers are too different. I thought it’d be 3 minutes, but I can’t wait for 3 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wake up or you’ll be late]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I want to be late]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No good!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do that, all of your acting will be in vain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Hinako’s public image is ruined because of me, I’ll be dismissed as her caretaker. Then I wouldn’t be there for Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come on, get up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the blinds and curtains opened up, the room was bathed in dazzling sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuuuu…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rubbing her eyes with the back of her hands, Hinako raised her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh, I-Itsuki…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. Good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I greeted her, Hinako looked at me absentmindedly…. And went back to bed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are you going back to sleep…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Wake me up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, pointing her hands upwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want me to wake you up? …I smiled wryly at the spoiled Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pulled Hinako’s hands and lifted her up.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pWzXHSS/Screenshot-20220715-131846.png" alt="Screenshot-20220715-131846" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I lightly held her upper body, Hinako smiled slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After exchanging morning greetings once more, I picked up her uniform from the hangers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll leave your clothes here. I’ll wait outside]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Help me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Help me.. Get dressed]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, holding out her hands, that says “take off my clothes”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, helping out is a bit…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huuーrryー]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My job is to wake up Hinako and get her to the dining room. …I wonder if that also includes helping her get dressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, I undid Hinako’s button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could see Hinako’s skin through a gap in her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very stimulating sight, and it made me feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako closed her eyes leisurely and surrendered herself to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Calm down… calm down, me] (TN: no, not the little buddy)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I helped Hinako get dressed while thinking to myself. I opened all the buttons of her shirt to reveal her peach-coloured underwear. Squinting my eyes to the very limit, I helped her into her uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">。</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Hinako doesn’t look at me that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure Hinako is looking for someone who can give her the warmth of a family she trusts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to achieve that, I must get rid of my excessive thoughts. That’s what I thought―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san, are you there?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-yes!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard Shizune-san’s voice from outside the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so surprised and startled that I made a weird noise. (TN: in the raws, it was a slurred “Hai”, probably with a high pitch)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I forgot to mention that Ojou-sama often says things in her sleep. For example, sometimes she asked for help getting dressed… But you’re a man, so you wouldn’t take it seriously, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took it seriously!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do I do!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I apologize? It&#8217;d be better if I had her come here to help… no, it’s too late for that. If Shizune-san sees me like this, my life as a man will be over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-o-of course! Not having that much common sense isn’t my quirk!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. My apologies, you aren’t a thriving monkey. …I’ve come to understand over the past few days that Itsuki-san has a direct and dedicated personality. Like Ojou-sama, I too will place my trust on Itsuki-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hurts,It hurts,It hurts… It really hurts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, why do you give me compliments only at times like this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whaat~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Can you not tell Shizune-san that I helped you change clothes today?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked her to do so with cold sweat dripping down my face, Hinako thought for a bit before replying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If you make it part of your daily routine, sure]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll see you every morning, from now on…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GIVE ME A BREAK. Is what I said in my mind.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Midterms?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was currently in the classroom of the Academy, which I’ve grown accustomed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Taisho as I sat down in my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah. Tomonari just transferred in, so I thought I mentioned it. Midterms start next week]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Next week… It’s very early for midterms]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We also have earlier opening ceremonies compared to other schools]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was convinced by Taisho’s words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t heard anything from Shizune-san… but in any case, I never skipped preparing and reviewing every day. Even though I know it’s right before an exam, I’ll do the same as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, here’s some questions from past years. If you want to, you can try and do it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho then showed me a stack of papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I read through the contents and… I began dripping with cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…I could be in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s something I hardly know how to solve. Even though I’m receiving guidance from Shizune-san, I wonder if I’ll be able to solve this before next week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that I’ve never cut corners before, but I felt a sense of urgency.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunch break. As usual, I was eating lunch with Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… I want that next]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, looking at her lunch box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I kept my mouth shut, deep in thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;N, Ah, sorry. Hamburger steak?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I picked up the hamburger steak of Japanese beef with chopsticks and brought it to Hinako’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ishuki… whash wong?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Swallow it before speaking]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t understand what you’re saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako swallowed her food and then spoke again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… What’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like Hinako sensed that I was acting strangely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered with a sigh.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not a big deal, just the midterms seem to be harder than I thought. I was feeling a little down]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, it was a big deal. At any rate, a bad score could jeopardize my position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Studies, Economics, and English are subjects that can be managed by memorization. These can be managed over time…. But I can’t do anything other than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can teach you, if you want…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I may look like this, but I’m still at the top of the class…Doya?] (TN: I can’t just leave Doya out now can I, or a certain Doya god will kill me) (EDN: Basically a smug face if you didn’t know)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako puffed out her chest and said with full confidence and pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Come to think of it, you were always in the classroom teaching all kinds of people how to study]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn. My ability is well known. …Doya~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looks very proud of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It feels weird to me, who knows the real Hinako, that Hinako is the top student of the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m trying to be someone who Hinako can trust, but… I feel complicated that I have to get help from her, but I can’t go back now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can I ask you then?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Leave it to me~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I fed Hinako, who was now in a good mood, her dishes from her lunch box as a sign of gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After finishing lunch, I returned to the classroom and sat down at my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was relieved that I had a way to prepare for the exam, Taisho and Asahi-san approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, I heard about it. You’re anxious about the midterms?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi said. Apparently Taisho told her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes… For reference, I’d like to ask both of you, do you have anything special you do to study for the exams?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I don’t really have anything. If I had to say something, it’d just be spending more time studying than usual, or something like that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m the same as Asahi. Instead of prep work, I do review]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at Kiou Academy normally study after school so they can keep up without doing anything unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[On the other hand, how did you study in your previous school?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right… sometimes I pull an all nighter, and there was also study groups]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Study groups?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained to Asahi-san, who tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We all get together to study. When there’s more people studying together, it motivates me to do my best, and sometimes we cooperate by teaching others our areas of expertise]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of cooperation, however, mainly consisted of chatting to one another and not actually studying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, why don’t we try it out?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san happily replied to my explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A study group! Let’s do it, sounds fun and interesting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Taisho and Asahi-san’s eyes were shining brightly for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s have the same members as we had at the tea party. You know a lot of people with high grades]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s a good idea! I’ll try to invite them!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was just supposed to be a conversation, but before long, they’re completely on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But… what to do. I was going to ask Hinako to teach me instead….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, when are you free?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, about that… I haven’t decided to participate yet]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ehhh~ Aren’t you coming, Tomonari-kun!? You came up with it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah! Tomonari explained it, so participate as well!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mood was making it hard to refuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well… we can have a study group and let Hinako teach us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school. I talked to Shizune-san about the study group after the lessons were over. (TN: Usual lessons with Shizune)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A study group, is it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. To prepare for the exam, we decided to study together with the same members of the tea party…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It hasn’t been too long since the tea party… Is it really necessary to study in groups?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san gave me a sharp look. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since it’s only a preparation for the academy’s exam, I thought it’d be useful to learn from someone experienced]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that’s the case, I could always just ask Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do we study with the same members of the tea party? I have my own ideas.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is just my selfish idea but… All the people I invited to the tea party are the ones I rely on. Asahi-san, Taisho, Tennouji-san, and Naruka are very precious to me and I want to cherish it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So please, allow me to interact with them more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I implied this, Shizune-san gave me a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. I was also planning to start the actual curriculum of the exams tomorrow, but if that’s the case, we can adjust the schedule]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I widened my eyes at Shizune-san, who told me this indifferently. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. I didn’t know you already prepared it for me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You don’t need to worry about it. I’m an outsider after all. As Itsuki-san said moments ago, fellow students would be able to come up with more countermeasures]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’d be a waste if I didn’t use the time and effort that’s been spent already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the study group, let’s also complete the curriculum Shizune-san prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think that’ll be the end of today’s practice. Ojou-sama is waiting for you, so please go to your room as soon as possible]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thanked Shizune-san and left the dojo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The after school schedule for a caretaker is relatively hard. After completing class preparations and review, I’m also given table manners over dinner, more study after, and last is self-defense training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After practice, I then head to Hinako’s room and we go inside the bathroom together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The schedule was tough at first, but I finally got used to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;But, first]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembering my errands, I went to my room first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting the forgotten items, I head to Hinako’s room again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I joined Hinako, who was already in the bathroom and washed her hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Hinako was grunting and groaning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Are you still sulking?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But I was supposed to be the one to teach you… muuuu…] (EDN:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHERE IS HER POUT FACEEEEE)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry I decided to do this on my own. But it’s not like I’m going to stop studying with Hinako just because we’re having a study group]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Are you discontent with me?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that’s not what I meant but…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seems to be in a really bad mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I rinsed the shampoo off and got up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Just wait a bit]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went back to the dressing room and got the things I prepared earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t tell Shizune-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took something out of the cold bag, and handed it to Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s ice cream. I secretly bought it before getting into the car]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hinako and I supposedly live in different houses, she was supposed to get in the car alone first, then I went to a secluded place to get picked up. After school today, I secretly bought a cooling bag and ice cream before going to the meeting point and hid them in my bag. Shizune-san gave me the minimum amount of money when I go to school, so I used that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, have you ever eaten ice cream in the bathtub?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, but…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s the best thing you will ever taste]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also bought one for myself, so I’ll eat one first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hinako did the same and ate it while soaking in the bathtub.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[!! So good! So yummy…!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a sparkle in her eyes, Hinako is seriously impressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her happy expression, I can’t help but smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…I managed to get her back to a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was originally prepared for Hinako to take a break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a caretaker, my goal is to make Hinako’s days clear without collapsing. If she’s been collapsing regularly, that means the way she’s done it up until now isn’t working.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These small steps become important. The things I’ve prepared with this in mind paid off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A piece of ice cream falls to the floor. The floor was warm and the ice cream quickly melted. …Hinako quickly scooped the leftover liquid with the palm of her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[3 second rule]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I frowned at Hinako&#8217;s bragging. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, don&#8217;t do that on fluids…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;3 second rule]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule isn’t applicable here. Hinako looked dejected and put the liquid back on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just so you know, don’t do the 3 second rule in public too often, okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm… I’ll be careful]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t sure if she was paying attention or not, as her response was vague and ambiguous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… the study group, when are you doing it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We haven’t decided a date yet, but the sooner the better. Maybe tomorrow or the day after…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[..I’ll join]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the way the conversation went, I knew she’d say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike at the tea party, I have a sense of uneasiness now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I forgot to ask but… maybe the reason Hinako got sick before was because Hinako attended the tea party?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling guilty, I asked that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If so, I think the study session will be a burden for Hinako. I think it would be easier for Hinako if she went back to the mansion first]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to my words, Hinako answered thoughtfully. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not like… that’s any better]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said. She didn’t say much, but I can probably understand what she meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easier for her to be alone, but it doesn’t necessarily mean she’s happy with that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I also wanted Hinako to interact with as many different people as possible. Considering the examples of Naruka and Tennoji-san, I feel that Hinako should have good friends too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides… I hate it more if I don’t have Itsuki by my side]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed at Hinako when she told me this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, would you like to join us?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school. I said to myself as I recognized the faces of the students gathered at the round table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, let’s begin this study session]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Asahi-san who was the first to shout with joy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn’t exactly the tension of a regular study group, but I feel like pointing a finger at them is a bad idea, so I’ll keep my mouth shut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were at the cafe we used when we had our tea party. The members around the table were the same as last time: Me, Asahi-san, Taisho, Hinako, Naruka, and Tennouji-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… once again, these are some gorgeous faces. It’s reliable to have 2 top graders in the school to help]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such words from Taisho made me wonder.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think Konohana-san is in first place, but who’s the second…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m in second place]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san, sitting next to me on my right side, answered in a sulky voice. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san has a strong rivalry feeling against Hinako. I apologized to her in a whisper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Asahi-san also has good grades, doesn’t she?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well~. Out of all of us. I’m sure Miyakojima-san would’ve done better}</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Asahi-san said that, Naruka’s face twitched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I only have good grades on PE and history…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[History?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Miyakojima family is a family that respects the spirit of bushido. Because of that, I was forced to study history from a young age] (TN: Bushido is a moral code concerning samurai attitudes, behavior and lifestyle.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka told us, as if it were hard to say. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, in almost every other subject… I barely passed the red]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The table fell silent, and Naruka turned red in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Hinako, who can do both academics and sports, Naruka only specializes in sports.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, what can I say… sorry]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, it’s fine. Don’t worry about it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said sadly. Naruka is feared and respected due to various misunderstandings, but because of that, she has many shortcomings that are often overlooked. Asahi-san and Taisho were looking at Naruka with respectful eyes at the tea party, but now they’re looking at her with friendly eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is…. Well, looks like I’ll have to do my best]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san muttered with a difficult look on her face, and looked at me.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san. Do you have any idea how the study group will proceed?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No… we were just going to get together and study]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, how about splitting it up into 2 groups, the ones teaching and the ones being taught? That should be more efficient. …I, Konohana-san, and Asahi-san will be on the teaching side.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, there are 3 people being taught: Me, Taisho, and Naruka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Which subjects are you weak in, Tomonari-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Anything that isn’t just memorization. …I think math will be especially tough]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly confided in her about my weak subjects. Hinako, sitting next to me on my left, then responded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you like, I’ll―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―If that’s the case, I’ll help with your studies. I’m good at mathematics]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was about to say something, but Tennouji-san’s well-projected voice drowned it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blink of an eye, Hinako’s smile hardens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, should I teach Miyakojima-san? I don’t have any particular subjects I’m not good at, so I think I can help raise your average score] (TN: Just to be clear, this is Asahi-san)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[P-Please do!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka replied in a stiff voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-That means, I’m with Konohana-san…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes. I look forward to working with you, Taisho-kun]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yes, me too!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho seems tense, but he’s clearly pleased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, on the other hand, was smiling kindly―while stomping hard on my foot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hurts it hurts it hurts…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, Hinako wanted to teach me since yesterday. So because it’s Tennouji-san instead of her who will teach me, she must be in a bad mood. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not like Hinako and I can’t study together after we get back to the mansion… Ouch ouch, it hurts, stop drilling my foot with your heels. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, let’s get started then]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tennouji-san’s words, we all began to study.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 hours have passed since we began to study in our own groups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At my previous school, study sessions would be full of chatter after 30 minutes, but here, students concentrated on their studies in silence. I guess this is exactly what it means by growing up differently. I was really feeling a sense of urgency about the exam, and I was grateful I could make use of this opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you okay, Miyakojima-san? Should we take a break?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-yeah… please. Frankly, my head is about to burst…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka held her head and whimpered weakly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Taisho-kun. Let’s take a short break too]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, yesh~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho, who was still nervous, replied to Hinako’s suggestion in a hushed voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shall we take a small break as well?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san, who’s teaching me math, makes a suggestion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I answered without looking away from the notebook in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, just a little more, please]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Tennouji-san, I was able to slowly solve problems I didn’t understand before. I don’t like studying to the extent of considering it fun… but it’s moments like these when I can see my growth and feel rewarded. …That’s why, I want to continue just a little bit longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Tomonari-kun is a very serious person, isn’t he]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Asahi-san looked at me and said, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, no, I don’t mean to make fun of you. I’m being serious]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. I like the fact that you have the desire to improve yourself]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennoji-san agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure it was Tomonari-san who planned and started this study session as well, right? Tomonari isn’t fully aware of being a leader but… on the other hand, he’s very good at supporting and pushing others forward]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I have no intention of standing on top of others, I was going to let the point go by, but… I was a little surprised to hear the praise she gave in the second half.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s with that face?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I was just surprised, or rather happy, to receive such a compliment…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, I’m good at judging a person’s character, you know. In fact, I chose all my servants myself]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennoji-san says proudly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san’s servants tend to be quite a tough bunch, don’t they?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When I’m outside, I… At home, I have a different servant by my side]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Servants in the Konohana family are basically employed by Keigon-san, but in the Tennouji family, it seems that their daughter, Tennouji-san, has the right to choose her own entourage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, Tomonari-kun, who caught Tennouji-san’s eyes, has a promising future, doesn’t he?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, I think so. I think it’s a bit rude to look at a classmate as a servant, but… if he’s up for it, I think he’s promising enough to be considered being scouted]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Being a servant for the Tennouji family, the conditions aren’t too bad either. …Tomonari-kun, this is something to think about, okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san said happily. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, murderous intent was directed at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Hinako and Naruka were staring at me sharply. (EDN: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harem time?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;W-Well, I still have no intention on doing so for the time being]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, that’s a shame]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san, of course, was not too disappointed, as it was a redundant conversation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I think we should take a break too. There’s a limit to our concentration, and we’ll think better after a rest]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, I plan to continue studying after returning to the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to make adjustments so that I don’t use all my energy here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Tomonari. Where are you going?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m taking a break, and I wanted to stretch a little… so I’ll go for a walk for a while]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told Taisho and left the cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to do some stretching to change my mood, but I was reluctant to do it in a conspicuous place, so I moved to the back of the school building, where there were only a few people. The back of the building is also well cleaned. I began to stretch slowly as the wind blew outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m blessed, aren’t I]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recall the members of the study group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, Naruka, Taisho, Asahi-san, and Tennouji-san. …I had friends before in my previous school, but my current relationship isn’t bad. They’re all kind and reliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first I thought being a caretaker would be difficult and a burden, but before I knew it, I was feeling very comfortable in my current situation. I wanted to support Hinako, but I also wanted to protect this current environment around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Let’s do our best in studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I made up my mind to do so, I suddenly heard footsteps behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned around when I heard my name called. And I found Tennouji-san standing behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm? Are you taking a walk, Tennouji-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I too, would like to stretch a little]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see, I wanted to reply, but before I could do so, she said, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―That was just a front]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have, a few questions for you, Tomonari-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What do you want to ask…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no idea what she was about to ask, and then she opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san. Are you really the son of a middle-aged man with a solid business plan?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question struck my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My relaxed mood faded away and cold sweat started flowing from my entire body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Did she find out?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Why? Did the information leak?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pushed down my agitation, and tried to be as calm as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What makes you think so?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t see her intention in asking this question. Is Tennouji-san convinced that my identity is false? …If so, there’s nothing I can do about it now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Table manners]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said briefly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I guess that means my manners wasn’t good enough]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, there were some poor points, but it was done in an acceptable way. But to my eyes, it looked… fake]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said with an observant look at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I feel that there’s something different in your way of doing things. Your manners… it’s as if you crammed it into your mind, even if it’s just by a little. At the very least, it’s not the actions of someone who’s been educated from an early age as a heir candidate]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recall that Tennouji-san told me earlier that she has good eyes for people. That’s something not even Shizune-san pointed out to me. Naturally, I didn’t know of it either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t get me wrong, I’m not accusing you of anything]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was deep in thought, Tennouji-san adopted a calmer look and told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was just a little curious, you see. Tomonari-san is a transfer student, so he probably never had to learn manners before. It makes sense if I think of it that way, but… it’s too good to be true]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Too good to be true?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It means that only your knowledge is ahead. You’ve put in a lot of effort over the last few days, haven’t you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although her tone was questioning me, Tennouji-san was clearly confident in this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why does Tomonari-san make such an effort.? I just thought that the answer might lie in your status. …If you don’t want to talk about it, I won’t pry any further]</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nPYK2yy/index-244-1-732x1024.jpg" alt="index-244-1-732x1024" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(EDN: UWOOO OJOU)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not prying. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, but I still had my doubts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You don’t find it suspicious?] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san answers my fearful question with a gentle smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think it’s possible to register someone suspicious at this academy. Tomonari-san must have had his background checked by the academy when he transferred]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, Naruka also said that a while back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, why did Tennouji-san mention this topic?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I just, simply asked out of my own curiosity]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps reading my mind, Tennouji-san said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Could it be, you too…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a very quiet voice, Tennouji-san muttered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head, unable to hear anything she said, and Tennouji-san looked at me as if she gained back her composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s nothing. …we should get back soon]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s true]</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned to the cafe with Tennouji-san, Asahi-san and the others were chatting and laughing happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s a lot of excitement here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san called out to them as she sat in her seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Tennouji-san. I was talking about the tea party at Konohana-san’s house]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tea party? …Oh, you mean the annual Konohana social circle, which is around the beginning of spring every year?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As expected, Tennouji-san knows about it already]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, it’s famous, you know. I think the event is being held the week after midterms. I heard it was a big social event with a lot celebrities attending]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently there’s a social event coming up soon hosted by the Konohana family. I had no idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Have you ever participated, Tennouji-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My father attended a few times, but not me. The social gathering is for adults, and besides… the Tennouji and Konohana families have a delicate relationship]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san guessed what Tennouji-san meant. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not that we don’t get along. It’s just that feeling other’s intentions isn’t in my nature, so I’ve declined until now]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the air turned sour, Tennouji-san told us in a matter-of-fact manner. As a commoner, I don’t understand what “feeling other’s intentions” means, but everyone else seemed to be content with her answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Have you ever participated, Miyakojima-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-no, I mean, I’m sure the invitation came… but, I’m not good at socializing…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka answered Tennouji-san’s question as if it was hard to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I knew that invitations came to Tennoji-san’s and Miyakojima-san’s family. …It’s nice isn’t it. If it’s a ball big enough for the Konohana family to host, they’ll have things like dances, right? I like to wear dresses, so if there’s a social gathering, I’m always willing to participate]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san said enviously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hinako smiled softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Asahi-san. I can send you an invitation, if you’d like?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh, really!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. As Tennouji-san said, although it’s recognized as social gatherings for adults, we have no such intentions on our part, so please feel free to join us. There will be a dance party, and we have several attendees of our age]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-what should I do… I was nervous when I was told it’s ok to participate. But maybe this is a valuable opportunity… Can I have it? The invitation]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I will arrange it to arrive within 3 days]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yoosh… Then I’ll be dressed up and ready to go on the day of the event! I’ll be in your care, Konohana-san!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako easily promised to give an invitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Hinako, secretly whispering in her ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is it really okay? Deciding this on your own]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn. …I was told to invite them since this social event was to show the Konohana family’s dignity. …I’ve never done this before though]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve never invited anyone before?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the students of the academy are all children of wealthy families. The Konohana family won’t lose anything by inviting them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[K-Konohana-san! Does that mean I can also join?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I will also send Taisho-kun an invitation as well]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho shows his excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;This is also part of the plan]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san, I will be participating this time. …That’s how we ended up around the same table at the tea party and study group, and now I can accept the invitation not as the daughter of the Tennouji family, but as a friend]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, would you like to join us?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s see, I’ll…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san asked me, and I took a glance at Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako smiled softly. As a caretaker, we go to the academy together. But I don’t think I should be allowed to attend social gatherings… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s right. I’m sure this is a good opportunity, so I’d like to participate]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I implicitly convey the nuance that no promises can be made.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What about you, Miyakojima-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-wait, me!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they asked Naruka, she was surprised and her shoulders jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I will go… If I can]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everybody except Naruka, had a difficult face at her classic glib. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’ll leave it at that, since I’m sure she’ll be confused and bewildered if we force her to join us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study group continued― and a few days later, the midterms of the Kiou Academy began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

 <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The midterm exams at Kiou Academy were structured a little differently than my old school. The exam time for one subject was ninety minutes. It was simply longer because there were more questions. In addition, subjects not found in other schools, such as economics, were added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The midterm exams took place over three days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, on the last day, with the last exam done… I could finally let out some steam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Somehow, it’s done]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the chime of the exam rang out, I breathed a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students left the school looking exhausted because there were no classes today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a glance at Hinako’s direction. Hinako was surrounded by her classmates, chatting about how well she had done on the exam. It looked like it would take a while, so I headed to the restroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was returning to the classroom after using the restroom, I encountered a familiar face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naruka?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki huh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka, who was walking down the hallway with unsteady steps, turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes were devoid of light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha, it’s done. …the test and me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m guessing it was useless]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although I suspected this from the study sessions, it seems that Naruka is quite poor in studying. Except for the subjects of PE and history, she seems to be below average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How did Itsuki do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;At least I think I escaped red marks]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pffft, I’m sure you did. I thought that’d be the case. …Because you’re a traitor]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What do you mean, a traitor…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You work at Konohana-san’s house, away from me, and have better grades than mine…. After all, Itsuki is my benefactor. It reminds me of how I’m a bad person in a way. …Does Itsuki hate me by any chance?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I don’t hate you….]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;&#8230;..No fair]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not wanting to get caught up in the overflowing negative aura any further, I quickly turned around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-then, I’ll just go and… see you tomorrow]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomorrow… I wish I could take a break…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You sound like Hinako. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I parted with Naruka, who gazed out the window with distant eyes, and returned to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, Hinako also seemed to have finished chatting with her classmates and was getting ready to leave the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, after Hinako gets in the car, I get in at the rendezvous point further away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work on the exam]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I got inside the car, I was approached by Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How was it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thanks to your help, I was able to solve them reasonably well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not sure how much “reasonably well” means, but considering the results of the mock exam on the day before… It wasn’t too bad. It’s worth studying hard, isn&#8217;t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san’s praise made me feel like the test was finally over.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―I guess I managed to overcome it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―I passed one. But I can’t let my guard down. I’ll continue to study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car heads to the Konohana family mansion. There’s not much conversation today because I was tired too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, Ojou-sama. The day after tomorrow, on Saturday, I’ve been asked to tell you to attend a meal along with Keigon-sama] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said from the passenger seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The guests are the CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding corporation, as well as the director of several other members of Sea Japan United. Chikamoto shipbuilding&#8217;s plan is to partner with the companies under Konohana group. Sea Japan United partnered with Chikamoto shipbuilding for economic purposes, and that kind of relationship is appearing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While looking over the documents, Shizune-san continued to explain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When she was 7 years old, Ojou-sama greeted the CEO of Chikamoto Shipbuilding at a social gathering. When arranging the meal recently, the other party wanted to see the grown up Ojou-sama at a glance, and I’ve been informed that Ojou-sama has been decided to attend. Please do not misbehave]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnnー&#8230;so annoying]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps accustomed to this kind of exchange, Shizune-san continued without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was sitting to my right, pouting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And, Itsuki-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will ask Itsuki-san to come closer to the venue on the day of the event]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at the unexpected words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure you’ll have opportunities to attend social circles in the future, so there’s no harm in getting used to the atmosphere now. The meal will be held outdoors, so please observe from afar as a servant of the Konohana family on the day of the meal]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p  style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday. On the day that Hinako was to attend a meal with Keigon-san, I had changed into clothes that Shizune-san gave me to accompany her as a servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A suit, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mutter to myself as I ask Shizune-san to check my outfit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Do you not like it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that’s not what I meant… I’m just not used to wearing it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike my part-time and school uniform, the clothes are a bit tight and uncomfortable. However, my outfit in the mirror looks good compared to my usual school uniform. It may be because I had my hair set up, but I think it’s because of the high quality of the suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, that suit is the highest Italian brand, costing 700,000 yen]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please treat it with the utmost care]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was even more than I imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t leave a single stain on the suit. With that mission in mind, I left the mansion with Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the venue]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took about an hour to drive there but we finally arrived at our destination, a pension house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san. Is this another Konohana family residence?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s more like an event venue than a villa. This one is mainly used for events like this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large, well-maintained Western-style house sat before us. The front desk was decorated in the same luxurious style as a first-class hotel, and there was a spacious golf course next to the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, please go to the front desk, Ojou-sama. We will be waiting outside]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, dressed in neat and tidy attire for the meal, nodded her head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here on, we will be separated from Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m… going to go meet an uncle I don’t know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Stop making it sound like a crime]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a sudden sentence that was hard to respond to from my position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought that was the end of that but… Hinako was still here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is it now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m off to do my best]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at me with a somewhat expectant look in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should have said so, preferably from the start…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, I’m rooting for you. When this is over, we can relax at the mansion together]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako smiled as I said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn. Ice cream, I want more]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, Hinako went to Keigon-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she was about 5 meters away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ice cream?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san mumbled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san, what does she mean by ice cream?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my face away from the cold gaze that was thrown at me.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako left Itsuki and the others, going towards the front desk of the villa alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father, Keigon, was easily spotted. Like Itsuki, his attire was a black suit, but this one was of the highest brand and custom made.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servants of the Konohana family were required to wear expensive uniforms in order not to spoil the dignity of the family, but at the same time, there was a rule that they shouldn’t wear more expensive clothes than the head of the family in order to raise the head of the family. While Itsuki’s suit was a ready-made product costing about 700,000 yen, Keigon’s suit is much more expensive, costing more than 1 million yen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Long time no see, Hinako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn… it has]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako responded to her father’s words with the bare minimum expected of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How did you do on the exam?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No problems]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s good. Keep your grades up, as the daughter of the Konohana family]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon told her as if it were a business call, there was no happiness, anger, or sorrow in his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How about Itsuki-san? It’s been about a month since he’s become a caretaker…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;The best]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako replied with a bit of enthusiasm, and Keigon opened his eyes in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s rare. I never thought Hinako would praise a caretaker so much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’d like to keep working with Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so. It was an experimental attempt to hire a commoner who had nothing to do with the Konohana family, but… I’m glad to see that it worked out well]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon didn’t smile, just like a researcher who had confirmed the success of an experiment. He then moved only his eyes and looked at Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re not under any influence, are you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Influence?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure that Hinako’s personality goes well with him, but Itsuki is a commoner. There’s no need for you to be seduced by him and become a part of the mundane world]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: original translation was ordinary/regular person, but commoner sounds better since he’s judging the situation)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at him strangely, not quite understanding what he meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s get moving. Hinako, please don’t do anything rash]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a serious look on his face, Keigon put the nail in the coffin. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment after Hinako immediately put on her facade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, father]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Good girl]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a lady amongst ladies. As the most talented girl in the Kiou Academy, Hinako starts her act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later, a car pulled up in front of the villa and the guests for the meal arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for coming all this way]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha, I like to come here, so don’t say so. I’m told that today is a casual meeting]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guests were breaking the ice, while Keigon solemnly greeted the guests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 5 guests. 2 of them were directors of Chikamoto shipbuilding, and the others were directors of Sea Japan United. All of them appear to be older than Keigon. The Konohana family is supposed to be the most prestigious among these families, but the reason they have the leisure to relax is because of their age difference and experience. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, it’s been a long time. Do you remember me?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding called out to Hinako.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. When I was 7 years old, I greeted you at a social gathering]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m glad you remember me, even after a long time. You’re still polite as ever]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding was impressed. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hoo, is this Konohana-san’s daughter?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Her name is Hinako]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako bowed elegantly at Keigon’s introduction.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve heard rumors. I have an acquaintance who has a child attending Kiou Academy. I heard through a friend of mine that you’re called the perfect lady at the academy]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m flattered]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako bowed politely.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She’s also very promising, with excellent grades. …I’m sure Konohana-san must be very proud to have a daughter with such a good reputation] </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I’m grateful that my own daughter has grown up to be honest and upright]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon then took a quick glance around at the guests&#8217; faces. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure you must be tired of talking while standing, so let’s move to the venue. We have a table outside at Chikamoto-san’s request, if that’s alright]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. It’s a nice day today. And we don’t have a big meeting, so we can relax and talk in the breeze]  </span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was watching Hinako and the others having a meal with Shizune-san.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How is it, Itsuki-san? The atmosphere]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s see…] (TN: soudesune. I have no clue what to put in)</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered Shizune-san’s question without moving my gaze.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Somehow, their manners are very casual. Each movement is natural… but you can tell that they’re still paying attention…]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That is proper manners]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san explained.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It feels natural to the point where no one feels suffocated, but enough to make it clear that everyone is showing their manners and polite behaviors. It may seem tokenistic at first glance, but the sense of cooperation created by mutual adherence to common rules builds stronger relationships of trust]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Trust, is it…]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Although manners are often despised these days, there are many situations where it is necessary. It is necessary, especially for the upper echelon. …Manners are not about words, but about attitude. It becomes necessary because we’re in a position where we can’t say what we really feel]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s harsh. There are times where I can’t understand it as a commoner.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s why it’s very rude to break it]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, Shizune-san shut her lips.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also keep my mouth shut and observe Hinako, Keigon-san and the others at the meal.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meal seemed to be going well so far.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, you still study even after you get home?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. However, I don’t study all the time]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was talking to the executives after swallowing a mouthful of finely chopped vegetables with a knife.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They set their sights on Hinako, initially watching over her warmly like a beloved daughter, and their inner feelings gradually started to surface. A woman with such a beautiful face and figure, and extremely courteous Hinako, the title of a perfect Ojou-sama truly suits such an embodiment perfectly.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She is a very nice girl. I would like to exchange her for my son, who’s a complete idiot]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding tells Keigon with a laugh.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Surely you jest. The CEO’s son also graduated from an excellent university, didn’t he?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Education and capability are 2 different things. He’s still immature, and I don’t think I can let him take over for the time being]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO said regretfully.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A servant of the Konohana family collects the empty plates and distributes new dishes.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, no meat?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Today’s menu is a little lighter because it&#8217;s still lunch time. If it were dinner, I would’ve made something a little more grandiose…]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have other matters to attend to in the evening. I would’ve preferred dinner if I could]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hahaha, the CEO and executives laughed.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako-chan is still a student at her age. Maybe she wanted to eat something more?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I’m a small eater, I’ve had enough]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a fake smile, Hinako replied to them. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding puts his finger to his chin when he sees her beautiful and courteous behavior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh my, she’s as good as they say she is. I’m sure she’ll have a lot of options to marry into]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I would be delighted as a parent if that were to happen, but I’m sorry to say that no such plans have been made yet]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Keigon said that, the CEO was slightly surprised. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, is that so? If it was Konohana-san’s daughter, it wouldn’t be surprising to have a fiance…]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There used to be one, but for various reasons we ended the relationship. He’s not here anymore]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hooo]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO’s eyes narrowed.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually, I have an acquaintance who is looking for a marriage partner]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon almost smiled, but quickly suppressed it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Could I ask for further details?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. My acquaintance is from a family that does a lot of business with foreign countries. The size of their business is okay, but it’s a business that involves celebrity clients, so they were hoping for someone who is polite and respectful. Well, it’s just my idea, after all but… I thought your daughter might be someone he would like] </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see. The other party is the son of said acquaintance]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. I’m pretty sure he’s in his early twenties]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was given this information, Keigon started thinking about the Konohana family’s future.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An acquaintance of the CEO of a shipbuilding company. A family with extensive overseas business dealings. If so, the business is definitely related to trade. Although not so large in size, the fact that the business is aimed at the celebrity segment of the market suggests that it’s a unique market. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will consider it]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha, this is a long shot, isn’t it?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You jest. I will seriously consider it]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telling the CEO it wasn’t flattery, Keigon tilts his cup to his mouth.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, their plates were collected and the last item on the menu was placed on the table.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here is the dessert]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, baked sweets? An elegant dessert like this isn’t bad once in a while]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding said [what a coincidence]&#8230; But in fact, Keigon had investigated that the man likes baked goods. Sure enough, the CEO is in a good mood and enjoying the pastry. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san. About what you just said, may I inform my acquaintance about it?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. As a father, I can vouch for my daughter’s abilities]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the son of said acquaintance is worthy of Hinako isn’t relevant at this point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important thing is to make connections. Even if this doesn’t work out, another may come along, as it did this time.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, that’s why―]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Keigon turned around, calling Hinako’s name.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was just in the middle of picking up a piece of goods that fell on the table with her hands.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executives were stiff and shocked, with their mouths open. Hinako, oblivious to the air freezing rapidly, quickly puts a piece of the food into her mouth.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―3 second rule.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, right after he was about to speak.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako remembered that Itsuki wasn’t there, and that they were in the middle of a meal. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ah]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small voice escapes Hinako&#8217;s lips.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hmm]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding lightly stroked his beard.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Maybe a little less than the reputation had suggested]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I knew Hinako had done it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Ahhh.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe I let out my voice at the same time as Hinako.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako must’ve also realized her mistake. But it was too late now.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meal resumed without a hitch. At first glance, everything seemed to be fine, but… I noticed that Keigon-san’s expression turned grim for a moment.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s not good]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san muttered next to me.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s going to happen…?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(insert pict hinako on the table)</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know. But… considering Keigon-sama’s personality, this is as close as it gets to the worst-case scenario]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, who’s usually calm, speaks in a tense voice.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a bated breath, we waited for the end of the meal. About 10 minutes later, the participants came out of the villa, preparing to leave.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for coming today]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I had a lot of fun today. Sometimes it’s necessary to take a breather like this]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO and executives, who are guests of Keigon-san, greeted him in a good mood as they were in awe. (TN: I have no clue why he’s in awe)</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t look like a mess… But the CEO of Chikamoto shipbuilding opened his mouth as if he just remembered.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, and Konohana-san. I’m not sure what to do about that marriage proposal, but please pretend it never happened. For now, if I introduce them, it&#8217;ll affect my reputation]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha, I’m not too concerned about it. I don’t know how to put it, but it’s just a third party who isn’t here at the event. As for myself, I would like to continue to get along with Konohana-san both publicly and privately]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, I think so too]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guests got into their cars, and left the villa.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, after seeing all the guests off, Keigon-san turned to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who taught Hinako those unsightly gestures?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That is…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san stuttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to bear the atmosphere, I decided to confess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Excuse me. It was me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I honestly told him, he let out a sigh of relief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if he knows that was the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve always wondered. If having a caretaker was necessary]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As you know, Hinako has a big gap between her true self and her acting. The role of a caretaker is to hide the blunders and follow up on them to the best of their abilities. …However, this is a roundabout way of doing things]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a glance at Hinako, Keigon-san continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His eyes were so cold I could hardly believe they were the eyes of a parent looking at his daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We shouldn’t allow any blunders in the first place. …This is what happens when she has a true personality. The caretaker is the one who encourages Hinako and pampers her]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muttering to himself, Keigon-san looked at Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune. From now on, make sure Hinako is always acting, both publicly and privately] (TN: can we unlive this man?) (EDN: Toaster Bath it is)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[All times, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. Make her act at all times, not only in public, but also in the mansion]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m afraid that would make Ojou-sama collapse quicker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fix it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short and to the point, Keigon-san said sharply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the result of pampering her just because she collapses. It’s not like you have a chronic disease…. I can’t stand it anymore. We will provide the time and leadership if necessary. …Since she was born into the Konohana family, it’s her duty to uphold the family name]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard those words, the worst possible future passed through my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―It’s not a matter of collapsing or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acting at all times means…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s true self… is completely sealed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-wait a minute!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped him without thinking. He turned his head towards me, with his expressions cold. For a moment, I felt my nose freeze, but I uttered these words in a trembling words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That… I’m sorry for ruining the meal because of me. But whatever the price is, I’ll―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not your fault]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Originally, many caretakers quit after a short period of time. So I thought that you would too. …I expected your influence to be trivial and insignificant. It is not you who is to blame, but me for making such judgment, and Hinako for being so gullible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regret painted all over his face, Keigon-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune. When you return to the mansion, pay Itsuki-kun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at the end of our brief conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My… pay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, it’s almost payday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the reason for the sudden pay is…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From now, Hinako won’t need a caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san said as he glared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san. As of today, you will be dismissed from being a caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BREAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAk</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 hours later. I was stunned, staring at the big closed gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;This is a lie, right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the head of the Konohana group, Keigon-san’s dexterity is unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning to the mansion, I was immediately ordered by Keigon-san to pack my belongings. Because of the sudden and abrupt dismissal, I was given extra as my salary. [If you don’t have anywhere to go, you should make do with this amount of money for the time being], he said, with a freezing and penetrating expression, exerting his dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was given an unbelievable amount of money for my services, and I was evicted out of the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just a day…. Within a few hours, my daily life collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will no longer attend Kiou Academy. As for the withdrawal procedure, I’m sure that it’ll be swift and quick. The Konohana family is powerful. They can clean up after themselves as much as they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dry laugh came from my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well, and I was living the life I always dreamed of]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thought of giving up started taking over my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish it had all been a dream. If so―then Hinako wouldn’t have suffered so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this continues, Hinako will be forced to live an even more harsh and painful life than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with the way it is, I can’t even complain to Keigon-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―I’m the cause of all this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san said I’m not responsible, but that’s not true. All because I taught Hinako that stupid 3-second rule. Even more so, I knew that Hinako had an extraordinary interest in the culture of commoners, and left it at that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The responsibility is mine. When I think about it… I can’t do anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was walking aimlessly around the city, someone called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I slowly turned around. There was a girl I recognized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Naruka]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing there was a girl with her black hair stretched down to her thighs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s going on? Why are you here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m taking a walk. I told you, I obtained freedom by defeating my father. Now I’m allowed to somewhat go out―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka, who questioned me, suddenly looked at me and stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her expression turned uneasy,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki, what’s wrong? Did something happen?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka asked anxiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was trying to keep my cool… but it looks like I can’t hide this feeling in my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since I don’t want to trouble the Konohana family, I will explain what isn’t a secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the cause of Hinako acting crudely in public. That I was kicked out of the Konohana house because of that. And the surveillance of Hinako would be tightened. These are the things I told Naruka</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka, who listened to my story, said with a strange expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I find it hard to believe that Konohana-san would do something so crude in public but… from the looks of it, I’m sure of it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka looked at me with a worried face, as if I had a very gloomy attitude. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Though not as large as the Konohana family, the Miyakojima family is also large. So I kind of understand what’s going on. I’m sure Konohana-san was also struggling in some ways I don’t know about]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I didn’t tell her everything, she was able to understand the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What happened to Konohana-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know the details. But from the looks of it, she’s going to be more restricted from now on. We may not be able to do things like tea parties and study groups anymore]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see… The Konohana family is really tough. How could they bind their own daughter with just one mistake, and also kick Itsuki out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san may not even consider Hinako as his own daughter. At least until now, Keigon-san&#8217;s words and actions never reflected a feeling of care towards Hinako as a daughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s all… my fault]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unintentionally, I told my true thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I hadn’t taught her those extraneous things, none of this would&#8217;ve happened]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I only feel regret. I resolved to do my best to heal Hinako’s loneliness. And this is the result. I made Hinako suffer more than before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After all, I’m just a commoner who doesn’t know manners. …If I knew this was going to happen, I should’ve never gotten involved in the first pla―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―That’s not true!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said loudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised and astonished by the unthinkable outburst from the usual Naruka. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki, that’s not true! Itsuki is never wrong!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naruka…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Remember the old me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said while looking me straight in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was once forbidden to go out on my own! But Itsuki changed that and my world! I still remember that day vividly! It made me realize how small of a world I lived in!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka continued, looking extremely moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If it weren’t for Itsuki, I would probably still be afraid of the outside world. I wouldn’t have known the taste of candy bars, how to shop… the buzz of the streets, or the quiet atmosphere of parks. …That’s why I’m very grateful to Itsuki, more than words can express, I feel very grateful to you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka then lowered her gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And I’m sure Konohana-san is no different]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, Naruka muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She’s raised to know nothing except what she needs to know. It’s very lonely. I’m sure that Itsuki not only saved me, but also Konohana-san from that solitude]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that much, Naruka looked me in the eye again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Be more confident. Because of that is why… I-Itsuki is the one l-I…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka’s cheeks turned red as soon as she spoke the next sentence, and as she continued, she averted her gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… A-Admire that part of you…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Naruka sounded dejected as she spoke the last sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if she was trying to convey something but changed it to something else instead… Even so, Naruka’s words were enough to make my heart flutter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―That’s right.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it’s trivial for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it’s something like common sense to me, or not very interesting for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Hinako and Naruka, it could be something life changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naruka… Thank you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I thanked her, I thought back to my time at the Konohana house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was by no means a self-indulgence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Objectively speaking, it can be seen as not wrong entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Hinako didn’t feel lost and confused with me by her side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako has put a certain amount of trust in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I want to live up to that trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still haven’t responded to Hinako’s feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Alright]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the day when I made up my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako is carrying a tremendous amount of weight in such a small body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone had to be kind and gentle to her.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If her parents and servants don’t fulfill that role… Then I’ll do it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m off] (TN: ittekimasu)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Where to?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Konohana family mansion]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told Naruka who encouraged me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I just want to have a little face to face conversation]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dark mood is gone now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my confidence brought back by Naruka, I set out for the Konohana family mansion.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka watched with a faint smile on her face as Itsuki’s back faded away without looking back once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako, huh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I guess he was in a rush.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Itsuki didn’t notice the tiny slip of his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Aaahhhhh… now I’ve sent salt to the enemy…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her benefactor was in trouble, so it was only natural for her to help him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn&#8217;t regret it. But her feelings are a different story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka held her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2 of them… really, what is their relationship?</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Itsuki was on his way to the Konohana family mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door suddenly opened in front of Hinako, who was sitting on her bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A servant, Shizune, enters from behind the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama. How are you feeling?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;just like usual]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako answered lazily and lay down on her bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t go to school because it was a day off, she only attended a singular meal. The time she spent acting was also shorter than usual. Even so, she sometimes collapses due to the stress she’s been having.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, there was an inconvenient event for Hinako today.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Shizune stopped her work and visited Hinako’s room. She didn’t want anything to happen to Hinako, so she went to check on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune. …Where’s Itsuki?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki-san has already left the mansion]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Shizune replied, Hinako lowered her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… he’s only been a caretaker for a month]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s a long time]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune gave a nonchalant response to Hinako’s words, not understanding what she was thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s voice sounded stiff, sad, and disinterested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Hinako wasn’t too concerned about Itsuki&#8217;s dismissal. That’s what Shizune thought, but―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If caretakers are not needed, why not hire them as servants?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something she would never ask about other caretakers before Itsuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I heard that there’s a shortage of gardeners…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ojou-sama?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What about the cook…? Or someone who just sweeps and cleans…. Actually, there’s a lot…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune says more firmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Keigon-sama has no intentions of hiring Itsuki-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako should be able to understand such things as a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Hinako acts very well, the real Hinako has trouble expressing her emotions. That’s when Shizune realized. Hinako was so depressed she turned away from reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quietly, Hinako said</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I want to meet Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing her small wish, Shizune bit her lips and slowly opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That won’t be permitted by Keigon-sama. …You should give up, this one time. It is not a good idea to offend Keigon-sama any further]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Shizune&#8217;s words, Hinako’s lips twitched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune… whose side are you on?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m just someone employed by Keigon-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako became even more upset.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Enough. If that’s the case, I’ll go find him]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune ignored the sharp glare she received and took a bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have to help Keigon-sama with his work, so I will leave you now. I will have a guard standing by the door, just in case… so please refrain from any rash behavior] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Shizune turned around and left the room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let out a gasp when she saw the door slam shut behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Shizune doesn’t understand]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if determined to do something, Hinako tightens her grip on the futon with both her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m a woman who can do what I want…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a sparkle in her eye, Hinako sprang into action.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After parting with Naruka, I immediately went to the Konohana mansion where Hinako is in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon-san is now at that mansion. After the meal was over, he originally planned to return to the main residence, but he stopped by to check on Hinako’s life cycle. He also said he was going to work in the office, so he probably intends to stay for a while. Since I don’t know where the main residence is located, I must meet Keigon-san by the end of the day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned to the mansion again, I was stared at by 2 guards standing in front of the gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you doing back here?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His tone was cold… but his gaze was filled with sympathy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month of working as a caretaker, I was recognized by the servants of the Konohana family. The 2 gatekeepers in front of me saw me every day when Hinako and I went to and from school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let me in, please]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I refuse. If you want to enter, please follow the proper procedure] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess he wanted me to make an appointment with Keigon-san before I came in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I can’t just accept that and back down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―There was no way Keigon-san would allow me to do so even if I followed the proper procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ignored the 2 gatekeepers and headed to the gate. The gate was amazingly tall, but there were bumps and edges to it. It’d be possible to climb over it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wait]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I took a step towards the gate, the gatekeepers approached me.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you go any further, you’re a threat to us. We will take appropriate action]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a roundabout way to say they were concerned about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a reason why I can’t back down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse m―e!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With determination, I ran to the gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2 gatekeepers were surprised and rushed to me as I tried to climb up the gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This, stupid kid!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t underestimate the gatekeepers of the Konohana family] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gatekeepers pinched me from the sides. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I get caught here, I may never see Hinako again. Such thoughts would come, and my mind would become a mess. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite the situation, I was surprisingly calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the one who was surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the other party was more agitated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I quickly dived into the gatekeeper’s bosom and threw myself at him by springing my knees. The gatekeeper’s back slams into the ground and, bang! A violent sound echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gah!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned away from the screaming gatekeeper at my feet and looked at the other one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-What the hell was that..!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe not expecting a counterattack, the remaining gatekeeper trembled. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way I’m missing this opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―My body moves on its own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my mind, the self-defense techniques that Shizune-san taught me came flooding at a dizzying pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gatekeeper came to his senses and approached me, but it was too late. I quickly grabbed his arm and twisted it outwards. As soon as he was off balance, I knocked him off his footing and sent him down. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gahk!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second gatekeeper fell, as did the first. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[H-Hey you… where did you learn those techniques…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the gatekeeper grunted and groaned, I stared at my fist and thought back over the past month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember what Shizune-san said once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a great talent for self-defense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry… I’m in a hurry]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I climbed over the gate and landed on the ground on the other side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fallen gatekeeper shouted loudly</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Intruder! Seize him!]</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been working here for about a month and have a certain grasp of the structure of the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I crossed the gate, I soon hid behind the bushes and made a detour towards the back of the mansion without making a sound. Remembering the course of the servants’ rounds and guessing their positions, I moved through the land laid out by the Konohana family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where the hell is he!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Search the main gate again!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could hear the voices of the servants in the distance. I quietly held my breath so that they wouldn&#8217;t find me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, where do I enter…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I must enter the mansion, but not through the conventional way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m thinking about what to do ― Then I remembered the night walk I had with Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen door towards the back of the mansion was open. The narrow and unpopular corridor leads to the lower part of the house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Thank you, Hinako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As quickly as possible, I moved quickly towards Hinako’s favorite place. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did you find him!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, he’s not here!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I entered the mansion, many servants were shouting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a big commotion, but I have no intention of retreating. Keigon-san isn’t going to talk to me anyways. If that’s the case, I’ll force through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I found him!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geh]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Servants of the Konohana family, dressed in black, came from across the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a panic, I turned around and went up the stairs to the second floor, where I encountered another group of servants.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Get him!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relentless tackle was unrelenting. (TN: wha?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can’t―get―caught!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I leapt backwards to avoid the tackle and kicked him back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Agh, Waaah!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servant fell back down the stairs with a lot of momentum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was a short staircase, he wasn’t severely harmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-This guy! He’s tough!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Surround him and hold him!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the men approached, I calmly reminded myself of Shizune-san’s teachings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the opponent throws his arm then―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha-!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before he could get me, I sneaked below him and moved behind him while maintaining the clinch. While blocking the opponent’s action, I quickly tapped his knee with my foot, forcing him to kneel. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You, keep quiet!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding his fists, I grabbed his arm. Twisting his wrist outwards, I pushed his joints, so that he would try and escape the pain, and would naturally fall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gohk!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a technique called kotegaeshi. (TN: wristlock, left the japanese cuz new word to learn xD)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I straddled the servant who rolled on the floor and quickly ran up to the 4th floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san… Thank you very much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-defense isn’t a technique to defeat someone, but to protect oneself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, its true essence was to escape from the enemy. It’s the perfect technique for me right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As I recall, the way to the office is…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I head to the room where Keigon-san is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office was also where I first talked with Keigon-san. I couldn&#8217;t remember the whole layout in detail, but I have a vague recollection of the route.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, I thought I saw something strange in the corner of my eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped and checked to see if I could recognize it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nnnn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long, thin cloth-like object hung outside the window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloth is… a curtain. For some reason, the curtain is hanging from the upper floor, dangling and swaying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are they drying laundry? it doesn’t look like it…　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I tilted my head―A girl came down through the curtain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnnn~~~!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell is she doing!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I rushed to stop her, but before I could, Hinako went to the lower floors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh no―If she falls, we’re in trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could’ve made it to the office, but that’s not the point now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ran down the stairs and out of the mansion, and called out to Hinako above me. (EDN: Guards doko?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako! What are you doing!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at me while hanging from the curtain tied like a string.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not safe, cmon―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Limit]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ha?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a bad feeling about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can’t, hold on…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wai―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let go of the curtain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her gorgeous and slender body was flying in the air and fell down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened my arms and caught Hinako in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―Gueh!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A strong blow from the impact made me exhale all my oxygen out of my lungs. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nice catch]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-You, what are you… even doing…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I just wanted to see Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who was smiling, looked relieved when she told me this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you say a line like that with that face… I can’t get mad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have a suggestion]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Suggestion?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at Hinako’s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to ask what she was talking about when,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-Ojou-sama has been kidnappedー!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A servant who caught us through the window shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Damn!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m reluctant but… I can’t bear leaving Hinako here alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious about her suggestion, so I ran away with Hinako in my arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(insert princess carry) poggers</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I got kidnapped again]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I didn’t think I’d be the one kidnapping you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, we met because of a kidnapping.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, I had no idea I would become her kidnapper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Somehow, you did]</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hid in the bushes and was relieved to see that there was not a soul around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, what do you suggest?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I will be a hostage]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So that Itsuki can convince my dad]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Then that’s more like a threat instead of persuasion]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, just do it like so]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hesitated for a bit before giving my answer to Hinako, who was suggesting such a plan without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After giving some thoughts, I realized I can’t just agree to that plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s no good]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s not going to solve anything]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no point in being peaceful on the surface only, leaving the root of the problem alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Keigon-san is a powerful man. Even if I tried to  resolve this by force, he would overwhelm me by force as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll try to convince Keigon-san somehow. That’s the only way] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Convince… Can you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an unfounded confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I assured her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll talk him out of it, I promise]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to reassure Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want Hinako to be overwhelmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to repay Hinako for giving me a place to stay after I lost my home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, I’ll fight stubbornly no matter how far I go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where are you going with Ojou-sama?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked up at the familiar voice… and I was dripping with cold sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Shizune-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The head maid of the Konohana family, a maid who can do anything. (TN: Someone call Ein)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one person I’ve never been able to beat in my self-defense lessons―is standing right in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Securing]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after Shizune-san’s short announcement, servants approached from all directions at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kuuuuh!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they all grab me at once, I won’t be able to move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got closer to the thinnest servant, dodging a swinging fist while escaping the encirclement. The defensive techniques they had learnt so far were different from the other servants. All of them were now obtaining presence of mind and cooperation. The fact that Shizune san brought them here, means they must have been well trained servants. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the four of them, at least one was always trying to get around my blindspot. Sensing this movement, I launched a kick to the back without turning around. The sole of my foot caught a servant in the chest. The one who was kicked screamed and the remaining three let out a startled cry. Taking advantage of that, I lunged at the one in front of me and knocked him down with an overhand throw.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in the next instant, I was grabbed from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh no―!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I realized that there was a fifth person, who was approaching without a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that the first 4 were decoys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried my best to escape from the restraints, as it wasn’t too frightening.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　全力で拘こう束そくから逃れようとするが、ビクともしない</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gritted my teeth, while Shizune-san walked to me calmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m amazed at how well you’ve grown in such a short period of time. You absorbed the lessons so well that it’s obvious you work hard, however… this was beyond my expectations]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If you were complimenting me, I’d like it if you step back first]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That I cannot do]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told once only.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Shizune]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako then opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… will keep on acting]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako says as she slowly approaches me, who’s unable to move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I won’t stop acting ever again. I’ll do it flawlessly anytime, anywhere. So please… Let me be with Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san was silently surprised by Hinako’s request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering Hinako’s attitude until now, that request was unthinkable. The burden of acting should be best understood by Hinako herself. Even though she has a limited amount of free time, she was willing to give it all up to be with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why―I have to deny her request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako, stop]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I told her clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t want Hinako to take on too much burden. For that, I want to be by your side. If no one else is there, at least I want to be the one there―There to make Hinako not push herself too hard]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsu… ki…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want you to be forced to stay with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s idea, as I mentioned earlier… Is the end of the story for me.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m asking you, don’t try to throw away what I’m trying to protect, all by yourself]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Hinako, those words must be unexpected.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl standing in front of me was someone who always looked sleepy-eyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nnn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako nodded her head in a small but unmistakable way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. …I believe Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mumbled tone of her voice clearly reached my ears. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako is staring straight at me. In her eyes, she sees me staring at her in the same way. ―It was a strange feeling. I feel as if I can communicate with Hinako without exchanging words.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I apologize for being so worked up]  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here comes the problem. I glared at Shizune-san to show my will to resist, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san. Don’t worry, it won’t end the way you think it will]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I confusedly rolled my eyes at Shizune-san’s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Your accomplishments as a caretaker will soon reach the ears of Keigon-sama. Until then, please wait]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’ll wait…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know what Shizune-san is talking about.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I heard an electronic ring coming from Shizune-san. She took out her phone from the pocket of her uniform and looked at the screen.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good timing]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Shizune-san put her phone to her ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a brief conversation with someone, Shizune-san looks at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve been summoned by Keigon-sama, so I will leave you now. Please wait here for a little longer, both of you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san’s stern expression breaks and returns to the usual calm demeanor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san. …Whose side are you on?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m only someone employed by Keigon-sama] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing, Shizune-san tells us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However… I am on your side, Ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summoned by Keigon, Shizune knocked on the door of the office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the door, Shizune enters the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon was seated behind a large desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Keigon-sama, at your servic―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―Come]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune gave a small nod to Keigon, who told her shortly, and she obeyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What, the hell is this?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying that, Keigon showed several documents stacked on his desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Invitations to the social circle hosted by the Konohana family… Here are the invites. We were told you will be staying here for a while, so I have ordered the one delivered from the main residence. I wanted Keigon-sama to look over it as soon as possible]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There was no mistake in that decision. But…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon said as he looked over the documents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Describe these 4 invited guests]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon handed over 4 invitations to Shizune.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune nods, [Yes sir] and begins to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Asahi Karen-sama seems to be the daughter of J’s Holdings Inc. J’s Holdings is one of the top 5 electronic retailers in Japan, and is a major business partner for the Konohana Group]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first explanation is done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Taisho Katsuya-sama is the son of a major transportation company famous for its moving services. This is also one of the top-ranked companies in its industry, and among the Konohana Group&#8217;s clients, banks and real estate-related companies have chosen Konohana as their business partner]</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second explanation is done.</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Miyakojima Naruka-sama’s family runs one of the largest sporting goods manufacturers in Japan. Currently, the Konohana Group is not involved in the sporting goods industry, but if we can get a connection here, it could be a good starting point]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third explanation is done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And as you know, Tennouji Mirei-sama is the daughter of the Tennouji Group. They are in a competition with the Konohana Group, but as a group of the same size, we thought it would be a very important connection. If we join hands, it will certainly generate significant profits]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth explanation is done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all the explanations, Shizune added one last sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In addition, all four of them――are Ojou-sama’s schoolmates]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing Shizune’s explanation, Keigon puts his hand on his forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His expression was clearly puzzled and perplexed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Neither Asahi and Taisho has been invited before, but they’re not bad business partners]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Miyakojima was acquainted with the president, but they didn’t participate much in social gatherings. However, just a few minutes ago, the president of the company told me, “If my daughter is going to participate, I will too”, and they’ve agreed to join us for this year’s gathering]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is fortuitous. Shizune nodded, thinking inwardly. (TN: fortuitous is basically lucky)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[About Tennouji… Of course, I was acquainted with the head of the family, but this is the first time his daughter has participated in our event. Until now, our relationship has been superficial, for better or worse, but this may be an opportunity to build a stronger relationship of trust. The Tennouji family is more about people than numbers… I hope we can take the initiative first]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second half of the explanation is like a soliloquy as Keigon speaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking over the 4 invitations again, Keigon exhaled deeply before looking at Shizune.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[They are all valuable contacts. …All of these, did Hinako invite them?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She never invited anyone before… and yet, here we have all these ridiculous connections]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon says in a deep tone of confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I would like to say something, sir]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune said to Keigon, who remained silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you are pleased with Ojou-sama’s change… I would suggest it to be unwise to let go of someone who’s done so much for us]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Someone who’s done so much?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon guessed Shizune’s intention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Although we are in the process of developing a business relationship with a shipbuilding company, we have little connections with 4 major companies that can become important in the near future…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keigon compares what&#8217;s gained and what’s lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminds him of a boy he met only a month ago, whom he hired on a trial basis. His impression towards him had somehow changed―From astonishment to admiration.</span></p

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s pretty obvious which one should take priority]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer came quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting out a sigh, Keigon said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Call Itsuki-kun back]</span></p>
