<h3>Chapter 4: No Lies </h3>

<p>Maybe, it was just another normal day.</p>
<p>I took my classes seriously, ate with Hinako during my lunch break, and held study sessions with Tennouji-san after school.</p>
<p>However, after school, as I was about to change my shoes in the shoebox lockers, I saw something unusual.</p>
<p>A single envelope in my locker.</p>
<p>Seeing the white letter, I reflexively closed my locker.</p>
<p>[Are you kidding me…?]</p>
<p>A love letter.</p>
<p>…It’s a love letter!!!</p>
<p>No, no, no… That’s impossible.</p>
<p>What kind of student in the Imperial Academy falls in love with a man like me? (TN: There’s like three already)</p>
<p>It’s true I take care of my appearance as a caretaker, but there are many good looking men and women amongst the students of the academy. I’m sure that I wouldn’t have been chosen because of my appearance.</p>
<p>My social status is also ostensibly that of the son and heir of a medium-sized company. In an ordinary high school, I might be the object of admiration, but in this academy, there are many candidates for the presidency of larger companies. I still didn’t understand why they’d choose me.</p>
<p>[W-What should I do, should I tell Shizune-san…?]</p>
<p>My head was spinning and I wanted to talk to someone about it right away.</p>
<p>If this was a normal high school, I&#8217;d first think it was a prank, but surely no student would do such a thing in this academy.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and opened my locker again.</p>
<p>Fearfully I picked up the envelope and—</p>
<p>—Letter of challenge.</p>
<p>On the top of the letter were large words that were not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Huh?]</p>
<p>I stiffened for a minute and slowly turned my head.</p>
<p>Is this… a prank? At least the possibility of it being a love letter is gone. I’m both happy and sad… No, I didn’t expect any in the first place, so there’s nothing wrong with it. Let’s put it that way.</p>
<p>When I opened the letter of challenge, the time and place for the meeting were written.</p>
<p>No greetings, no nothing. It just said [After school, at the dojo]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Nn?]</p>
<p>I tilted my head when I saw the words written in a beautiful way.</p>
<p>[This is… Tennouji-san’s handwriting?]</p>
<p>Because we’ve been together for quite some time, I remember Tennouji-san’s handwriting.</p>
<p>The masterful brush strokes, as if written by a calligrapher with great enthusiasm, are typical of the strong-willed Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>At any rate, I headed for the dojo as directed.</p>
<p>At Kiou Academy, there’s a dojo next to the gymnasium. I opened the door and went inside.</p>
<p>In the center of the dojo, Tennouji-san, clad in a hakama, was sitting in a seiza.</p>
<p>[You’re finally here]</p>
<p>Slowly opening her eyelids, Tennouji-san said.</p>
<p>[Uhm Tennouji-san. What did you mean by the letter of challenge…?]</p>
<p>[First, please change into a hakama in the changing room]<br />
(EDN: An outfit used for martial arts, but also worn by shrine priests, or at least that&#8217;s what google says)</p>
<p>I felt the power in her words, and quietly followed her instructions, even though I was still confused.</p>
<p>In the men’s locker room, there was one kendo suit. I knew how to wear one because I studied self-defense in the Konohana family.</p>
<p>After changing, as I was leaving the locker room, I noticed a single shinai by the door. Should I take this with me as well? Unsure of Tennouji-san’s intentions, I picked up the shinai, tilting my head. (EDN: A shinai is a bamboo practice sword)</p>
<p>[Tennouji-san. I changed my clothes as you told me, but what is―]</p>
<p>[―Tomonari-san]</p>
<p>Standing up from her seiza position, Tennouji-san put her hand inside her hakama.</p>

<p>[What is this, I wonder?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san took out three photos.</p>
<p>She then handed me the photos, and when I saw them―My eyes widened.</p>
<p>[T-This is..!?]</p>
<p>This was a picture taken this morning, when I left the Konohana family mansion with Hinako.</p>
<p>The photos were carefully taken from three different angles, showing that the people in that photo were unmistakably me and Hinako.</p>
<p>[This morning, I had someone take a picture. …And it seems that you and Konohana-san live in the same place]</p>
<p>I recalled Shizune-san detecting an intruder this morning.</p>
<p>At that time, she brushed it off, believing she imagined things. But…. It looks like there really was an intruder.</p>
<p>[That’s… It was a family affair, and I was sent to the Konohana family…]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Then let me change the question. Where and with whom did you spend lunch with today?]</p>
<p>This time, I couldn’t answer her question.</p>
<p>Her suspicions were confirmed this morning. I’m sure that’s why Tennouji-san has been observing me and Hinako all day today. I was on the lookout for the shadows around me…. But the Tennouji family is on par with the Konohana family.</p>
<p>[Then, I take that silence as affirmation]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said while lowering her gaze.</p>
<p>[In other words, you were betraying me?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said that while keeping her gaze sharp at me.</p>
<p>[I didn’t mean to betray you, it’s not like that…]</p>
<p>[Stand up]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san pointed her shinai at me and shouted.</p>
<p>[That twisted mind and heart of yours―I’ll crush all of that!!]</p>
<p>She swung her shinai down.</p>
<p>[Uaaa!?]</p>
<p>It was a powerful blow, not what you would normally expect from a woman.</p>
<p>I avoided it just in time and the shinai missed the tip of my nose.</p>
<p>[P-Please wait, Tennouji-san!]</p>
<p>[I won’t wait!!]</p>
<p>Again, a swing aimed at my head was imminent.</p>
<p>Right now we’re only wearing hakama and no protective gear. We might injure each other if we don’t dodge. (TN: dodge best in the game fr)</p>
<p>I hurriedly held my shinai to the side and tried to defend myself, then―Tennouji-san turned her wrist and changed her trajectory.</p>
<p>[Kote~!!] (TN: Kote is the name of gloves used in Kendo, and is a viable target for a strike in Kendo)</p>
<p>[&#8230;Ugh!?]</p>
<p>A sharp pain ran through my wrist.</p>
<p>Tenonuji-san is serious. …But that doesn’t mean I can fight back seriously. The other party is the daughter of the Tennouji family. If she were to get hurt, it could lead to a big problem.</p>
<p>[You were…!]</p>
<p>While swinging her shinai down, Tennouji-san starts to yell.</p>
<p>[Y-You were…! You were making fun of me this whole time…!!]</p>
<p>When our eyes met, I saw that her eyes were wet.</p>
<p>[While I was competing against Konohana Hinako… You were pretending to cooperate with me… and laughing behind my back all this time…..!!]</p>
<p>Hearing those words in a trembling voice, I realized.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san, she―misunderstood me.</p>
<p>[T-That’s not it!!]</p>
<p>I said as I received her shinai with my own.</p>
<p>[It’s true that I’ve been taken care of by the Konohana family! I apologize for not telling you that! But I am spending time with Tennouji-san because I want to! Hinako has nothing to do with this!]</p>
<p>[Keep your mouth shut…! I can’t trust a word you say, you traitor!!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san pushed down her shinai.</p>
<p>I wondered where in the world her thin arms held such power. I began to break out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>I lied to Tennouji-san. That… could be considered as betrayal.</p>
<p>I lied to her about my identity, about my background, and hid my true feelings from her. Tennouji-san trusted me and even confided in me that she was adopted… but I betrayed her trust.</p>
<p>[Tennouji-san… It’s not like that. I’m really not laughing at you, Tennouji-san]</p>
<p>[You have no excuse!]</p>
<p>That’s right. Every word out of my mouth is an excuse.</p>
<p>I understand why Tennouji-san is so angry.</p>
<p>It’s because of how much she believed in me.</p>
<p>What about me, on the other hand?</p>
<p>I said I didn’t betray her and that Hinako had nothing to do with this, but… in the end, Tennouji-san didn’t believe anything I told her.</p>
<p>Is Tennouji-san an untrustworthy person?</p>
<p>No, she isn’t. In fact, there’s probably few people who can be trusted as much as Tennouji-san. I’m sure that no matter what she says, she will always tell the truth.</p>
<p>[I admit, I did lie]</p>
<p>I said as I caught Tennouji-san’s shinai.</p>
<p>[I admit that I did hide some things. But… it wasn’t to hurt Tennouji-san]</p>
<p>[I told you already, no more excuses!]</p>
<p>Right now, Tennouji-san is confused. That’s why my words won’t reach her.</p>
<p>I’m sure that Tennouji-san would understand if she were calm. She may suspect something insidious, like bullying… but who would spend every day after school together or take strict lessons just for that?</p>
<p>[That much is true]</p>
<p>[I told you, I don’t believe you―]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san tried to swing down her sword once again.</p>
<p>Just before that, I moved my right arm forward and grabbed Tennouji-san’s shinai to stop her.</p>
<p>[&#8230;It’s true]</p>
<p>I’ll tell you all about me.</p>
<p>I made up my mind while gripping my shinai.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you everything.</p>
<p>Just like Tennouji-san believed in me―I want to believe in Tennouji-san too.</p>

<p>[Then, shall we hear your explanation?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said, regaining her composure and staring straight at me.</p>
<p>In the center of the dojo, the air was tense between us and we sat down facing each other.</p>
<p>[Actually―]</p>
<p>I was honest about my situation.</p>
<p>About how I wasn’t the heir of a medium-sized company and how I was a servant of the Konohana family. I explained it all.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t say anything about Hinako’s true nature.</p>
<p>I couldn’t say that much. It was a matter deeply related to the entire Konohana family. And besides, taking only me in consideration, I hesitated to disclose Hinako’s secret without permission.</p>
<p>[I see… I see, I see, I see…]</p>
<p>After hearing the explanation, Tennouji-san nodded her head repeatedly.</p>
<p>[You’re actually the eldest son of a poor family, not the heir apparent of an IT company, and you are now working for Konohana Hinako, and as part of that, you’ve become a student at the Academy. The reason you didn’t tell anyone is because you didn’t want to cause any trouble for the Konohana family that picked you up. …It’s hard to believe out of blue, but it makes sense]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san looked convinced.</p>
<p>Then she looked at me with still eyes and said,</p>
<p>[Impostor]</p>
<p>She told me shortly.</p>
<p>[You are a fraud desuwa]</p>
<p>[&#8230;I can’t deny that]</p>
<p>I couldn’t even refute her claim and I bowed my head.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.The way you talk]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[The way you talk is also an act, is it not? When you stopped my shinai, it seemed like your tone changed]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Well]</p>
<p>It was not as big of an act as she made it sound like, but it was certainly not my normal tone of voice.</p>
<p>Just because you’re a student at the Imperial Academy doesn’t mean you have to use honorifics. In fact, my classmates, Taisho and Asahi-san, used a frank tone to everyone.</p>
<p>[You should return to your original tone of voice]</p>
<p>[&#8230;However]</p>
<p>[I told you to change it back]</p>
<p>She said in an overwhelming force.</p>
<p>In any case, since it had already become like this, there was no use in covering it up.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Alright]</p>
<p>When I returned to my original tone under Tennouji-san’s pressure, Tennouji-san looked surprised.</p>
<p>[So… It’s true that you had such a tone]</p>
<p>After telling me so with a mysterious look on her face, Tennouji-san looked at me again with sharp eyes.</p>
<p>[Promise me. Promise me from now on, you’ll never lie in front of me, not only in words, but also your actions]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san continued.</p>
<p>[If you keep that promise, I promise to continue our relationship as before]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Are you sure…? Acting the same as usual?]</p>
<p>[I told you. I’m confident in my ability to see through people. …You ultimately decided to follow through your lie out of respect for the wishes of the Konohana family rather than for yourself, so I can’t just dismiss it outright]</p>
<p>Even in this situation, Tennouji-san was a charismatic person through and through.</p>
<p>In fact, Tennouji-san wouldn&#8217;t do anything that would put others in a disadvantage. Depending on the situation she would distinguish what should and shouldn&#8217;t be said.</p>
<p>[It’s inevitable that you have something to hide. But from now on, please say that you can’t say what you can’t say. That’s what it means to not lie]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Alright. Uhm, Tennouji-san, I won’t lie in front of you anymore]</p>
<p>When I said this, Tennouji-san looked like she just thought of something.</p>
<p>[Since this is a good chance, let’s change the way we call each other, shall we? …When we’re alone, can you just call me Mirei?]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;What’s with that surprised face? You should feel honored]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san pouted in protest.</p>
<p>[I, too, will call you Itsuki-san. …That will be my cue when talking to the real you]</p>
<p>I see… that might come in handy.</p>
<p>When we’re around other people, we will call each other as we usually do, and when we can let our guard down, we will change the way we call each other. Oddly enough, I already have that kind of relationship with Hinako, so it doesn’t feel that strange to me.</p>
<p>[Then… Mirei]</p>
<p>I called Tennouji-san’s name to try it out.</p>
<p>Then, Tennouji-san’s face turned red.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san became silent. It looked like she was desperately trying to push down her agitation.</p>
<p>[Mirei?]</p>
<p>[M-Maybe let’s not do this after all]</p>
<p>[Eh…?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san played with her golden hair with her fingertips and stuttered as she looked away.</p>
<p>[I-I can’t stay calm, so… you can continue calling me as you have in the past. I’m going to call you Itsuki-san]</p>
<p>Huh, well that’s that. If Tennouji-san’s fine with it, then I’m not opposed to it.</p>
<p>[Anyways, from today and onwards, you won’t lie to me. In order to maintain a fair relationship, I won’t lie to you either. …You too, if you have anything you want to ask, just ask]</p>
<p>[Even if you say anything, I’m not sure what to ask…]</p>
<p>When being put on the spot, it’s no easy task to just come up with a question.</p>
<p>I had thought that at first, but there was one thing about Tennouji-san that had been bothering me for some time. However, I decided it wasn’t the time to ask… yet.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.I don’t have anything to ask]</p>
<p>[Just now, your eyes were looking around]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san didn’t miss my momentary hesitation.</p>
<p>[Geez. I don’t see why you’re being so hesitant now]</p>
<p>[No… I just thought that, I didn’t really care that much about it]</p>
<p>[I already told you I wouldn’t lie. Besides, I would be more concerned if you were to hesitate in this situation… Just go ahead and ask me anything]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Then]</p>
<p>The actual person is telling me to ask, so I’ll ask her honestly.</p>
<p>[Your hair, it’s actually dyed, isn’t it?]</p>
<p>[―!?]</p>
<p>When I asked my question, a strange [Hngh] spilled out of Tennouji-san’s mouth.</p>
<p>[W-W-What kind of question are you asking!? can’t you read the mood!?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.But, I’ve been wondering about it for a long time]</p>
<p>[I-I never thought that I’d get strangled so soon…. As I thought, you’re a fraud..!!!]</p>
<p>I don’t think this one is my fault.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Dyed it]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[I dyed it, okay!? Is there a problem with that!?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san’s face turned red as she admitted it.</p>
<p>I shook my head, but it was not that I had anything to complain about. Then, Tennouji-san regained her composure and the flush on her face faded.</p>
<p>[&#8230;I dyed my hair gold ever since I was a child to look appropriate as the eldest daughter of the Tennouji family. …The same goes to my peculiar tone desuwa]</p>
<p>[Ahhh, I knew that you did that one on purpose]</p>
<p>[Of course desuwa. …And now, I can no longer go back]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said with a complicated face.</p>
<p>Indeed, as someone who knows the usual Tennouji-san, it may be difficult to imagine Tennouji-san with black hair and a normal tone of voice. I worry that she may have done something unnecessary.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.Let me ask just one more thing]</p>
<p>I realized just now that I forgot an important question.</p>
<p>[Is there anyone other than Tennouji-san who knows I’m being taken care of by the Konohana family?]</p>
<p>[No, it’s just me. I personally commissioned the entire investigation. …It was my mother who first suspected you… but I’ll deceive her later]</p>
<p>[&#8230;I see]</p>
<p>Thank you, I tried to say that… but I just kept my mouth shut.</p>
<p>[Is something wrong?]</p>
<p>[No… I was just thinking that now I’ve been exposed, I might not be able to stay at the academy much longer]</p>
<p>[&#8230;!!]</p>
<p>Keeping quiet about this to Hinako and Shizune-san wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>I believe in Tennouji-san. And I’m still convinced that she would never leak any information that she learned today with anyone.</p>
<p>But… Keigon-san surely wouldn&#8217;t allow it.</p>
<p>While thinking about it, I noticed that Tennouji-san looked sad.</p>
<p>[I-I’m sorry, because of my persistent questioning…. I wasn’t thinking that far ahead]</p>
<p>[&#8230;No, it isn’t Tennouji-san’s fault]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san misunderstood and I quickly corrected her.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san isn’t responsible for this matter at all. Because―</p>
<p>[I didn’t want to lie to Tennouji-san any more than I already had]</p>
<p>Right now, I’m not sure if I’m smiling properly.</p>
<p>Who knows what the future has in store for me.</p>
<p>All will be revealed after I return to the mansion today.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san, thank you for working hard with Tennouji-sama today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned, Shizune-san greeted me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was obligated to report to Shizune-san about what had happened today. I clenched my fists in nervousness, took a deep breath and opened my mouth. I clenched my fists, took a deep breath</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm… Shizune-san. I’d like to talk to you about something]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What a coincidence. I do too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like Shizune-san also had something to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no idea what it was. …But I was sure mine was more important this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, I would like to ask what Itsuki-sama wants to talk about]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly told her about everything that happened today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Tennouji-san discovered who I really was, and―how I was the one who willingly revealed it. I was nervous, but I explained in detail as if I was trying to atone for my sin.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I didn’t tell her about Hinako’s true self, but other than that, I’ve… already explained it all]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san noded with a solemn expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m glad you’re being honest]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was afraid of what kind of punishment I’d get, but Shizune-san acted as if she was impressed. My eyes widened, not understanding what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just now, I received a call from Tennouji Mirei-sama. She asked for you to not be expelled from the academy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was astonished by those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have heard about the general situation. …Mirei-sama seems to have regretted that she suspected Itsuki-san more than necessary because she couldn’t keep her cool. Mirei-sama claimed full responsibility]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But that’s not…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, Tennouji-san… she contacted Shizune-san right after we parted ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san is that kind of person. While I was surprised, I was also convinced that this is how she does things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As expected of the daughter of the Tennouji family. She knew about Itsuki-san’s status and went through the trouble of contacting me by name. She must’ve sensed that if she suddenly reported the matter to Keigon-sama, Itsuki-san’s position would be jeopardized. …I will inform Keigon-sama from my side. The first thing to do is to make sure you have the right information and right tools. Since it’s come to this, firing you is likely to create a feud with the Tennouji family] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Tennouji-san had not called, I might’ve been fired as punishment. However, thanks to Tennouji-san’s desperate attempt to protect me, the Konohana family came to the conclusion that if they fired me, they might have a falling out with the Tennouji family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You were saved]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I also feel responsible for this matter. …If it’s the Tennouji family, there’s a limit to how much we can manipulate information. We may need to take more measures]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said with a serious look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I realized she was looking at Hinako from beyond the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to her, Hinako walked over with a small stride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The two of you… What’s wrong?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually, it seems that Itsuki-san’s true identity has been discovered by Tennouji-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s sleepy eyes slowly widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki, how…? Don’t tell me… you’re going to get fired..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think you have to worry about that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san told her bluntly.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Hinako walked next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ouch]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She kicked me lightly in the shin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Don’t make me worry like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I apologize to Hinako, who was pouting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… how did she find out…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I didn’t want to lie to Tennouji-san more than I already had. Tennouji-san isn’t the kind of person who would do detrimental things to others… and I decided I could trust her]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Muu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Hinako lets out a grumbling voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… trusts her quite a bit]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. I trust her a lot, but you also know that Tennouji-san is that kind of person, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.That’s true, but…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let out more grumbling noises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki’s an idiot]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ehh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako then turned away and left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look at her back, feeling stunned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[S-Shizune-san. Did… did I just make Hinako hate me…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that’s not what she intended to do…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san put her hand to her forehead and let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.What am I supposed to do about this?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At night, I finished my studies as usual and straightened my back lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I checked the answers to the questions I solved, I noticed a lower percentage of correct answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t concentrate today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.I made them worried, huh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san and Hinako, I feel responsible for making them anxious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was by no means Tennouji-san’s fault. The fact that I lied, and the fact that Tennouji-san caught on, was all because of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the textbook and decided I would study a little more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s do one more, as I thought that… A knock came from the door of my room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;? Come in]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was unusual for someone to visit at this hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the door opened, I saw Shizune-san and Hinako standing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who was apparently being led to my room by Shizune-san, entered with small footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, who was behind the door, looked at me silently, nodded, and left. Shizune-san was just accompanying Hinako to show her the way and had no business with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door closed, leaving me alone with Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako often visited my room and slept in my bed instead of her own, so I wasn’t that nervous anymore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Errr, why did you come here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.No reason]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looks like she doesn’t have any errands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the looks of it, she wasn’t in a bad mood…. but, when we made eye contact, I bowed my head as an apology for what happened today.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry that I  worried you today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako layed down on my bed, slowly sinking into it.                        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If Itsuki gets fired… I’d be in trouble]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said as she hugged the pillow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I get fired, it’s a given that I’d be in trouble. However, by extension, Hinako would also be in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to be more careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What more should I do to be more aware of that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Speaking of which, how does Hinako always act?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Hinako as she hugged her pillow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Why?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think, from now on I’ll have to behave better than ever before. …I’m sure Hinako acts naturally now, but when you’re at the academy, you act like a lady, right? I’d like to know how you switch between the two]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I explained the intent of my question, Hinako nodded as if she got the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako thought for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnn… I didn’t do anything strange. …I just learned it before I knew it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought it&#8217;d be something kind of like a Konohana-style hypnosis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure if I can honestly be impressed by her saying she somehow learned how to do it out of the blue. Did she adapt on her own volition? …Or was she brought into an environment where she had no choice but to do so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Hinako didn’t really care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, can Hinako, for example, still act like you do when you’re at the academy if you wanted to?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn… I can]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stood up slowly, shaking her sleepiness off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako approached me as I sat on my chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the distance between us was the same as it was in the classroom, Hinako straightened her back quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Tomonari-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Woow]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tone of her voice, her gestures, everything changed in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My lips twitched in surprise at the sudden appearance of Hinako Ojou-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Woow… what?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-No, sorry. I was just surprised…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hurriedly apologized to the disgruntled Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The switch was smooth… or rather, more slippery than I imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s so easy for you to switch in between…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn. …When I’m at the academy, I feel cramped, but I can take it easy here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she doesn’t feel uncomfortable acting here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad that’s the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ah, but, this isn’t the academy… so you can call me by my name] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako seemed to have noticed something, and let out a complicated expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Hinako, who switched back to her Ojou-sama mode, looked me in the face and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Itsuki-kun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt my heart skip a beat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She just called my name, but I was shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong, Itsuki-kun?  You look a little pale…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-No…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako at the academy is under a lot of stress and yet she acts under that pressure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why, I never thought that….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(This… the destructive power she has is amazing) (EDN: What kind of play is this…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the first time I got called by my name by this Hinako. So I felt as if an unobtainable flower, which I could never reach, had snuggled up to me just for my own sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl in front of me was called the perfect Ojou-sama for a reason.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4785" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00014-1-215x300.jpeg" alt="" width="625" height="872" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00014-1-215x300.jpeg 215w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00014-1-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00014-1.jpeg 463w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I now clearly understood why she was the “most prestigious” student at the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-kun?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered that Hinako was so good-looking that 10 out of 10 people would turn their heads to look at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, what is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako tilted her head slightly while still in Ojou-sama mode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was too nervous to talk to her like this, so―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s potato chips]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ehhh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako instantly returned to her natural state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s eyes lit up as I pulled a bag of chips from the drawer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san gave it to me as a last resort if Hinako wouldn’t listen to me when I was working as her caretaker, but recently Hinako has been cooperating so much that I had spares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So good~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who received the potato chips, acted like she normally did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m more comfortable with this Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However… When I think about it calmly, it might have been a bad idea to give snacks this late at night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Don’t tell Shizune-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako nodded with a full smile on her face.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

p>After school the following day, I headed to the gym for a dance lesson with Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[Ah…Tennouji-san]</p>
<p>I changed into my workout clothes in the changing room and went inside the gym, where I saw Tennouji-san who had just gotten changed like me.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san looked at me, then quickly looked around.</p>
<p>[Itsuki-san]</p>
<p>She gave the signal.</p>
<p>Right now, there’s no one here but us.</p>
<p>Then, I can go back to my usual attitude―After all, I had been talking to her in a polite tone. I’m not sure if Tennouji-san gave me the permission to do so, but I decided to let loose.</p>
<p>[Uhm… I’m looking forward to another lesson with you today]</p>
<p>[What are you so nervous about?]</p>
<p>When I awkwardly greeted her, Tennouji–san giggled.</p>
<p>I felt embarrassed, but it also helped me to relax.</p>
<p>[You called the Konohana family yesterday, didn’t you? …That greatly helped me. If it weren’t for that, I might’ve been expelled.]</p>
<p>[You needn’t worry about it. I feel responsible for it]</p>
<p>With a mysterious look on her face, Tennouji-san said.</p>
<p>[Actually, today, I observed you secretly…. and you certainly behaved like a follower of Konohana Hinako. You’re always by her side casually and you prepare to rush in as soon as something happens… Really, Konohana Hinako is very blessed]</p>
<p>[I’m relieved to hear you say that. Well, to be honest, I have my hands full]</p>
<p>[No need to be modest. Perhaps you’ve been trained by the servants of the Konohana family. You’re at least good enough to be a servant]</p>
<p>That said, Tennouji-san looked a little down.</p>
<p>[Honestly, it’s enviable… I wish you could be my servant] (TN: You mean husband)</p>
<p>Tennouji-san muttered something.</p>
<p>[Did you say anything?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;No, it’s nothing]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said with a slightly grumpy attitude.</p>
<p>Maybe I said something that might’ve offended her…?</p>
<p>[Anyways, Itsuki-san. …What are you doing with Konohana Hinako during your lunch break? I know that both of you go to the old student building..]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san glared at me.</p>
<p>The only thing I did during my lunch break today was feed Hinako her lunch and put her on my lap so she could take a nap….</p>
<p>[What did I do… we just ate lunch]</p>
<p>[If all you did was eat, you could just do that in a classroom. Aren’t you doing something else?]</p>
<p>As expected of Tennouji-san, she has great intuition. So, I had no choice but to―</p>
<p>[&#8230;Please don’t question it further]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Houuu]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>[I’m asking just to be sure, you’re not doing anything wrong, are you?]</p>
<p>[Well, that’s…]</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered that I gave Hinako a lap pillow.</p>
<p>I wonder if that would be considered impure in the eyes of the public. No, but…since both parties gave their consent, I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem. (TN: By that logic, if 2 people consented incest, they would be fine and the world would be a hellhole by now)</p>
<p>[&#8230;That’s, I don’t think so]</p>
<p>[Why did you pause there?]</p>
<p>[I didn’t]</p>
<p>The anxiety in my head seemed to have manifested in my words.</p>
<p>I quickly assured her, but it was a little too late, and Tennouji-san became even more doubtful.</p>
<p>[A-As I thought, you and Konohana Hinako have some kind of special relationship…!!]</p>
<p>[Even if you say that… What makes you think so?]</p>
<p>[A hunch desuwa!!]</p>
<p>[A hunch is it…]</p>
<p>In other words, she has no evidence at all.</p>
<p>[&#8230;If I were to guess, I’d say something a little more intimate than an average servant]</p>
<p>[I-Intimate…?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san frowned.</p>
<p>[&#8230;How close?]</p>
<p>[How close what?]</p>
<p>[As I’ve said! How close are you!? There are a lot of ways that show it, just from talking to each other or when passing one another!!]</p>
<p>That’s something I’d do with strangers, let alone someone close to me.</p>
<p>Why am I being asked this question? I asked myself, wondering.</p>
<p>[For example, maybe we have a quick chat]</p>
<p>[W-well, there’s nothing weird with that, is there? I do that as well]</p>
<p>[And, as I said before, we have dinner together]</p>
<p>[&#8230;T-That’s also not a problem. I did that too]</p>
<p>[Also… I give her headpats]</p>
<p>[I don’t do that!!!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san yelled.</p>
<p>Shit. I was let go easily twice in a row, so I slipped.</p>
<p>[Patting her head!? Patting her HEAD!? What kind of situation is that!?]</p>
<p>[N-No, you know, it’s just sometimes, the mood is like that]</p>
<p>[What kind of mood causes that to happen!?]</p>
<p>Bang! Tennouji-san stepped on the floor strongly.</p>
<p>It was difficult to explain what we do. When I was lost for an answer, Tennouji-san’s face turned bright red.</p>
<p>[You should… also stroke my head]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Yes?]</p>
<p>[My head! Mine! Pet it! Me–Tennouji Mirei! I can’t let Konohana Hinako get ahead of me!!] (TN: Our tsundere Ojou-sama everyone, TSKR :pray:)</p>
<p>First is…</p>
<p>What exactly is she trying to compete with Hinako for?</p>
<p>[Then…]</p>
<p>I reached out to Tennouji-san’s head because she’d be angry if I didn&#8217;t pat her.</p>
<p>[Fuaa~&#8230;]</p>
<p>When I patted her head, Tennouji-san let out a strange sound.</p>
<p>Despite Tennouji-san’s stout personality, her hair was soft as silk. It felt different from Hinako’s hair. Tennouji-san’s whorl was just slightly off center.</p>
<p>As I continued to stroke her little head for a while… Tennouji-san’s cheeks turned bright red and she fell silent. I was afraid to call out to her.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.Tennouji-san?]</p>
<p>[HAA–!?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san’s eyes widened as if she snapped back to reality.</p>
<p>When I withdrew my hand, Tennouji-san coughed in an obviously distracting way.</p>
<p>[Ehem. I’m sorry…. I was just thinking about something]</p>
<p>[Thinking…?]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>It didn’t look like that to me, but I’ll keep quiet because I’m afraid of opening Pandora&#8217;s Box… if I try mentioning it.</p>
<p>[Ah, you do this kind of thing… with Konohana Hinako?]</p>
<p>[Well…]</p>
<p>When I affirmed her statement, Tennouji-san wrinkled her brows.</p>
<p>[Fu-fufufu… Konohana Hinako and I seem to have an incompatible relationship after all desuwa…!!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san squeezed her fist and muttered.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.I’ll start the lesson]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[I said I’m starting the lesson!!]</p>
<p>[Y-Yes!]</p>
<p>For some reason, Tennouji-san was very angry.</p>
<p>[There, you’re moving too slow!!]</p>
<p>An hour had passed since the lesson started.</p>
<p>Whenever I made a wrong move, Tennouji-san was quick to point it out.</p>
<p>[S-Somehow, you seem more strict than usual…]</p>
<p>[I’m not going to go easy on a cheater!!]</p>
<p>[That’s… I can’t refute that]</p>
<p>I realized that my legs and back were exhausted. If it were just physical strength, I would’ve been as strong as Tennouji-san, but I was probably more tired than her because I was wasting a lot of time and energy in my movements.</p>
<p>After another hour or so, we stopped.</p>
<p>[Then, let’s call it a day]</p>
<p>[T-Thank you very much…]</p>
<p>I bowed and wiped the sweat dripping from my cheeks with the back of my hand.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san also stretched her collar and wiped the sweat from her face. I looked away as her clothes lifted to reveal her thin and white waist.</p>
<p>[As usual, you’re a fast learner]</p>
<p>[&#8230;I don’t really feel like that though]</p>
<p>[It’s not flattery whatsoever. What normally takes two days to learn, you learn in only half a day. …After all, your ambition helps you grow tremendously]</p>
<p>After saying that, Tennouji-san looked like she thought of something.</p>
<p>[Is something wrong?]</p>
<p>[No, I’m just now becoming aware of my hobbies and interests. …Apparently, I like people who make an effort]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said abruptly.</p>
<p>She probably said it unconsciously. But her line just now was hard for me to ignore.</p>
<p>[Errr, that… by like, you mean…]</p>
<p>[Please don’t misunderstand that!! It meant respect as a person!!]</p>
<p>[A-Ahhh, so that’s what…]</p>
<p>[Of course! Otherwise—]</p>
<p>Tennouij-san looked as if she came back to her senses.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Otherwise, I shouldn’t]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san mumbled with a mysterious look on her face.</p>
<p>Lately, Tennouji-san has been making this face often. I was at a loss for a response, so I decided to change the subject for the time being.</p>
<p>[Come to think of it, Tennouji-san said she was adopted, but it doesn’t really feel that way. Unlike me, you don’t seem to be like a commoner…]</p>
<p>[I was raised in the Tennouji family since I can remember, and in that sense, I don’t need to change my behavior, unlike Itsuki-san, so I didn’t have to put as much effort into it]</p>
<p>I, who was raised as a commoner, first had to make an effort to act in an upper-class behavior in order to fit into the academy. Although Tennouji-san is an adopted child, she was raised by the Tennouji family since she was an infant, so unlike me, she didn’t experience the need to change.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t mean that Tennouji-san doesn’t work harder than I do. Living as the daughter of the Tennouji family… that heavy responsibility is a huge pressure I don’t have.</p>
<p>[So you don’t know much about the commoner life, do you, Tennouji-san?]</p>
<p>[That’s right. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t interested]</p>
<p>Among the students of the academy, there are only some who know the life of commoners. Narika, for example, seems to visit candy stores often.</p>
<p>[But… right now, I have to concentrate on my studies in order to win against Konohana Hinako]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san had a serious expression as she said this.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.I’ve been thinking about this for a while, but Tennouji-san likes to win, doesn’t she?]</p>
<p>[Yeah. Originally I just tried to aim to do my best for the Tennouji family… Before I knew it, it became a core part of my nature]</p>
<p>That seemed very like Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[I don’t know… what will happen to my future, especially at this time, depending on the arranged marriage. I must settle things with Konohana Hinako while I still can]</p>
<p>[&#8230;In the future?]</p>
<p>She looked very determined, and I suddenly had a question.</p>
<p>[The future… could it be different because of the arranged marriage?]</p>
<p>[Yes. Worst case scenario, I would have to leave the academy]</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>My eyes widened hearing those words.</p>
<p>[The person whom I’m arranged with lives a little far from here. …He wants us to live together as soon as possible, so I will probably leave the academy as soon as it’s set in stone]</p>
<p>[W-Wait a minute. Why so suddenly…]</p>
<p>[It can’t be helped. I also just heard about it last night]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said calmly.</p>
<p>[This is what it means to accept an arranged marriage. …I will follow the wishes of the family and work hard for the sake of the two families. I’m in a position where I’m no longer free to do what I want…]</p>
<p>Saying so, Tennouji-san’s lips shut tightly.</p>
<p>The confidence that was always there was no longer present in Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[I know I’ve asked this many times… but, let me ask again. Does Tennouji-san really feel happy about this arranged marriage?]</p>
<p>To my question, Tennouji-san looked sad for a moment.</p>
<p>No lies. Tennouji-san was the one who told me so.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san closed her eyes and made an elegant smile… while saying.</p>
<p>[I’ll stay silent about it]</p>
<p>Somehow… It’s like she already gave her answer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The next day.</p>
<p>In the classroom where class was over and was currently on break, I sighed deeply.</p>
<p>[Yo, Tomonari. You seem to be down]</p>
<p>[What is it~? If you need advice, we’re here for you, you know?]</p>
<p>Taisho and Asahi-san came over.</p>
<p>They always come to me when they want me to talk to them. It’s not a coincidence that both of them are mood makers in the class. Both are very attentive, if they sense that someone needs help, they may unconsciously call out to them.</p>
<p>[Um, I have to ask you two… what is the process of an arranged marriage?]</p>
<p>[Eh!? Tomonari-kun, don’t tell me, you’ve been approached about a potential matchmaking!?]</p>
<p>[No, it’s not about me, it’s about my friend] (EDN: Finally, someone is actually asking for a friend)</p>
<p>[Oh what? I thought I had been betrayed]</p>
<p>Betrayed? I tilted my head and Asahi-san explained.</p>
<p>[Nowadays, only a few big companies have arranged marriages~. From our social status, I think it’s best to describe that arranged marriages are like a ball and a chain]</p>
<p>[Sometimes, even at our level of status, our parents will suggest that we get engaged. But it’s not so formal as to be called an arranged marriage… and of course, you have the right to veto it]</p>
<p>Taisho added to Asahi-san’s explanation.</p>
<p>Betrayed is… I guess he thought I became a gold digger.</p>
<p>[Is it normal to veto an arranged marriage in the first place?]</p>
<p>[It depends on the house… Really, I can only say it depends on the parents]</p>
<p>Taisho said with a difficult face.</p>
<p>[At the level of Konohana-san, there may be no veto rights, but that’s usually a pattern that has been firmly explained from an early age… I don’t think they’re doing it too forcefully because the world’s eyes are strict these days? If the groove of the parent and child is too deep, it may conflict with the company’s management later]</p>
<p>In the case of Hinako, an arranged marriage wasn’t decided due to her personality.</p>
<p>I was convinced by Asahi-san’s explanation, and I arrived at one conclusion.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san… if she feels like that, she can refuse the arranged marriage.</p>
<p>But, she won’t refuse. Perhaps the reason for that is because she was adopted.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san wanted to return the favor to the Tennouji family who raised her. Therefore, she never intended to refuse the marriage from the start. Considering her determination, she’d surely accept any partner. In her eyes, she didn’t have the option to refuse from the start.</p>
<p>But, is that really the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Is it right for me to support Tennouji-san’s decision?</p>
<p>—There’s no way.</p>
<p>I couldn’t pretend that I didn’t notice. I’ve already seen evidence several times.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san isn’t interested in the proposal. She’s shown signs of that many times.</p>
<p>When the idea of the arranged marriage came up, Tennouji-san seemed gloomier than usual. When I asked her if she was okay with it, she replied, [I’ll keep quiet about it], I wasn’t stupid enough to miss such an obvious sign.</p>
<p>[Tomonari-kun, are you okay? You look conflicted…]</p>
<p>[I’m fine. I was just thinking about how to ruin an arranged marriage]</p>
<p>[Are you really okay!?]</p>
<p>Asahi-san sounded astonished.</p>
<p>[Well, I don’t know about you, but… I don’t think you should do that, right?]</p>
<p>[It happens all the time in fiction, though. The protagonist interrupts an arranged marriage to save the heroine who’s about to get married reluctantly, and snatches the bride. I’d like to do that once myself~&#8230;]</p>
<p>[If Taisho-kun did it, it’d be more like a comedy than a drama]</p>
<p>[Shut up! I’m cool when I’m serious too!]</p>
<p>[Yes yes]</p>
<p>Asahi-san brushed aside Taisho’s agitated reaction in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>[In reality, the smartest way to solve this problem is for the two parties to discuss it among themselves. In this day and age, the probability of a successful marriage proposal isn’t very high, and even the other party must take into account the possibility of rejection to some extent. If you think about it that way, the hurdle to veto becomes lower…]</p>
<p>Asahi-san put her finger to her chin and spoke thoughtfully.</p>
<p>[But you know, I hear that marriage is all about compromise]</p>
<p>[Ughh, I don’t want to hear about it. Dreamless stories are poison for children]</p>
<p>[At least half the students at the academy are heirs to their company since they were children]</p>
<p>Asahi-san said with a wry smile to Taisho, who had covered both his ears.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been heirs to their companies since they’re children. Because of that, her words left a strong impression on my ears.</p>
<p>[By the way Tomonari-kun, are you doing something with Tennouji today?]</p>
<p>[Yes. Until a while ago, I was taught etiquette, but we decided to concentrate on studying today because the competency tests are approaching]</p>
<p>[Hmmm~]</p>
<p>Asahi-san gave a suggestive nod.</p>
<p>[Rumor has it that the two of you have been in a somewhat good mood lately, you know?]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[I mean~ Tomonari-kun is popular, isn’t he? Tennouji-san is just as popular as Konohana-san, right? How many boys dream of being liked by those two?]</p>
<p>At Asahi-san’s remark, Taisho shook his head with a serious face, saying [I’m one of them].</p>
<p>Not long ago, Tennouji-san and I had a light disagreement, but before I knew it, people around me seemed to think we had a good mood going between us. In fact, I feel that revealing my true identity has brought me closer to Tennouji-san. This is exactly what it means by the phrase it rains and the ground hardens.<br />
(EDN: If you didn’t know, it’s an idiom that means people get closer after fighting)</p>
<p>Anyways, I must clear up this misunderstanding for the sake of Tennouji-san’s honor.</p>
<p>[&#8230;It’s really not that kind of relationship]</p>
<p>[Well, I had a feeling that’d be the case. But Tomonari-kun, you seem to be enjoying every moment these days]</p>
<p>[Well… at least I’m enjoying myself]</p>
<p>If that’s how I felt from Asahi-san’s point of view, then there’s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>As I told Tennouji-san directly, I enjoy learning various things from her.</p>
<p>Hearing my comment, Asahi-san smiled gently.</p>
<p>[I think Tennouji-san enjoys being with Tomonari-kun as well]</p>
<p>If that was the case, I’d be happy too, but…</p>
<p>No, the other party wouldn’t be limited to me. Tennouji-san always looks happy when she’s in the academy. The most important thing to remember is that you can’t just take a chance on a new person and expect both of them to be happy.</p>
<p>Why in the world would I sacrifice that?</p>
<p>Tennouji-san, are you not aware of what you’re throwing away with this arranged marriage?</p>
<p>If so, then what should I do is—</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After school that day, I was studying with Tennouji-san at the cafe next to the cafeteria.</p>
<p>[We’re getting closer to the competency test desuwa]</p>
<p>[&#8230;That’s right]</p>
<p>Since there’s no one around, I spoke to Tennouji-san in a plain manner.</p>
<p>The exams were approaching, but I didn’t see many students present after school. In the first place, the students of the academy probably have an environment where they can concentrate at home so there was no need for them to stay at the academy.</p>
<p>[For the time being, you’ve listened to the story so far, so I will explain the circumstances]</p>
<p>Putting down the mechanical pencil in her hand, Tennouji-san said.</p>
<p>[I’ve been allowed to enroll until the next proficiency exam. So, as planned, I’ll definitely beat Konohana Hinako in this exam. And… I’ll prove that I have no reason to stay here at this academy]</p>
<p>My eyes widened when I heard those words.</p>
<p>[That’s…]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Well, I did say it before]</p>
<p>When the arranged marriage is set, Tennouji-san is confirmed to be leaving the academy.</p>
<p>Yet, Tennouji-san doesn’t say anything else about it.</p>
<p>This person… She’s different from Hinako. Tennouji-san has a strong heart and is able to restrain herself, so she can’t just say [Help me].</p>
<p>[Don’t look so concerned]</p>
<p>Suddenly, Tennouji-san looked at me.</p>
<p>[Contributing to the Tennouji family is what makes me happy. Therefore, I—]</p>
<p>[―Is that really what you think?]</p>
<p>I looked straight at Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san remained silent.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Tennouji-san. Can you make time for me just for tomorrow?]</p>
<p>I continued to speak at the surprised Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[You said before, right? You’re interested in the lives of the common people]</p>
<p>[Yes. I certainly did say that]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san is an adopted child, but since she was raised in the Tennouji family, she doesn’t know the lives of ordinary people. Which is why she seemed interested in them.</p>
<p>[Would you like to take a breather before the exam? Because of all the things you did for me before, if you don’t mind, I’d like to introduce you to the commoner’s ordinary life as thanks]</p>
<p>It might be a hasty suggestion.</p>
<p>But, Tennouji-san showed that she was thinking seriously about my proposal.</p>
<p>[That’s right. Since this is a good opportunity, I’d be happy to join you]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said with a smile.</p>
<p>Since it was a good opportunity… She talked as if she was making her last memories as a student of the academy.</p>
<p>If Tennouji-san is so inclined to think so, I’ll do my best to avoid that.</p>
<p>The next day off.</p>
<p>After persuading Hinako and Shizune-san to let me go out, I waited for Tennouji-san in front of the station.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Come to think of it, it’s been a long time since I had a day off]</p>
<p>It was late afternoon. It was probably the first time since I became a caretaker that I went out purely for fun, unrelated to work. Since becoming a caretaker, I’ve spent most of my days studying, so today I feel somewhat restless, as if I have too much time on my hands.</p>
<p>And… If I think about it, today’s technically a date.</p>
<p>I’m embarrassed to say it, but I’ve never been on a date before.</p>
<p>After all this time, I’m starting to get a little nervous.</p>
<p>[Sorry to keep you waiting]</p>
<p>A voice called out to me from the side.</p>
<p>When I turned around, Tennouji-san was there but―</p>
<p>[Tennouji-san, those clothes are…?]</p>
<p>[It’s a disguise desuwa. I’m sure that you’re taking me somewhere someone like me rarely visits today, right? It’s just a way to avoid attracting attention]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san’s blonde hair, which was always curled, was straight down and she was wearing a light blue beret. She was dressed in a white blouse and blue skirt, which gave her a slightly more subdued and innocent image compared to the often conspicuous Tennouji-san at the academy.</p>
<p>It was an outfit that blended in with the city. I would say that her disguise was a brilliant success.</p>
<p>However, Tennouji-san was originally good looking. Usually Tennouji-san is beautiful, but today, I feel a different kind of charm from Tennouji-san. In any case, because of her good looks, she was still attracting the attention of the people nearby.</p>
<p>[It’s… weird, isn’t it?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san asked with a blush.</p>
<p>Oh no. I stared at her for too long.</p>
<p>[No, it’s not weird… I thought it was refreshing to see you like this]</p>
<p>[If you are referring to my hair being down, you’ve already seen it like that at my house]</p>
<p>[It’s not just your hair, but your whole atmosphere is different…]</p>
<p>I was embarrassed to say [Fresh and cute] honestly, so I slurred my words.</p>
<p>Then Tennouji-san, perhaps sensing my state of mind, gave me a smile.</p>
<p>[Which do you prefer? The me now, or the usual me?]</p>
<p>It was a very difficult question.</p>
<p>After much thought, I answered.</p>
<p>[&#8230;.If anything, I like the usual Tennouji-san more]</p>
<p>[I see. This isn’t Itsuki-san’s preference]</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4789" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00015-3-215x300.jpeg" alt="" width="471" height="657" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00015-3-215x300.jpeg 215w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00015-3-733x1024.jpeg 733w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00015-3-768x1073.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00015-3-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00015-3.jpeg 1010w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /></p>
<p>Tennouji-san put her hand to her chest and said proudly.</p>
<p>[Today I’m free to take you anywhere, right? We’re not going anywhere dangerous, but we’re going somewhere not very befitting the daughter of the Tennouji family]</p>
<p>[There’s no problem. That’s why I’m disguising myself. Even if someone sees me, I can protect the public name of the Tennouji family if they don’t find out who I really am, so I’m going to enjoy myself to the fullest today]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san made a proud face, as if to say her disguise was perfect.</p>
<p>[It’s a bit late but, I’m surprised your family allowed this. You don’t have an escort, right?]</p>
<p>[Yes. Both my father and mother are very tolerant]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said proudly.</p>
<p>[On the contrary, did Itsuki-san get permission without any problems?]</p>
<p>[Ahh. Well… It’d be a lie to say nothing happened]</p>
<p>Shizune-san was immediately convinced, as she stopped restricting my behavior as much recently.</p>
<p>The problem was Hinako. When I told her that I wanted to go out with Tennouji-san alone, she became surprisingly indignant. When I explained that I wanted to thank Tennouji-san for all the things she taught me, she somehow agreed, but then grumpily reminded me that I had to make it up to her.</p>
<p>[Anyways, Itsuki-san]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san asked in a small voice.</p>
<p>[This, um, can it be counted as a date…?]</p>
<p>[Hngh!?]</p>
<p>I had no reply.</p>
<p>Even though I was trying not to think of it, it seemed Tennouji-san had the same thing in mind.</p>
<p>[W-Well, I guess…]</p>
<p>When I affirmed it, Tennouji-san blushed slightly</p>
<p>[&#8230;This is the first time I’ve been on a date desuwa]</p>
<p>That said, Tennouji-san looked at me.</p>
<p>[That’s why… I’m looking forward to it?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said with a somewhat mean smile, but with expectation in her eyes.</p>
<p>That attitude of hers reminded me of the tough lessons I’ve been through.</p>
<p>Thinking about it calmly, I’ve always spent time alone with this person.</p>
<p>There’s no need to be overly conscious of her now.</p>
<p>[Ahh, today I’m going to teach you how to play like a commoner to the fullest]</p>
<p>I’m going to enjoy myself to the fullest today.</p>
<p>I went out to the city with Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[What is this!? What is that!? What in the world is this~!?!?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san was confused as she spun the steering wheel in circles.</p>
<p>I watched the scene with a sideways glance while slowly tilting my steering wheel to the right.</p>
<p>It had been a while since I visited an arcade, but the atmosphere was exactly as before. Miscellaneous sounds surrounded my ears, and people of all ages, from children to adults, were playing all around us.</p>
<p>What we were now playing was a popular racing game. Tennouji-san’s car, which was in the corner of the screen, went off course and hit a guardrail.</p>
<p>[Ahh!?]</p>
<p>While Tennouji-san screamed, I continued to lead the race with ease.</p>
<p>[―Alright! First place!]</p>
<p>As I reached the finish line, I took my hand off the steering wheel and looked at Tennouji-san next to me.</p>
<p>[Tennouji-san is…]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.Last place desuwa]</p>
<p>I burst out laughing when I looked at Tennouji-san, who was clearly depressed.</p>
<p>[Please don’t laugh! I was desperate, you know!?]</p>
<p>[M-My bad. But it’s a game, and it’s funny to see the bananas being thrown and hearing ‘That’s bad manners desuwa!’ afterwards… Pffttt]</p>
<p>[I told you to stop laughing!]</p>
<p>It wasn’t only me, but everyone around us was laughing as well.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san regained her composure and looked at the other games. She still looked frustrated, perhaps still feeling the sting of her defeat earlier, but she was still observing the other games with great interest.</p>
<p>It was a good decision to invite Tennouji-san to the arcade. Like Hinako, Tennouji-san was apparently not familiar with this type of entertainment.</p>
<p>Today, Tennouji-san should be able to experience the unknown.</p>
<p>[Itsuki-san, what are these taiko drums over here?]</p>
<p>[Taiko no Tatsujin, one of those rhythm games. …Let’s try this one next]<br />
(TN: Taiko no Tatsujin is a game series with rhythm gameplay using taiko as the main instrument/mechanic)</p>
<p>A rhythm game? In front of the confused Tennouji-san, I inserted a 100-yen coin.</p>
<p>I told Tennouji-san how to operate the game and immediately selected a song.</p>
<p>As soon as the game started, Tennouji-san was confused.</p>
<p>[T-This is nothing like playing instruments!!]</p>
<p>Where did her usual confidence go? Tennouji-san was moving the drumsticks in both her hands in a flustered and bewildered manner.</p>
<p>Finally, the song ended and our scores were revealed.</p>
<p>[Yosha! I win this one too] (TN: He’s just bullying her)</p>
<p>[Ughh…! If it was a real taiko, I’m sure I’d be better than you…!]</p>
<p>It was a rather unique losing complaint.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san started looking for another game to play.</p>
<p>[Itsuki-san, this is!?]</p>
<p>[Ah, air hockey. It’s kind of nostalgic]</p>
<p>[Is this… a small flying disc? Should I just throw this?]</p>
<p>[W-Wait wait! I’ll explain it to you!]</p>
<p>I stopped Tennouji-san, who was about to throw the puck, and explained the rules.</p>
<p>I didn’t really know whether she genuinely didn’t know or if she was just ignorant of games as a whole… But this unbalanced knowledge really seemed to be a common trait of a high-class lady. Hinako was also similar.</p>
<p>So I then played air hockey with Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>As a matter of course, I won.</p>
<p>[Next! Let’s go!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san looked for another game.</p>
<p>[Is that… a horse racing game?]</p>
<p>[A horse racing game huh. Do you want to try it?]</p>
<p>[We can’t! You have to be 20 years old to gamble!]</p>
<p>[It’s okay, it’s just a game]</p>
<p>I said with a laugh to Tennouji-san, who was panicking.</p>
<p>The user registration was a bit of a hassle, but I was able to join the game right away.</p>
<p>[I lost again….!]</p>
<p>[Well, this is a game of luck…]</p>
<p>It looked like Tennouji-san had bad luck today.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san tried to find another game to play… but before she did, we decided to take a break first.</p>
<p>After purchasing 2 drinks from the vending machine, we sat down on the bench near the stairs.</p>
<p>[Itsuki-san, did you play around here often?]</p>
<p>[Rather than playing around, I was working part-time here. When an acquaintance came over, I got permission from the store manager and played a little bit]</p>
<p>That’s why I didn’t lose to Tennouji-san, who was a complete beginner.</p>
<p>[A game center… was it? This is a very exciting place, isn’t it? It’s the first time I’ve visited a place with such atmosphere]</p>
<p>That was probably true, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>This place isn’t exactly flattering or safe. Tennouji-san’s parents are tolerant, but in Keigon-san’s case, he would never let Hinako in here.</p>
<p>However, there are experiences that can only be gained here.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san was charmed by the atmosphere and acted both happy and sad like an innocent child while she played.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Nn?]</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought I felt a gaze.</p>
<p>Behind the UFO catcher. On the other side of the window, someone was watching me.</p>
<p>The girl was wearing the uniform of the high school I once attended. She was staring at me with eyes that looked like she was staring at a pest, and I broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>[Ah shit]</p>
<p>Why wasn’t I watching my surroundings?</p>
<p>This was the area I used to live in. So naturally, there was a good chance I would run into someone I knew.</p>
<p>The last time I spoke to this girl… My childhood friend, Yuri, was the first day I was appointed as Hinako’s caretaker. In other words, it’s more than a month ago. It wasn’t a verbal conversation, just an exchange of messages on our phones. I haven’t been in touch with her since…. but it seems like I found myself in quite a predicament.</p>
<p>However, after Yuri looked back and forth at me and Tennouji-san, she silently turned her back.</p>
<p>[What’s wrong?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.No, it’s nothing]</p>
<p>Contrary to my expectations, Yuri left quietly.</p>
<p>It was a little worrisome, but I had to pay attention to Tennouji-san for the time being.</p>
<p>[Then, next let’s go bowling. No… is karaoke more common?]</p>
<p>For me, Hinako’s caretaker, today’s expenses are insignificant.</p>
<p>Next, it would be appropriate to go bowling or to go to karaoke. Anyway, I would like to provide Tennouji-san with an unusual experience. (TN: how about a hotel?) (EDN: Bonk)</p>
<p>Thinking like that, I thought to myself.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Let’s go to all of them]</p>
<p>With a voice that seemed to have been squeezed out, Tennouji-san announced.</p>
<p>[We’re going to all of them! I’m not letting you go until I win!]</p>
<p>Perhaps I lit Tennouji-san’s fighting spirit too much.</p>
<p>However, my hope came true, so I nodded and agreed with Tennouji-san.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, the sky was already dark.</p>
<p>The sun had already set, and it was almost 7 pm.</p>
<p>As I leisurely headed for the station, I lightly stretched my body.</p>
<p>[It’s been a while since I played this much…]</p>
<p>Muttering almost unconsciously, I looked at Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[Tennouji-san. What did you think of today?]</p>
<p>[It was the worstttttt!!!!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san yelled loudly.</p>
<p>[In the end, I never won a game, and I was a wreck at bowling!]</p>
<p>[But karaoke was a good competition, wasn’t it?]</p>
<p>[I won’t be satisfied with high scores on nursery rhymes!]</p>
<p>Since I had won at the game center and bowling convincingly, I thought I would be able to handle karaoke, but that wasn’t the case. It seems that Tennouji-san had undergone voice training, and her singing ability was remarkable.</p>
<p>However, her singing repertoire was limited. She seemed to be familiar with classical music, but she didn’t know any of the popular bands that people usually listen to. So, in the end, Tennouji-san had no choice but to sing a children’s song that everyone knew. The humiliated look on Tennouji-san’s face that moment was clearly etched in my memory.</p>
<p>[It seemed like Tennouji-san likes competitions, so I tried to plan it towards that today… but I’m glad you enjoyed it]</p>
<p>[Yeah… Thanks to you, I felt my blood boiling for the first time in a while]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san was so frustrated that she clenched her fist tightly.</p>
<p>[What’re we going to do now? Are we going somewhere else?]</p>
<p>[I would love to do that but… as expected, it’s already late today]</p>
<p>[&#8230;That’s right]</p>
<p>I agreed with Tennouji-san as she looked up at the darkened sky.</p>
<p>[Well then, let’s leave it here for today]</p>
<p>Hearing my casual words, Tennouji-san reacted with a twitch.</p>
<p>[&#8230;You say mean words, you know?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san stopped and stared at her feet.</p>
<p>After all, Tennouji-san seemed to think of today as the last time to make memories before leaving the academy.</p>
<p>However, whether today is the last day or not will depend on Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[If you refuse the arranged marriage, we can always continue where we left off]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.Even if you say that, my stance won’t change]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>[We had a very enjoyable time together today. However, if you ask me if it was for the good of the Tennouji family―]</p>
<p>[Can’t it just be for fun?]</p>
<p>I interrupted Tennouji-san and asked.</p>
<p>[Isn’t that enough reason to turn down the marriage offer?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san opened her eyes in confusion, as if she didn’t expect to be told such a thing.</p>
<p>[That’s…. not possible. Today’s event was about me personally. On the other hand, the arranged marriage is about the situation of the Tennouji family. The scale is too different]</p>
<p>The passers-by looked at us as we suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>I then ask Tennouji-san clearly, while she was biting her lips.</p>
<p>[Then, Tennouji-san―Are you willing to throw away everything for the Tennouji family?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san kept her mouth shut.</p>
<p>[I can’t imagine how much pressure Tennouji-san is under. But after actually meeting Tennouji-san’s parents, I’m convinced… They must be wishing for Tennouji-san’s happiness. They care about Tennouji Mirei, not just the Tennouji family]</p>
<p>When I visited Tennouji-san’s house, I was asked by her mother, Hanami-san, [Is Mirei having a good time at the academy?]</p>
<p>From the beginning, she had no interest in Tennouji-san’s public appearance. As long as her daughter was having a good time at the academy, it’d be fine… That’s what she thought.</p>
<p>[That’s… just your imagination desuwa]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said with her face down.</p>
<p>[Father and mother are both very kind, so they don’t force me to do anything. However, I’m sure that they really want me to live for the family―]</p>
<p>[―That’s not true!!]</p>
<p>I just couldn’t listen to her words any longer.</p>
<p>Right now, I am a little pissed.</p>
<p>How could this person not notice..?</p>
<p>[Dyeing your hair gold! Speaking in a strange tone! Do you really think that’s for the good of the Tennouji family!?]</p>
<p>[Wha!? H-H-Hey…!?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san’s face flushed red as if to say “I’m not talking about that here!”.</p>
<p>When she was a child, Tennouji-san truly believed that doing so would be for the good of the family. Now that she had grown up, she was still sticking to that belief by her own will.</p>
<p>[But Masatsugu-san and Hanami-san didn’t complain about anything, did they!?]</p>
<p>[―!?]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san gasped. I may have let my emotions run wild. Yet I had no intention of withdrawing my statement.</p>
<p>The situation with Hinako was different.</p>
<p>Hinko was suffering under unreasonable pressure from the Konohana family and Keigon-san’s decision. However, in Tennouji-san&#8217;s case, there is nothing unreasonable. Tennouji-san is just trapped in her own conviction.</p>
<p>I just couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>[Those people… are prioritizing Tennouji-san over the family]</p>
<p>I will tell her again the facts that I see as an outsider.</p>
<p>[Is Tennouji-san properly facing those thoughts?]</p>
<p>Unlike me, Tennouji-san can still talk to her parents properly.</p>
<p>Hiding this thought in my heart, I told her.</p>
<p>The serious eyes of the boy standing in front of her pierced her heart strongly.</p>
<p>Tennouji Mirei recalled an incident from her childhood in response to Itsuki’s words.</p>
<p>[We want to make Mirei happy, okay?]</p>
<p>That’s what her parents said several times to Mirei, who was taken in as her adopted child. They declared that they would treat Mirei as their own child. However, they never wanted to tie Mirei down. This was something that has been conveyed to her since she was a child.</p>
<p>That was why Mirei always wanted to repay her kind hearted father and mother.</p>
<p>After learning about the fame of the Tennouji family―The family that took her in, Mirei realized how to repay their kindness.</p>
<p>[Mother. If I study hard, will it benefit the Tennouji family?]</p>
<p>When she was a little girl. Mirei asked her mother.</p>
<p>Her mother happily replied [Yes].</p>
<p>[Father. If I become famous, would it benefit the Tennouji family?]</p>
<p>When she was a little girl. Mirei asked her father.</p>
<p>Her father answered [Yes] with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>Since then, Mirei studied hard, dyed her hair, changed her tone of voice, and began her life as the daughter of the Tennouji family. At first, she made many mistakes. Originally, her test scores were average, and she wasn’t particularly popular. Nevertheless, as a result of her desperate efforts, Mirei became famous as an outstanding student. Mirei made such a bloody effort that her past self disappeared in a haze.</p>
<p>[Mirei. I know you’re always studying late at night, but… You could live more freely, you know?]</p>
<p>One day. Her mother told her so.</p>
<p>[Please don’t worry. This is the path I chose for myself]</p>
<p>Mirei answered with a smile. Then her mother agreed with a [I see], but her face was anxious.</p>
<p>She may indeed be trying a little too hard. But she’s sure they’ll eventually understand. She just wants to repay her parents for taking her in.</p>
<p>[Mirei. It’s all well and good to have good manners, but it’s okay to cut loose once in a while, okay?]</p>
<p>[No problem. As the daughter of the Tennouji family, I’ll do at least this much]</p>
<p>How long has it been like this?</p>
<p>She noticed that she shook her head without a moment’s hesitation at her parents’ questions.</p>
<p>(Ahh… I see)</p>
<p>The words of Itsuki,the boy in front of her, ruminated in her brain.</p>
<p>[Is Tennouji-san properly facing those thoughts?]―Those words shook Mirei’s core values.</p>
<p>(I was… running away desuwa)</p>
<p>She didn’t have the confidence to be their daughter.</p>
<p>She chose to become the daughter of the Tennouji family in her own way.</p>
<p>Because it was easier to understand. It was much easier to get a good score on a test and act with the class than it was to respond to one’s parents’ wishes.</p>
<p>The boy in front of her made her realize…She’d been running away from such feelings.</p>
<p>[Why…]</p>
<p>Unintentionally, such words spilled from her lips.</p>
<p>[Why… is Itsuki-san so willing to help me this much…?]</p>
<p>How could this person be so sincere with her, even though he wasn’t part of her family?</p>
<p>To Mirei’s question, Itsuki answered with a serious expression.</p>
<p>[Because… I too, want Tennouji-san to live as happily as possible]</p>
<p>Itsuki spoke boldly, without feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>[If… you think today’s experience is valuable… please don’t throw it away]</p>
<p>Today… she thought back to what she went through.</p>
<p>Game centers, bowling, and karaoke… All may be unnecessary experiences for the daughter of the Tennouji family. But for Tennouji Mirei, that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Today, she was able to truly enjoy herself.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Swindler]</p>
<p>Mirei muttered in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just her parents.</p>
<p>Not for the daughter of the Tennouji family… but for someone named Tennouji Mirei, there was someone… Someone who thought of her dearly.</p>
<p>That’s why, she realized.</p>
<p>[Swindler, scammer, con man… You’re really good with your words, aren’t you…]</p>
<p>She struggled to hold back tears that formed in the corner of her eyes, trying not to let any through.</p>
<p>Her emotions were a jumbled mess. She was certain that right now, her actions were unbecoming of the daughter of the Tennouji family.</p>
<p>But, it was okay.</p>
<p>Right now, she doesn’t see herself that way.</p>
<p>[&#8230;I’ve been coaxed by you]</p>
<p>Wiping tears from her eyes, Mirei laughed.</p>
<p>[I’ll refuse the offer. …I can’t give up something as valuable as this]</p>
<p>[&#8230;I see]</p>
<p>Itsuki was visibly relieved.</p>
<p>Just the sight of that alone might be worth turning down the marriage offer.</p>
<p>[Well, to be honest, if you asked me whether today was precious, I wouldn’t―]</p>
<p>[No, that’s not what I meant]</p>
<p>She didn’t just say that today was valuable.</p>
<p>Honestly… She couldn’t tell whether he was sharp or dull.</p>
<p>[You are precious] (TN: ALL HAIL BEST GIRL)</p>
