<h3>Epilogue - The Troubles of a Young Lady (Ojou-sama)</h3>

<p>After Tennouji-san turned down her arranged marriage, the next competency exam was soon held.</p>
<p>Unlike the regular exams, the competency exams were not composed of many subjects. However the number of questions was still very large, even for such a prestigious school, and the exam was held over the period of 3 days.</p>
<p>One week passed after that.</p>
<p>Then, the results of the exam were announced.</p>
<p>[Everyone~! Over here~!]</p>
<p>Many students had already gathered at the bulletin board in front of the staff room.</p>
<p>After putting my bag in the classroom, I headed to the bulletin board with Hinako, and Asahi-san beckoned to us in the distance.</p>
<p>Next to her was Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[I met with Tennouji-san just now!]</p>
<p>Asahi-san said, and Tennouji-san bowed silently.</p>
<p>Then she turned her gaze to my face.</p>
<p>[Let’s see how it turned out together]</p>
<p>If I wasn&#8217;t being self-indulgent, the line was directed at me personally, and not anyone else.</p>
<p>Tension built up in my stomach and I gulped.</p>
<p>After an examination is being held, the scores and names of the top 50 are announced. My goal was to be among the top 50.</p>
<p>I looked at the board with that resolve.</p>
<p>There, my name was―</p>
<p>[&#8230;It’s not on it]</p>
<p>My body was on the verge of collapsing to my knees, but I barely held myself together.</p>
<p>I failed to achieve my goal.</p>
<p>[It’s not a surprise desuwa]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said next to the depressed me.</p>
<p>[All the students here have been educated from a young age to be gifted. If you want to catch up to them, you need to continue to work hard for many years]</p>
<p>That may indeed be true.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to make a difference.</p>
<p>I couldn’t give a good result even though I had learned from Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san let out a sigh as I remained silent.</p>
<p>[&#8230;You, have you graded yourself?]</p>
<p>[Eh? No, I haven’t….]</p>
<p>[I think your score is very close, based on what I’ve seen so far. At least, if we only look at the changes in score, you’ve improved by a long shot]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san looked at me with admiration.</p>
<p>[If you’re still not satisfied… Then you should just keep trying in the future desuwa]</p>
<p>That one sentence made my depressed feelings go away.</p>
<p>Seeing Tennouji-san with a smile on her face, the heaviness in my heart quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>[&#8230;That’s right]</p>
<p>That’s right. I just have to keep trying.</p>
<p>Because Tennouji-san isn’t leaving the academy…</p>
<p>I can leave this frustration to the future.</p>
<p>[Unnn~, I don’t see mine either. Well, I expected it]</p>
<p>[I’m not there either, like I should be]</p>
<p>[Yes. Mine isn’t either]</p>
<p>Asahi-san, Taisho, and Narika seemed to have given up from the beginning.</p>
<p>The remaining two were… Hinako and Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[Konohana-san and Tennouji-san seem to be in the single digits. Hmm…. but the crowds are so big, we might not be able to see them from here]</p>
<p>Asahi-san stood on her tiptoes and tried to peer across the crowd towards the bulletin.</p>
<p>The names of the top 10 were apparently announced in a big way on another bulletin board. An even larger crowd gathered in front of it.</p>
<p>[Hey, that’s awesome! It looks like a perfect score!]</p>
<p>Taisho said excitedly as he heard the students around us talking.</p>
<p>[Is a perfect score that rare?]</p>
<p>[Of course! The exams at the academy are really difficult. It’s extremely rare to get a perfect score]</p>
<p>It was true that the questions were quite difficult.</p>
<p>For a moment, I silently looked at Hinako and Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>If there was a student who got a perfect score, it’d be one of these two…</p>
<p>[This time, I and Konohana Hinako…]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san let out a small mumble that almost no one could hear. …But I was the only one who heard it. I was the only one who knew what Tennouji-san was prepared to do.</p>
<p>Feeling a slight tension, the students in the crowd noticed Hinako and Tennouji-san’s presence and gave way. The noisy crowd scattered left and right like how Moses split the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The two Ojou-samas of the academy stood in front of the bulletin board in a leisurely manner.</p>
<p>When they saw the result of the test… Their eyes widened.</p>
<p>[This is&#8230;]</p>
<p>[A perfect score, both…?]</p>
<p>At the top of the list was Hinako’s name. Below that was Tennouji-san’s.</p>
<p>However, both of their scores were exactly the same―800 points.</p>
<p>The students clapped for Hinako and Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>I secretly called out to Hinako in the middle of the applause.</p>
<p>[Hinako also gave it her best, right?]</p>
<p>[&#8230;Nn]</p>
<p>In a plain tone of voice, Hinako affirmed.</p>
<p>[To the two of you… I won’t lose]</p>
<p>Hinako said somewhat teasingly.</p>
<p>Ahh… that’s right.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but laugh. It was natural when I thought about it.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san wasn’t the only one who worked as hard as she could for this exam.</p>
<p>Hinako, too, was doing her best.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Fufu]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san let out a laugh.</p>
<p>She couldn’t achieve her goal of beating Hinako. But Tennouji-san was―</p>
<p>[Ohohoho! This is why you’re my rival desuwa!!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san laughed in a good mood.</p>
<p>It was as if she was happy to continue being Hinako’s rival.</p>
<p>[I have a proposal for my rival]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san blushed slightly and looked nervously at Hinako.</p>
<p>[T-Tonight… would you like to visit my house?]</p>
<p>That night.</p>
<p>I visited the Tennouji family again.</p>
<p>[Then, we’ll be going our separate ways from here]</p>
<p>Shizune-san got out of the passenger seat and bowed her head towards me and Hinako.</p>
<p>[What are you going to do, Shizune-san?]</p>
<p>[I will go with Keigon-sama to greet the representative of the Tennouji family first. Itsuki-sama, please go with ojou-sama to greet them later]</p>
<p>[Understood]</p>
<p>Behind Shizune-san, Keigon-san was straightening his tie.</p>
<p>While Hinako and I were talking with Tennouji-san, Keigon-san and Shizune-san seemed to be going to greet Masatsugu-san and Hanami-san, the representatives of the Tennouji family.</p>
<p>[Itsuki… that suit, is that new…?]</p>
<p>Suddenly, Hinako asked me in a small voice.</p>
<p>[Yeah. I heard today’s dinner was French, so I decided to match my suit with a French one]</p>
<p>This is because before leaving the mansion, Shizune-san asked [Which suit will you be wearing?] so I thought a little about coordinating in my own way. I had worn an Italian suit at the Konohana social event before, so I wanted to change the mood.</p>
<p>Hearing this exchange between me and Hinako, Keigon-san who was standing beside me, muttered quietly.</p>
<p>[It’s refined]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe what he said, so I asked.</p>
<p>[&#8230;Did you just compliment me?]</p>
<p>[I was praising the Tennoji family&#8217;s human resource development techniques, not you]</p>
<p>With that, Keigon-san turned his back on us and walked away with Shizune-san.</p>
<p>I wasn’t so naive to take that at face value. When I realized that Keigon-san recognized me, a sense of accomplishment slowly crept to my heart.</p>
<p>It was all thanks to the time I spent with Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>With Hinako, I stepped into the Tennouji family mansion.</p>
<p>[I was waiting for you! Konohana-san, Tomonari-san!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san welcomed us with a full smile.</p>
<p>She looked like a girl who was waiting for a friend, rather than someone of elegance.</p>
<p>[Thank you for your invitation today]</p>
<p>[Hinako, who switched modes, greeted her carefully.</p>
<p>[I’ve visited several times before, but this is the first time I’ve come over for a private affair. Was there any reason why?]</p>
<p>[There is no particular reason]</p>
<p>After that, Tennouji-san smiled softly.</p>
<p>[But, if you ask me… I just wanted to get along with you, not as a daughter of the Tennouji family, but as a normal classmate]</p>
<p>Hinako looked slightly surprised. The fact that Hinako, who was playing the role of Ojou-sama, was about to lose her expression showed how unexpected Tennouji-san’s remarks were.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san has changed.</p>
<p>Now Tennouji-san has accepted two realities: that she’s the daughter of the Tennouji family, and that she’s a girl.</p>
<p>[&#8230;I too, want to get along with Tennouji-san]</p>
<p>Hinako, who hid her surprise, smiled, and Tennouji-san’s cheeks were dyed red.</p>
<p>[W-Well, it’s kind of embarrassing to say…]</p>
<p>I was watching them from a step away as the atmosphere became somewhat awkward.</p>
<p>Then, without thinking, I turned my gaze elsewhere―</p>
<p>[Uuuu….! Mirei is…Our Mirei is growing…!!!]</p>
<p>[That&#8217;s right dear….! Somehow, our daughter looks even more radiant than usual…!]</p>
<p>The two parental figures were shedding tears at the sight of Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>[Tomonari-kun. …No, Itsuki-kun]</p>
<p>Masatsugu-san, who wiped his tears with a handkerchief, approached me.</p>
<p>For some reason, Masatsugu-san adjusted the way he called me.</p>
<p>[I’ve heard about you from Mirei. It seems you brought out our girl’s true feelings]</p>
<p>[No…]</p>
<p>[Mirei has such good friends. ….I see. Surely it would be a shame to leave the academy]</p>
<p>Masatsugu-san said, looking at me and Hinako.</p>
<p>Looking at that calm face. I felt it again. After all, Masatsugu-san was thinking about her daughter, Mirei, rather than their family’s prestige.</p>
<p>[By the way, Itsuki-kun. Are you interested in the Tennouji Group?]</p>
<p>[Excuse me?]</p>
<p>I tilted my head at the sudden question.</p>
<p>[I guess I was too indirect. So I’ll ask you again… Are you interested in becoming my son-in-law?]</p>
<p>[Ha? Eh… What?]</p>
<p>[It seems that Mirei wants to marry out of love. I’m sure you’re the closest man to my daughter at the moment, right? First, you have to―]</p>
<p>[―Father!!]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san’s shout resounded through the area.</p>
<p>I guess she was listening to us. Tennouji-san approached with a bright crimson face.</p>
<p>[Please don’t talk without permission!]</p>
<p>[W-well, but. If Itsuki-kun becomes our son-in-law in the future, he needs to know about the work of the Tennouji group from now―]</p>
<p>[We still have a lot of time!!]</p>
<p>Perhaps because Tennouji-san is now more aware of her position in her family, Masatsugu-san’s parental feelings have run rampant as well.</p>
<p>Masatsugu-san’s shoulders slumped and he fell silent.</p>
<p>[Honestly… I’m sorry for that, Tomonari-san]</p>
<p>[No, I don’t really mind it…]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san apologized awkwardly, and I chuckled.</p>
<p>[Even if it was a joke, I was surprised]</p>
<p>When I said that, Tennouji-san made a somewhat boorish face.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san turned away and looked somewhat sulky.</p>
<p>[&#8230;It’s not necessarily a joke]</p>
<p>[Eh?]</p>
<p>[I’m not sure if there’s anyone I’m more in sync with than you, at least right now. Perhaps you’ll be approached by the Tennouji family with an offer of marriage]</p>
<p>[&#8230;.No, but… I’m not really the heir to any company…]</p>
<p>I told her quietly so that the others wouldn’t hear.</p>
<p>Then Tennouji-san smiled confidently.</p>
<p>[Ara. Do you think my parents care about such a title?]</p>
<p>They wouldn’t, I guess….</p>
<p>And because they didn’t care, Tennouji-san was freed from her arranged marriage.</p>
<p>[If you were offered an arranged marriage with me, what would you do?]</p>
<p>[Well, I don’t know how to say it… but I’d have to hear Tennouji-san’s intentions first…]</p>
<p>[Then, if I’m willing to, you’ll accept?]</p>
<p>[That would be…]</p>
<p>I was at a loss because I couldn’t visualize the future at all as told by Tennouji-san.</p>
<p>When I was like this, Tennouji-san gave a sly smile.</p>
<p>[I’m just kidding. I shouldn’t do this to a swindler]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san said happily.</p>
<p>[But, if such a time comes then―]</p>
<p>Tennouji-san looked as confident as ever.</p>
<p>Tennouji-san gently touched my lips with her finger.</p>
<p>[―I will surely let you choose me]</p>
