<h3>Chapter 3: The Troubles of a Young Lady (Ojou-sama)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning. I woke up at the usual time and quickly changed into my academy uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After lightly completing my duties as a servant, I was about to go to my room to get my bag for the academy when I saw Hinako walking towards me from across the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a corridor that led to the dining room through a straight path. Shizune-san must’ve guided her here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuwaaa~.. Itsuki, good morning…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh, good morning. Are you going to have breakfast?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako nodded sleepily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I wish we could also have breakfast together]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The servants have to do their job in the morning. I can’t help it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Even though you didn’t wake me up…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There are other things, you know. Cleaning, laundry, and so on. Shizune-san must be busy too, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako gave a [Hmmm] as if she’s convinced of my reasoning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suddenly gave my doubts to Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, I was wondering… why did you say I no longer needed to wake you up all of a sudden?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eughhh…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let out a strange voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like she&#8217;d been hit where it hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-about that…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And then, you used to say [Piggyback] or [Hug] a lot, but you haven’t been doing that lately…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I was a little depressed at first. I wondered if I did something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hinako seemed to still trust me after that. That’s why I’m curious. What caused her to change recently?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-well, I… decided that… I wanted to graduate from those…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is there any reason for doing that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There is, but… I’m not sure either…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who sounded distressed, eventually told me slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If-if Itsuki wants me to do it… I’ll do it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t expect that answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know how to feel about that… Honestly, it’s not all that bad. But, after all, it’s not something that should be done leisurely. Excessive skinship is dangerous in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not that I don’t want you to, but… If Hinako continues to be like this, I’m afraid there may not be any point in having a caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[—!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this with a wry smile, Hinako suddenly looked pale, as if she witnessed a tragedy. Well, in actuality, Hinako still gets lost even in the mansion, tries to sleep whenever she gets the chance, and there’s still a lot of work for the caretakers to do… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako wrinkled her brow and her mouth opened and closed multiple times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Hinako looked as if she made up her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hug]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huggg…!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a long time since she asked me to do so, but unlike before, her tone wasn’t asking for my confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puzzled by the change in Hinako, I tried to hold her with both hands. When we’re close enough for our skin to touch, Hinako turned her body sideways and put her hands around my neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she wanted to be carried like a princess. I was a little embarrassed but… I was also happy that she asked for it after a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hold Hinako slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s face, visible against my chest, was bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Are you okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m okay, that’s why… just keep going and take me to the dining room…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako buried her face in my chest, as if she didn’t want me to see her reddened face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that still didn’t hide the bright red ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m… going to continue to do this, because I want Itsuki to take care of me…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said as she gripped my collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t prevent my mouth from dropping open at the sight of the current  Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You know, I don’t have any intention to quit being Hinako’s caretaker either]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako responded shyly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, things are different from before. But, she doesn’t seem to hate me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s kind of like, she’s starting to be aware of me as the opposite sex― (TN: HE AIN’T DENSE?!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.No, that’s impossible] (TN: 1 line too soon me, 1 line too soon…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I muttered in a voice so small even Hinako couldn’t hear me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako just sees me as someone like a trusted family member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or so I convinced myself… as I walked Hinako to the dining room.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday, after class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While studying like I usually do in the cafe next to the cafeteria, I noticed that Tennouji-san’s pen stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh? …A-ahhh, excuse me. I was lost in my thoughts]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san seemed distracted, which is quite unusual for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t just now either. From a while ago, I had a feeling that Tennouji-san was focusing on something else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is something wrong? You seem a little out of sorts today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, don’t worry about it. I’m feeling fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Tennouji-san graded the answer sheet I had with a red pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I finished grading the quiz. You got a score of 98… Seems like you were too enthusiastic about the application questions, you forgot about the basic questions]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After grading my math quiz, Tennouji-san immediately explained my mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I silently took notes on Tennouji-san’s explanation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Next, we will practice table manners. …Let’s take a break before that. I will go to the restroom first]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san got up and headed towards the academy building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched her as she left and tilted my head again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230; As I thought, Tennouji-san doesn’t seem very energetic today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said it was nothing, but I was sure that was a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her complexion wasn’t bad, and there was nothing wrong with how she walked. So it might not be a physical thing, but something was weighing on her mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I feel like it’d be rude to go to  pry if it’s something she wanted to keep it a secret. I would like to help, but only to the extent that I don’t become a pushover of kindness…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking about this, a familiar figure crossed my path in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to the girl with her black hair dangling down to her thighs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Narika?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mm?&#8230; Itsuki! You’re Itsuki, aren’t you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika noticed my presence and approached me with a twinkle in her eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never thought she would be so happy to hear me just by calling out to her… She’s like a friendly dog. I can see an imaginary tail wagging on Narika’s back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did you call for me, Itsuki!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I didn’t really call you, I just saw you walking… What are you doing staying at the academy this late?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What, it’s no big deal. I was asking whether the product we’re developing could be used at the academy. My family makes sporting goods and the academy is one of our customers]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika’s family, the Miyakojima, run a sporting goods manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps they were selling equipment to use in PE classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;So you’ve been doing that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’m still the daughter of the Miyakojima family. You can praise me all you want]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s great, very great]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Isn’t that a bit of a throwback?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, Narika looks happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, what are you doing, Itsuki?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was studying with Tennouji-san. We’re preparing for the competency test, and we’re about to practice table manners]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mm, I didn’t know about that. Both Itsuki and Tennouji-san are so serious to continue studying even after the midterm exams are over]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s how it is. …But you know, our grades aren’t that far from each other, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Right, I should probably study up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell the truth, Narika’s grades are lower than mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has near perfect marks in PE and history, but in every other subject, she avoided red marks, but she must’ve been below average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we lost the point of the conversation, we both went silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Narika was nervous. Maybe she still has some business to attend to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry I stopped you. I’ll see you later]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha- wait! That wasn’t an invitation for me to join the study group too!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(insert Dog Naruka)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No… I mean, you didn’t say anything]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought you’d figure it out!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you said that…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-or what? …As I thought, I’m still a difficult person to ask out, aren’t I…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I didn’t say that, but…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s okay, you don’t have to worry about it…. I heard some of my classmates talking about it the other day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.That, must’ve been hard]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. ….It was very, very painful] (TN: I relate) (EDN: Mood)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika looked like she was going to cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear God. Can’t you let Narika live an easier life, even if just a little…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’ve already finished today’s study, but I’m going to have Tennouji-san look over my etiquette now. If you don’t mind, why don’t you join us, Narika?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-is that okay? E-even if someone like me participates…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[At least I don’t find it hard to ask you out, and I’m sure Tennouji-san would be fine with Narika]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Itsuki..! After all, Itsuki’s the only person on my side…!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d like to see you actively making connections other than me if possible… but I guess that’s just wishful thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For today, though, I’m grateful that Narika is participating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was still concerned about Tennouji-san’s situation. If Tennouji-san was suffering from a problem that I couldn’t solve, she might be able to tell me what was going on if Narika joined us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, Miyakojima-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san returned from the restroom, and noticed Narika’s presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san. Is it okay if Narika participates in the etiquette practice we’re about to do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s fine, but…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked at Narika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika opened her mouth in panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[J-just for today! I’ve been too busy these days with work at home… but, um, you know, I want to spend some time as a student… once in a while…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, she’s lonely and wants to have friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san nodded with a gentle smile, as if she somehow grasped Narika’s personality after the previous sessions and tea party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t mind. Let’s have a light dinner today, shall we?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika’s expression brightened in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered what kind of life Narika had before she met me again… I was curious, but afraid to ask, so I sealed that question in the back of my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[E-Eh!? I-Itsuki… stayed at Tennouji-san’s house!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While enjoying a light meal at the cafe, I explained to Narika what had happened so far, and she was wide-eyed and surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, it just happened]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-That’s not just something that can be dealt just by chance, you know…! W-well, I’ve been thinking for a while now, but what did you do to get along with big names like Konohana-san and Tennouji-san…!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika, the daughter of the Miyakojima family, is supposed to be included in that big group, but she still feels that Hinako and Tennouji-san are in a different class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When Tomonari-san stayed at my house, my father checked his etiquette, and said he got a passing grade. Therefore, I will conclude the etiquette practice today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I agree with Tennouji-san’s plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s practice session was like a final confirmation. If I make a mistake here, I’ll have to relearn my etiquette again… but maybe because I had dinner with Masatsugu-san at Tennouji-san’s house, I feel that I have the courage to shrug off a little nervousness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While eating, I looked at Narika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although not as attentive as Tennouji-san, Narika was also attentive to the way she eats. She used her knife and fork lightly and did not make any unnecessary noise when drinking her soup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Narika, you… have proper manners]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-You!? Are you making fun of me!? As I told you earlier, I’m still the daughter of the Miyakojima family!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika’s face turned bright red and she became angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pffft]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Tennouji-san broke into a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. …You two seemed to be having too much fun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san wipes tears from the corners of her eyes with her fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe now was a good time to ask. ―So I looked at Tennouji-san and expressed my concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, Tennouji-san. Can I ask what’s bothering you today? …I owe Tennouji-san a lot of things, and if it’s okay with you, I can give you as much advice as you need]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked this, Tennouji-san’s expression clearly darkened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But eventually, as if gathering her determination, she looked up and began to speak. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually, I’ve been asked about a arranged marriage]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika and I looked at each other, over one particular word she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grew up as a commoner, so I’m not too familiar with this kind of talk. However, through Hinako and the Konohana family’s situation, I think I understand some of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An arranged marriage isn’t necessarily bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, judging from Tennouji-san’s lack of usual confidence…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Does that mean Tennouji-san isn’t too on board with the matchmaking…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that’s not what I meant]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to my expectations, Tennouji-san denied it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I am the daughter of the Tennouji family, so I was prepared from an early age for marriage offers. However, it was a bit sudden, so I’m surprised… or rather, I don’t know how to feel, and I’m currently confused]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was really unusual for Tennouji-san to act this way, and she seemed bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well… for us, it’s not an exaggeration to say it’s a fateful decision]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika says with a complicated expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Has Narika ever been approached for an arranged marriage too?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I’ve never had one. I heard that it’ll happen eventually but… Ah!? Well, wait! Don’t get me wrong! I’d rather have a marriage out of love, and…. Anyways, I don’t accept any arranged marriages!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-yeah…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Narika was staring at me and speaking energetically, and though I was puzzled, I agreed with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And in my case, my parents weren’t too keen on the idea of arranged marriage. There was a time when it became a topic, but both my father and mother said “It’s too early for you”]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… your parents are looking out of you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What the hell do you mean!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked away from Narika who seemed to be saying “You’re out of your mind!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I imagined Narika’s arranged marriage. …She remains completely silent and stands as stiff as a Jizo statue. (TN:Kasa Jizō is a Japanese folk tale about an old couple whose generosity is rewarded by Jizō, the Japanese name for the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha/// Or it&#8217;s a battle cat, I really don&#8217;t know) (EDN: You can think of him as a Buddist God of Earth)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san… what do you think about my arranged marriage?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san asked, looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought for a moment and then answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In my house, we’ve never talked about arranged marriage… So to be honest, I don’t really know. But if it’s good for Tennouji-san, I will support it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I meant every word I said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I owe a debt of gratitude to Tennouji-san. So I want to help her as much as I can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you, the both of you. …Thanks to you, I feel like I can see clearly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san raises her eyes and says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I think about it calmly, accepting an offer of marriage will not change my existing relationships. …I might have been more defensive than I needed to]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook my head at Tennouji-san’s words, who had regained her energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I also enjoy spending time with Tennouji-san this way, so even if an arranged marriage was decided, I hope this relationship would continue]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[M-Me too!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narika agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, after dinner with Tennouji-san, who was back to her old self, we parted ways.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After parting with Itsuki and the others, Mirei got into the Tennouji family car parked in front of the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work, Mirei ojou-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servant opened the back seat door and Mirei got in the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the car started to drive away, Mirei was looking out at the changing scenery, remembering the conversation she just had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Seriously… you’re such a dense person)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a small sigh without anyone noticing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(If the arranged marriage goes through, we won’t be able to spend time after-school together anymore, like we do now…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once women have a fiance, they’re hesitant to meet with men other than their fiance more than necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chances of spending the same time together in private, let alone at an academy event, will inevitably decrease. At least, they won’t see each other every day as they’ve been doing recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(But… Tomonari-san is also more indifferent than I thought he would be… He could have said something more…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it’s something good for Tennouji-san, I will support it”. Such words from Itsuki sounded sincere but… also somewhat strangerly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Also, you just said to me the other day…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Itsuki said it might be fun to work together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t that mean―don’t you want to be with me even after you graduate from the academy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thinking about it, Mirei suddenly noticed an uncomfortable feeling in her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s weird, desuwa] (TN: THE RETURN!!) (EDN: OJOU-SAMA!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had decided that she would live for the Tennouji family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought it would be the greatest happiness for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What is this, this feeling…?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t believe at all that she would be happy at the end of this marriage.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks have passed since I started spending time with Tennouji-san after-school</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study sessions were scheduled to continue until the next competency exam, so today was the turnaround point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We’re also starting dance lessons today!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than two weeks remained until the final exam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san and I were facing each other in the gymnasium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. You had to go all the way to rent the gymnasium for this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not a big deal]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thanked Tennouji-san, who was wearing the academy’s designated sportswear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We finished practicing proper etiquette, and today, we started practicing ballroom dancing. I’ve received some simple instructions from Shizune-san in the past, but I’m far less knowledgeable and experienced in this area than I am in etiquette. Put it simply, I lack confidence in this area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, shall we begin with a slow waltz?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, Tennouji-san began to play music from a speaker in the corner of the gymnasium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A waltz tune started playing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come on, what are you just standing there for? Come quickly to my side]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[R-Right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballroom dancing is performed by men and women facing each other while in close contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all this time, I’m still conscious of the distance and my body movements become awkward because of the fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come closer]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[C-closer, is it..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distance between me and Tennouji-san was already less than 50 cm, but I took another half step closer. Then, Tennouji-san also took half step closer. Our bodies were basically touching, and I could feel her soft touch and sweet scent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[With your left hand, take my right hand. Then shift your body about half a body length…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desperately suppressing my embarrassment, I adjusted my position in accordance with Tennouji-san’s instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put my right hand on Tennouji-san’s shoulder blade, and she put her left hand on my other arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the basic posture called the hold. …You’ll dance slowly while maintaining this posture]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, but I still don’t really know how to dance…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There is a saying “It’s better to learn by doing”. I will lead the way, and you follow carefully]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san quickly retracted her right leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if caught in the movement, I stepped in with her left foot. Slowly, she moved counterclockwise around the gym, repeating a similar exchange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here’s a half turn to the right… Okay, keep going, half turn again…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was busy trying to not release the tightness of my body, before I knew it, I found myself dancing as if I was being drawn in by Tennouji-san’s movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the loop of the song was over, I stopped dancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How was it? You can dance better than you think, can’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought so too. …Somehow, I think I kind of got the whole thing figured out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san is also adapting very quickly, even though I was leading the way. …Are you maybe athletic?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I’m inherently better at physical things than etiquette and studying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not bad at sports, so ballroom dancing is probably an area I’m suited for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then let’s start again with the hold]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As before, I danced following Tennouji-san’s lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballroom dancing is supposed to be led by a man so Tennouji-san must’ve had a hard time dancing in an unfamiliar position. However, she never showed any emotions on her face and just kept pulling me along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.It takes a lot more energy than I thought]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said while wiping the sweat dripping from my chin with the collar of my workout clothes after an hour of dancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. …Well, it should’ve been done with a moderate amount of relaxation in between]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, Tennouji-san also wiped her sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come on, let’s resume our practice. Tomonari-san, hold]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I straightened my back and spread my arms, Tennouji-san approached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I remembered what I had been taught and tried to adjust my posture―I suddenly remembered something important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Transparency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because she had been dancing indoors for so long with no ventilation, Tennouji-san was also sweating quite an amount. Her yellow underwear was showing through her white workout clothes. (TN: WHERE IS THIS ILLUST DAMN IT)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This… I shouldn’t look at this directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I paid my respects to Tennouji-san, who was teaching me how to dance. I kept my stance, averting my gaze as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hold on, where are you looking?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I looked in the direction of the day after tomorrow, Tennouji-san questioned me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Look at me properly. Dancing is not only about the way you move your body but also about the way you look at me and the expressions on your face, desuwa?]</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-4718 size-large" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00012-4-733x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="733" height="1024" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00012-4-733x1024.jpeg 733w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00012-4-215x300.jpeg 215w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00012-4-768x1073.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00012-4-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00012-4.jpeg 983w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No… That may be so but…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are circumstances that aren’t easy to notice. But it’s also difficult to tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking about how to answer―Tennouji-san grabbed my face and forced me to face her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come on, look here, look at me like this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right in front of my face and nose, Tennouji-san’s face was spread out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just below that was a sweaty, skin tight workout suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… Tennouji-san. I’m very, very sorry to say this, but…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t keep looking at her as she is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I gathered my resolve and decided to come clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Your…. clothes are transparent from your sweat….]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Clothes?&#8230;..!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally understanding the situation, Tennouji-san hid her breasts with both her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-W-Where are you looking!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You told me to look at you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Tennouji-san changed her sweat-soaked outfit to another outfit.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We resumed our dance practice and waltzed for almost another hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Well, you’ve become better at this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We did a right-handed natural turn and a left-handed reverse turn in a flowing motion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When to open your legs and when to close them. If these two timings don’t match with the partner, the dance can easily fall apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I’m able to dance more comfortably than I expected is because Tennouji-san matches my movements. Even when the angle at which I open my legs becomes too wide, Tennouji-san responds flexibly. She must have a very flexible body. As I followed her graceful movements, even my stiffness seemed to loosen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think that’s enough for today. I think I was a little overzealous in my first practice]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s true… My stamina is already on the edge]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We took a breath together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because I used muscles I normally don’t use, I was also very fatigued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-and by the way, you know…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was packing up my belongings, Tennouji-san called out to me, as if she had some difficulty saying something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;In the future, if you ever find my clothes see through again, please let me know as soon as possible…. Well, it would be embarrassing to find out later]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidgety and embarrassed, Tennouji-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, but… it’s better if you notice it yourself, as much as possible… If I tell you, then I’m the one who sees it…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I don’t have a problem with that either. I believe Tomonari-san isn’t that kind of person…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to be trusted that easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to my daily contact with Hinako, I’ve developed some tolerance, but even I have a limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, this is probably proof that Tennouji-san trusted me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head to reciprocate that trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I put away the equipment used for the dance and walked out of the gymnasium, orange sunlight shone on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was completely tinged by the sunset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m used to ballroom dancing, but I don’t think I’ve ever danced for this long]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san muttered as she lightly stroked her sweat-stained hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, if it’s a family as big as the Tennouji family, wouldn’t you be able to have a lot of opportunities to do so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It depends]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While walking, Tennouji-san explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Unlike a simple dinner, a ball is an event that cannot be held without careful preparation. In most cases, you will receive an invitation in advance to affirm whether or not you will attend. Those who don’t like ballroom dancing usually choose not to attend]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. …Unlike a dinner, it’s easier to turn down, which means that there’s a split between those who enjoy dancing and those who don’t]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s what I mean. Nevertheless, if you decided to attend a ball, showcasing a sloppy dance would be disgraceful, and, of course, being a wallflower would be too.… Dance should be considered a kind of culture that’s well worth learning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head to that statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m rarely invited to balls, so I don’t know when that’ll be… but I hope to be able to dance in front of an audience the next time I am]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you’ve got a new technique, surely you’d want to show it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s a ball that Hinako attends, that could be my ballroom dancing debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Although, we can’t afford to wait too long]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point, Tennouji-san drops her gaze and says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If my arranged marriage is approved, we will no longer be able to spend time together after school as we have now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see, why is that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course, if there’s a man to whom you’ve pledged your future with, you should spend as much of your free time as possible for him]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ask me, that may be true. Since she has a fiance, she would be afraid to meet with other members of the opposite sex in private more than necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… that’ll be lonesome]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but mutter something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Tennouji-san opened her eyes and looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Lonesome, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. …I thought about it again, but I enjoy doing things with Tennouji-san. I’m honestly sad that we will no longer have this kind of time together] (TN: Well why not volunteer becoming said fiance?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told her my true feelings, Tennouji-san looked away, her cheeks flushed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I-Is that so…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She responded in an unusual way and did not look at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if I was being too familiar with my statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Fufufu~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san, who turned her back on me, let out a small chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm, Tennouji-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-It’s nothing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking flustered, Tennouji-san shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then Tomonari-san, I’ll see you tomorrow]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, see you tomorrow]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We parted ways in front of the school’s gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind me, she looked happier than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fufufu~]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After parting with Itsuki and returning to the mansion, Mirei naturally smiled as she headed to her room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Fufufufu~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her legs were light. It was a strange feeling, as if all the fatigue she had accumulated from sweating and practicing for the dance just a few moments ago had been blown away somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(But I enjoy doing things with Tomonari. I’m honestly sad we will no longer have this kind of time together)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words have been roaming around her head after parting with Itsuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each time it does, she gets a warm feeling in her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(He thought he would be lonely)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei put her hand lightly on her chest and began to think.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(So the one who thought it was fun… wasn’t only me)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sunny feeling wasn’t unique to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt as if the feelings in her unconscious mind had been proven correct. It was neither a misunderstanding nor an illusion; she had the same feelings as Itsuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(What should I do to keep these days going on forever…) (TN: Make him your husband, duh)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, she thought about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the arranged marriage got approved, she’ll have fewer opportunities to meet with Itsuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That’s right. However, if I invite him as a guest to the Tennouji family…)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, even if the arranged marriage does happen, she can still meet with Itsuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can have tea parties, study together, and practice dance as they have before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei’s eyes lit up, as if she’d just come up with a great idea, but―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.What is this, am I stupid…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She came back to herself. There’s no way she could do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Tennouji family, Tomonari Itsuki is just a student. There’s no justifiable reason for making him a guest of the family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mirei?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, someone calls out to her from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she turned around, she saw her mother―Tennouji Hanami.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, mother. Is something the matter?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s supposed to be my line~. You were groaning in the hallway, so I thought maybe something was wrong…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s nothing, I was just thinking of something]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei lied as naturally as she breathed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mirei, you… must’ve been having a lot of fun lately]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haven’t you noticed? Ever since you started spending time with Tomonari-san after school, you seem to be having fun lately]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only recently that she became aware that it’s fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she had no idea that this had been expressed in her attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You know, if you don’t mind it. I want to know what kind of person Tomonari-san is to Mirei]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even if you say so… why does mother care about Tomonari-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, he’s the one who influenced my daughter, you know? It’s only natural I’d be curious about him, right~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanami said somewhat happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei felt her mother’s parental love and let out a sigh as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That is true… Tomonari-san, is someone who’s very dedicated]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei told her, recalling the days up to now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[At first, I had the impression that… he was weak or unsure of himself, but that person had a lot of ambition. I could see that he wanted to change himself and that he cherished his days at the academy very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she first met him, he had a bad posture and a frightened demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what overturned this impression was the direct spirit he showed at the tea party and study group a month ago and then recently, after-school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m very happy to see that his etiquette, which seemed to be a learning curve in the beginning, has become familiar to him now. Of course, there’s no doubt that my instruction was good, but Tomonari-san’s earnestness must’ve helped him to master it quickly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She honestly didn’t expect him to learn it so quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was sure that he studied not only after-school, but also after going home. This attitude was worthy of respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Even at today’s dance practice, Tomonari-san… worked very hard, and I can’t wait to see how far he’ll go]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wondered if he was back home, reviewing what he just learned today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, that thought made her happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sounds like you made a good friend]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. When I see Tomonari-san, I feel elated. If possible, I would like to continue to work with him―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she said that, Mirei’s head cooled rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She realized that she’s cherished these days more than she imagined. She almost felt such a desire spewing from her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those days are coming to an end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From now on, she must spend time with another partner, prepared by her mother and father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I would be happy if such a person was my marriage partner]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a squeezed voice, Mirei said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She mustn&#8217;t know. She cannot let her mother know that she’s even remotely disappointed in this marriage proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mirei. I always tell you, you don’t have to be so uptight, you know? You have a habit of holding a lot of things by yourself, but really you should be more free…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Don’t worry about it, mother]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if interrupting her mother’s words, Mirei says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I live in freedom]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Un]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei said with a beautiful smile that charmed her, as she acted majestically as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her mother nodded, looking somewhat sad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m talking about a meeting soon to discuss your arranged marriage. So, Mirei… could you make some time for us soon?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forcing down her looming emotions, Mirei nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the daughter of the Tennouji family, she’s not allowed to be aware of this feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Even so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she’s allowed to say one thing she resents&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she met Itsuki before, she wanted to tell him how she actually felt about her arranged marriage.</span></p>

p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m getting used to taking dance lessons with Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ballroom dancing is performed by a man and a woman in close physical contact. I felt like I looked pretty pathetic at first, but as I watched Tennoji-san&#8217;s serious attitude, the evil feelings I had inside me disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s all for today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, Tennouji-san wiped her sweat lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at my watch and saw that we’d only been practicing for an hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s faster than usual]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I’d like to go on a little longer… but I have some errands to run today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Errands?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I casually asked her back, Tennouji-san’s expression clouded over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s about the arranged marriage I told you about before. Today, I’m meeting the other party]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tennouji-san told me this, her expression was still clouded over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… Tennouji-san, do you have any thoughts about the arranged marriage?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why would you think that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s because you don’t seem very enthusiastic]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d always thought that Tennouji-san was keen on the idea of arranged marriage, and I was going to support her. I remember that she’d shown some anxiety for a while, but it was only because she was nervous about the unknown experience of matchmaking, not the arranged marriage itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I’m starting to think that’s not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, I asked Tennouji-san about her true feelings and―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No need to worry, I’m open minded about arranged marriages]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san answered with a deceptive smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides… I’m in a position where I must accept the offer]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Position…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Since this is a good opportunity, I’ll tell Tomonari-san about it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked at me in a reformed manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… am an adopted child]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My eyes widen at that statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san calmly continued her story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was adopted, but I was taken in by the Tennouji family when I was a baby, so it doesn’t really feel like it… but the point is, I’m not the biological daughter of the Tennouji family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a slightly guilty look on her face, Tennouji-san speaks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Both my father and mother treat me as if I were their own daughter. But still, it&#8217;s an undeniable fact that I don’t have the blood of the Tennouji family in my veins. …Because of this, I must behave in a more befitting way as the daughter of the Tennouji family. Since I don’t have the blood, I must at least carry on with my achievements. This is my duty]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow working it all out in my head, which seemed to be getting lost, I sorted out Tennouji-san’s story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Tennouji-san felt that because of her position as an adopted child, she mustn&#8217;t fail the Tennouji family. Tennouji-san believes that this is her duty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[P-Please wait for a moment]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having sorted out the story, I had a feeling that one of the assumptions I’d been holding on to had been shattered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t tell me, Tennouji-san… you’re accepting your matchmaking because of your obligations?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this question, Tennouji-san nodded her head with a thin smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. But this is a common story for people of our class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be true, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Is this fine for you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it really okay as it is?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately thought of Hinako. Just because you do as your parents say doesn’t mean you’ll be happy. I understand this very well from my relationship with Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time, however, Tennouji-san herself is satisfied with her current circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outside world shouldn’t say anything. Even if I knew that, it still bothered me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My case is a bit unusual, but… you, of all people, would understand, wouldn’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I mean, you’re adopted too, aren’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stiffen with my mouth open at the word that came to me unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Do you remember? What I said before at the study group that Konohana-san and the others attended?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I heard those words, I remembered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a break in the study session, Tennouji-san asked me [Are you really the son of the heir of a medium-sized company].</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;As I recall, you said my mannerism were tacked on and not what you’re educated to be as an heir apparent]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. At that point, I had an idea of your status. Perhaps… you’re like me, a man trying to do his duty to protect his family name]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Tennouji-san thought I was adopted as a result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But―unfortunately, that’s not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s on the right track. Like Tennouji-san, I’m trying to do my duty to protect a family name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the family name I protect belongs to the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not adopted, I’m just a servant employed by the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I cannot explain this to Tennouji-san. That would violate the contract between me and the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have a very good head, but I could still imagine how much trouble I would cause the Konohana family if I revealed myself here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Keep this a secret, please]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. …Fufu, after all, there’s no mistaking my eyes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san smiled happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throbbing, my heart aches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was… the guilt I’ve been pretending to ignore all this time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a while since I returned to the Konohana family mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako curiously approached me when I stopped eating dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ahhh, sorry. What were we talking about?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Talk about… wanting to skip school tomorrow…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think that’s a good idea. Also, we weren’t actually talking about that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako faked a cute [Tehe~] look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah, right. As I remember, we were talking about studying at the academy. We both do a lot of preparation and review, so even though our grades were different, we could still relate in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… next, I want to eat this…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You can eat it yourself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I can’t]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it would be dumb to point out that she was lying, I replied [Yes yes] and brought the pork saute on my plate to Hinako’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hinako was munching and chewing, I took a bite myself. …Delicious. The cream sauce mixed with mustard gave it a mild yet delicious texture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, when does Hinako study while she’s at the mansion?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After school is over, I come home… and until dinner. Sometimes, they make me do it afterwards as well…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact she’s forced to do it is very Hinako-like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you’re going to be doing this at night… you’re going to be studying for quite a while]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not just about studying at the academy. …I also need to know about the achievements of the Konohana Group in order to keep up with the topic at dinners… When I show up for a meeting, I also discuss what I’m going to say in advance…] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I think about it, Hinako and I live in the same mansion, but we don’t always work together. Especially after school up until dinner, I was taking lessons from Shizune-san and Tennouji-san. During that time, Hinako must’ve been working hard on her studies too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san isn’t the only one burdened with the obligations of their house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako too, studies for her house on a daily basis…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Don’t you feel bad about that sort of thing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I uttered the question unconsciously… and immediately realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should’ve known about Hinako’s hardship, but I asked if it’s someone else’s problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry, I didn’t mean to be pitiful. I was… just wondering how Hinako as the daughter of the Konohana family, is facing her duties]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I restated it, Hinako let out a distressed [Hmmmm]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Studying, is… a hassle]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be, well, you know. Obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… I don’t like it when someone is sad because of me, so… sometimes I feel like I have to do my best. …Sometimes, I feel suffocated, even at home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. After all, even Hinako sometimes feels suffocated by her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only natural she could be fatigued to the point of illness. But since this is the first time I’ve heard of it from her own mouth, I once again realize the gravity of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s why… when Itsuki came to save me, I was happy…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, smiling happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My world… It isn’t just the Konohana family, I know that…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako smiled so beautifully that I’d rather look at it than a shooting star. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I had another girl’s face in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said that arranged marriage is common for people of her status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder… if she knows the world outside of the Tennouji family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day, Mirei had a meeting with her matchmaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place was the Tennouji family mansion where Mirei lives. Most people who visit this mansion for the first time usually wilt, but the other party showed no signs of doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His upper-class behavior, his words and actions were rich in decency and culture. Mirei was convinced her parents prepared her for this match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However… It still didn’t clear Mirei’s mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I think it’s time to call it a day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei’s mother, Hanami, announced the end of the dinner party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marriage partner and her mother politely greeted each other one last time before leaving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mirei, good work today~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes… good work desuwa]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother approached Mirei after instructing the maids about cleaning up after the dinner party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How did the meeting go~? From the looks of it, the talks seemed to be going well, right~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think so too. He’s intelligent, and I think he’s a nice person]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei recalled the man sitting opposite her at the dinner party and told her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[He was well groomed and had good manners. …He’s not exactly the son of the heir to a big company, is he? As expected of the one chosen by father and mother desuwa]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After all, all I want is for Mirei to be happy~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother said and smiled softly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However… that man is very sensible, I would say, and elegant and trustworthy…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, what’s wrong with that~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not saying it’s wrong… but if everything is so perfect, there’s no need for me to teach him anything, and I’m sure they wouldn’t do things I would worry about…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What’s wrong with that~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother was puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei herself was bewildered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was I saying? She had that kind of face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, this partner of yours~&#8230; How does he fare compared to Tomonari-san~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-Why is Tomonari-san’s name being mentioned here?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara~? I’m just curious, I don’t have any other intentions~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was something that had nothing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was one handful mother, Mirei sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s a world of difference compared to the son of the heir to a big company. Tomonari-san still lacks in many areas… There are so many things I have to teach him, and if he were present at a dinner like this, I would worry about a lot of things]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara ara, it’s so idealistic~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother said something, but she didn’t understand, so she ignored it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come to think of it, I’ve never thought about this before… What do Tomonari-san’s parents do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I believe they’re a part of the Konohana group, as an IT company. …Though he hasn’t told me the name of the company yet]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, she’s never had that kind of discussion with Itsuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, among students at the Imperial Academy, this kind of topic comes up within a week. Of course, not for rating purposes, but out of genuine interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Tomonari-san’s case… is why he has so many interesting things to says)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both good and bad ways, Itsuki is someone with whom there’s so much to talk about that there’s no time to talk about his family background. This was refreshing and somewhat comforting to Mirei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So it’s an IT company, hmm~. But for an heir, he seems to be a folksy guy in a good way… or rather friendly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her mother put her hand on her cheek and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it’s a medium-sized company, Itsuki is still the heir. For that reason, it must be said that he is indeed a commoner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei knew why. She knew she shouldn’t say anything else, but…. Her mother seemed to like Itsuki a lot. Because she was sure it won’t be a bad thing, Mirei’s mouth opened up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;He’s adopted, just like me. So, it’s no wonder why he’s so friendly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was sure her mother would understand. After all, Mirei herself was adopted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought so, but for some reason, her mother became just a little more serious than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nee, Mirei. That means… Tomonari-san is adopted because they wanted an heir son~?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes… that’s how I think it is]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei wondered and answered the question that she couldn’t grasp the intent of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s strange, isn’t it~? I’ve never heard of an IT company in the Konohana Group having trouble with an heir~&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Monday, three days after I heard that Tennouji-san was meeting with her marriage partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, I was going to the academy with Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is it, Hinako?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How was… studying with Tennouji-san and the others?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I walked out the mansion and towards the gate, Hinako asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m doing well. At this rate, my grades will be better… and by being in contact with someone like Tennouji-san, I’m getting more gutsy in many ways]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Tennouji-san has a unique atmosphere, she’s an upper class student representing the academy. Having become accustomed to interacting with her, I was becoming more comfortable with interacting with others as well. I’m sure I’ll behave better at my next social gathering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san seems to be doing well in her studies too… so maybe Hinako might be beaten in the next competency test]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Muu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako spilled a somewhat grumpy voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she was still sleepy and didn&#8217;t say anything in particular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Both of you can chit-chat as you please, but please walk properly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a few more steps and headed for the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I approached the black car, the waiting driver bowed solemnly. I bowed lightly in response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Shizune-san glared somewhere with her eyes, they flashed sharply, then―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―Intruder!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was astonished when Shizune-san suddenly pointed outside the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, the Konohana family security rushed to the place Shizune-san pointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minute later, one of the security guards approached Shizune and told her that no one was found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Was it my imagination?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a quizzical look, Shizune said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please excuse me. I felt a gaze on us]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Is that so…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never thought I would hear the word “intruder” here in the modern day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But this is strange. Most of the time, my intuition is correct…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If you weren’t imagining it, you’re pretty sharp]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gulped at Shizune-san, who told me something disturbing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What in the world am I getting myself into? (TN: A lot buddy)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got out of the car and headed for the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was changing my shoes in the footwear box, I was approached by Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san, good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s rare to meet in such a place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking this, I looked at Tennouji-san and saw that she had a serious look on her face. I wondered if she had something she wanted to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san. I’ll be straight to the point. ―Have you been lying to me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question pierced through my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was intensely surprising. But I didn’t let it show on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two things I have lied about to Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is that I got inside the Imperial Academy through non-legal ways. The second is that I’m under the care of the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither can be known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well, what could you be talking about?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san nodded, looking a little disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. I’m sorry for being so weird]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-No. It’s fine…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did she suddenly ask that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious, but couldn’t ask because I felt that prying would lead to something outrageous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to cancel today’s lesson. I have some urgent business to attend to]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. …Is it the arranged marriage?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, not this time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With eyes lit with a somewhat angry emotion, Tennouji-san said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s something more important than that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened my locker in the footwear box and saw something outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An envelope was in my locker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, the following words were written in masterful handwriting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―A letter of challenge.</span></p>
