<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 1 : Tennouji Mirei’s Proposal</span></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, I’m off]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got out of the car and bowed to Shizune-san and the driver.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was walking about ten meters in front of me. I kept that distance and headed towards the academy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Konohana-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, Tomonari-san. Good morning]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met up with Hinako at the shoe-box area and we greeted each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, I already greeted Hinako in her room this morning… But this is the first time I greeted her in public.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, playing the role of a perfect Ojou-sama, is so affable, yet exudes a highbrow demeanor that makes anyone of the opposite gender agitated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I preferred the usual and original Hinako, probably because I knew who she really was.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Every time, it’s such a pain]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What is?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hinako revealed her true feelings in a small voice, I asked back in a whisper, while paying attention to the ears around me.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In the morning, we go together… then I have to leave first and meet up with you later]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;We don’t have a choice. It’d be bad if someone found out we live together]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s cramped, but it’s still better.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through tea parties and study sessions, it seems that the fact that Hinako and I are friends has already become a well-known fact in the academy. Therefore, compared to the start, I no longer have to keep my distance with Hinako as much as I used to. We can have normal conversations in the classroom, and even if they see us spending time together, we can cover it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… I want to go to school together]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We’re in the same car the entire commute though, right? We just split up at the end]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not like that…]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, lowering her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I want… the two of us walk outside together]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s how it is.　</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I would like to agree, I don’t think it’s something easy to achieve, unfortunately. …I’ll talk to Shizune-san the next time I see her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah! The two of you!]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed my shoes and was heading to class with Hinako when I ran into my classmate, Asahi-san, on the way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Unn, morning! You know, I heard the results of the mid term exams are now posted in front of the staff room, so why don’t we go see it together?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san said as she looked at me and Hinako.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Kiou Academy, the ranks of the students are announced each time the regular examinations are held. However, only the top 50 students are publicly announced, which probably didn’t include me.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Hinako and we nodded our heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m okay with that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I would be happy to join you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was still plenty of time before classes began.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t have to be in the classroom just yet, and to be honest, I was interested in the ranking placements. I didn’t have anything like this at my old high school…　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three of us headed towards the staff room.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our way there, I spotted a familiar boy.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Taisho-kun]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oooh. You all came]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho noticed us and smiled lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Taisho-kun isn’t on it anyway]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shut up. I want to see what I want even if I’m not listed]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho then looked at the rankings posted on the bulletin board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also turn our eyes to the bulletin board, following him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first place, the first name we saw, was someone we all knew well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The first place this time is still Konohana-san. As expected from her!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fufu, thank you very much]</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako smiled with the elegant smile of an ojou-sama. Her beauty attracted the gazes of the students around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing her true self, I sometimes forget Hinako is a talented person in both studies and sports.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though… it’s only her skill that’s excellent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her skills only.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ouch-]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Hinako stepped on my foot.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You were thinking something rude, weren’t you?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How’d she know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked away from Hinako, who was pouting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to before, Hinako seemed to be more expressive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s not an act, it’s real. I think it’s a good thing. I don’t know what triggered the change though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change in Hinako may not be bad at all.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I thought about this, I suddenly moved my gaze to the side and saw a girl with blonde hair in vertical rolls who stood out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl held a finger to her chin and made some kind of difficult face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious to see how she was doing, so I called out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, Tomonari-san is here as well]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji Mirei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s the daughter of the Tennouji Group, a conglomerate comparable to the Konohana Group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took one look at the bulletin board she was looking at earlier and opened my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Congratulations on second place]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;As long as that hateful name is in the first place, I can’t rejoice]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I was being honest in my praise, but Tennouji-san looked frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, Tennouji-san has been competitive with Hinako ever since they first met. She wouldn’t be satisfied when Hinako’s name was written above hers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But this time, the results were significant]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I tilted my head, Tennouji-san explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The gap between me and Konohana-san has narrowed down compared to last time. This doesn’t mean Konohana-san’s score has dropped. This means that this is undeniably my growth…! Fufufu, I finally see a chance to win…!]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san muttered, flames burning inside her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, what place did you come in?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She asked me so naturally that I didn’t think when replying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wasn’t on the list. I’m probably average or a little below average]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pardon?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san asked, emitting a faintly angry tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What was that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm, well, I’d say I’m average or slightly below…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Below average, despite being personally tutored… by me?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blue streak appeared on Tennouji-san’s forehead.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-The problems you taught me had good results]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shut it!]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She snapped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You still lack self-awareness! No matter how serious you are, if your goals are low, you will never grow, will you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes…]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentence hit home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my part, I was going to grow little by little while figuring out what I want, but that may have been a little bit too humble of an idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Bent back]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yes]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she pointed it out, I straightened my back, which had bent for some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geez… I’ve always thought you’re the type of person whose emotions tend to show from your attitude]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Is that so…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t aware of that.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[On the other hand, if you felt more confident, that would radiate much more]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, Tennouji-san showed a pretense of thinking.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will she say next? I waited nervously…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have a proposal. Why don’t you spend some time after school with me for the next couple of days?]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said something that was completely different from what I expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I replied, Tennouji-san smiled with satisfaction. 　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then I’ll personally teach you some manners! The Tennouji family is a family that places great importance on etiquette. Manners are my specialty!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She put her hand on her chest and said [I’ll take care of it!].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, that’d be very helpful. It’s very helpful, but it’s not a decision I can make on my own. That being spending time after school with someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I really appreciate what you’re saying, but… let me think about it first]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Tennouji-san looked at me strangely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why? I thought you were interested?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’m not allowed to make my own schedule due to my position]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. Sounds like a rough house]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you call it a challenge, it could really be one. After all, it’s the Konohana Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I’ve gotten used to it lately, I feel a little shrugged off at times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a light sigh as I remembered my daily struggles… and realized that Tennouji-san was staring at me silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san, do you behave the same way when you are at home as you do now?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When you say “as now”, do you mean&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What I mean is an attitude that seems somewhat ostentatious without an ounce of confidence]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That one felt too close for comfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, if I’m hesitant right now, I’m sure I’m the same as when I’m at the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Maybe… I’m also like this at home]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I answered, Tennouji-san sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I invited you for one more reason besides your grades. It’s about your behavior at the academy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked me straight in the eye and continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll ask you straight.―Do you feel inferior to those around you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, I thought my heart had been grabbed by an eagle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not to say that it was a shock to hear the truth… It was due to the fact that she saw something even I myself wasn&#8217;t aware of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m the only commoner in the academy. Compared to everyone else, I’m inferior in everything, including my intelligence and family background.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, I don’t mind it that much, but the fact of it suddenly crossed my mind. I wouldn’t normally be allowed to enroll in the academy, and I’m only here because of the power of the Konohana family. It’d be difficult not to feel inferior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―I might have an inferiority complex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all this time, I still think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps sensing my stagnant state of mind, Tennouji-san continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not uncommon for students at Kiou Academy to suffer from this kind of complex. But fortunately, you have ambition. I promise you that under my guidance, you will be able to break free from this complex]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was such a gratifying proposal that I almost agreed to it right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to contribute more to Hinako as a caretaker. The more this feeling takes shape, the more challenges appear. It may seem naive, but I have a feeling that if Tennouji-san could teach me how to study and behave in a proper manner, all of these problems would be resolved at once.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I must get back to the classroom now. I would appreciate hearing back from you as soon as possible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand. I will get back to you tomorrow]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll talk to Shizune-san about it as soon as I get back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for calling out to me. …Tennouji-san really has an eye for people, doesn’t she? Frankly, I didn’t expect you to see through me so well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m flattered. It’s not a big deal]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I really think it’s great]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told her I was impressed once again, Tennouji-san looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s really not that big of a deal. …It’s just, I’ve been there myself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter half of the sentence was mostly muttered to herself, so I hardly heard it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the only thing that remained strong in my memory was the unusually gloomy expression on Tennouji-san’s face for someone who always acted so stout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back at the Konohana family mansion, I was receiving lessons from Shizune-san as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That concludes today’s lesson. Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparation, review, etiquette classes, and self-defense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With each one completed, I finally realized the day was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to be so exhausted at this time that I couldn’t even speak, but now I have a little more time and energy to spare. I guess that means I’m growing both physically and mentally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this I must head to Hinako’s room and take a bath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wiped my sweat lightly and looked at Shizune-san, who was checking through documents at hand with a difficult face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are those documents?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is the schedule regarding the lessons for Itsuki-san. You’re growing faster than I expected, so I thought I’d readjust it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san read the documents with a serious expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Maybe now was the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Break time after 1st period.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Tennouji-san a question about her offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What do you mean by spending time together after school?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will tutor you on studying]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san went on to explain her intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I participated in the study session you organized a while back… but to tell you the truth, that was the first time I ever taught anyone anything]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. So, I realized for the first time that… it seems the act of teaching others is also good for me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What… does that mean, exactly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san told me as I wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In short, by teaching others how to study, I also improve my own academic abilities. The results of this are shown from the test results. I was able to close the gap against Konohana-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand the story now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So are you saying that Tennouji-san would like to continue doing things like the study session in the future?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s what I mean]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understood the point and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, why did you choose me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s because you have the lowest grades of anyone I’m close to] (TN: ouch that hurt, jeez) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh&#8230;.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sorry, but I have no defense for that.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, if we do it this way, I will only bother you. I wish there was something I could do to pay you back…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s already great if you can teach me how to study better]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No. It’s for my own convenience that I am teaching you. It’s not fair that I don’t pay something to you as well]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s someone who abides by the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than my feelings, I guess Tennouji-san herself isn’t convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you not good at anything other than studying?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Something I’m not good at…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember all the mistakes I have made since I became a caretaker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m far from perfect in my studies, exercise, work at the mansion, and self defense, but worst of all… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Manners, I guess]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san. I’d like to discuss a few things with you…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, I explained to Shizune-san about what I talked to Tennouji-san about today.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was about studying and learning manners from Tennouji-san after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see. To have such a talk with Tennouji-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Shizune-san heard the story, she put down the documents and pondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san, what do you want to do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I personally would like to take it. Tennouji-san’s teaching style is good… and I can count on her for many things]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san taught me well, but Tennouji-san is a classmate of mine, so she gives me advice from the  point of view of a student. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides―Tennouji-san told me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Do you feel inferior to those around you?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I promise you that under my guidance, you will be able to break free from this complex』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words resonate strongly in my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san is always so imposing and is truly a student worthy of Kiou Academy. I’m sure I was admiring Tennouji-san, although I’ve never been aware of it until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I feel that with Tennouji-san’s guidance… I can become more worthy to Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would be able to accompany Hinako anytime she needs to relax. And when the time comes, I would be able to support her perfectly. In order to be that kind of caretaker, there are still too many things I’m lacking. I hope to fix these problems with Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see no issues with that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san continued to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-sama will be able to teach you manners better than I can. Besides… I have a message from Keigon-sama. He wants Itsuki-san to actively make connections for the Konohana family on behalf of Ojou-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Keigon-san did?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I hope you’re aware of this, in the same way that you invited Miyakojima-sama, Tennouji-sama, and the others to your social gathering. Events like that will help put a good face on Ojou-sama]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, I was surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had the feeling that he didn’t trust me very much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Keigon-san’s attitude towards me changed, it must’ve been because of the social circle. That night, I felt as if I heard his true feelings for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. If that’s the case, I’ll try my best]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thank you for your cooperation…. But please, keep it within the natural student-like range]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As fellow students. As friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If making connections within that scope, I guess that means I’m free to do it as I go along. Then, it will eventually tie to Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, the door to the dojo opened, and Hinako’s voice was heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Bath… not yet?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry, I was talking to Shizune-san for a little]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Talking?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained to Hinako, who tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was going to tell Hinako about it,, but do you mind if we don’t go home together after school for a while]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s eyes widened in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was hired by Keigon-san once again, so I wanted to learn a lot of things by getting my act together. I want to improve my grades at the academy and learn some manners so I don’t look like a fool in social situations. To do this, I need to use some time after-school for a while]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you being taught by someone? …What about Shizune?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san answered that question for me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I also have other work to do, so sometimes it’s difficult to concentrate on Itsuki-san’s lessons. Especially these days, due to the recent social gathering, my work has increased… so I may not be able to devote time to his lessons for a while]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuu. Then, what about if I teach you…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think it will be tough on Ojou-sama because she has a lot of things she needs to get done. Besides, it will be good for Itsuki-san’s growth to change his environment and learn from various places]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, Hinako was displeased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako thought about something for 30 seconds, and eventually, she said something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki. …Is it for me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know it’s a little different to say it’s for Hinako’s sake…. But it’s to make sure that I do my job as a caretaker properly]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to sound patronizing, but I’m willing to take this on because I want to help Hinako more than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let out a distressed [Nuuuuu], and sighed.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, I have no choice. …I forgive you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thanks]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako gave me her permission. 　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will let Tennouji-san know tomorrow that I will accept her offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… who will teach you study, manners, and so…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered her question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san will]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told Hinako again, who seemed a little surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think I’ll be spending some time with Tennouji-san after school] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[………………………]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the bathroom in Hinako’s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched over Hinako as she soaked in the bathtub and ate an ice cream stick.　</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4663" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00008-4-733x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="733" height="1024" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00008-4-733x1024.jpeg 733w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00008-4-215x300.jpeg 215w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00008-4-768x1072.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00008-4-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00008-4.jpeg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Delish~~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed bitterly as Hinako showed her real personality, unlike at the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Will you forgive me with this?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, it’s still lacking]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think I can do more. It’s hard enough to bring ice cream without Shizune-san finding out]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a sigh, Hinako dropped her gaze and opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I still don’t really like it… but I’ll forgive this one time]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, I asked permission to spend time with Tennouji-san. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako had been opposing the idea ever since we talked about it at the dojo until now, but it was the ice cream bribe that was the decisive factor in convincing her. Perhaps, she’s happy to have a break after a long time, as she’s been busy with the dismissal of her caretaker, social events, and other messes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hinako still seemed dissatisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to Hinako, who stared sulkily at the water surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can turn this down if Hinako doesn’t want me to go…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I don’t want to get in the way of Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if she’s concerned about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, that’s my role as a caretaker, but… I’m a little happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Honestly, I’m a bit relieved]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Relieved…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought Hinako has been avoiding me lately]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Why did you think that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I mean, you didn’t want me to wake you up in the morning anymore, and besides, you’ve been distant from me sometimes, haven&#8217;t you?] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Hinako pouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not like I want to keep my distance]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then what’s your reason?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a complicated expression, Hinako muttered quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I don’t want to say it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious, but if she wasn’t going to tell me, I wasn’t going to pry either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Isn’t it hot, dressed like that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, in front of me, was wearing the school swimsuit designed by the academy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an elegant design, typical of Kiou Academy. However, it was a little too thick to use in the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Not really]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’ve been wearing a bikini type swimsuit until now. Why did you suddenly change to a school swimsuit?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I just felt like it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako replied with a very difficult answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought inwardly about Hinako, who looked away and had her back turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―I wonder if she was still avoiding me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, she would ask to bathe together like this and talk about wanting to spend time together after school as much as possible… but right now, I don’t know what Hinako’s thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been spending time with Hinako for more than a month now as her caretaker. I thought I was getting to know her thoughts little by little, but recently, I can’t read her intentions anymore. What does this mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Cmon, just wash my hair]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s think about it later. I put my hand on Hinako’s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s ears were stained red, as if she was flustered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mmmm…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako let out a satisfied sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, at least she wouldn’t let someone she didn’t like touch her hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was washing Hinako’s hair with shampoo, she told me in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This kind of thing… don’t do it with Tennouji-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did she say?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded with some relief as I sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wouldn’t do that] (EDN: so something is gonna happen) (TN: Who would’ve thought)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you know how hard I had to work to get used to this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I don’t think of it much, but when I first became a caretaker, it was difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, I noticed that Hinako’s hair was caught in the shoulder straps of her swimsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m going to move your shoulder strap just a little]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I shifted and lowered her left shoulder strap, I thought I heard a strange voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you have long hair, this kind of thing is difficult]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Itsuki…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll be done in a minute. It’ll be quick]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Hinako jumped up and down and then hurriedly got into the bathtub. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bubbles floated on the surface of the water. At the center of it, Hinako was staring at me with a bright red face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu…!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mu?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmph, insensitive..!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked embarrassed and put her hands on both shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Insensitive…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an odd line from someone who had voluntarily taken off her swimsuit.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During break, I told Tennouji-san that I received permission for her offer, and we immediately decided to start a study session after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, I’ll teach you a thing or two!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[P-Please go easy on me…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the other students left school, Tennouji-san and I met up at a cafe next to the cafeteria. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after all this time, I wondered if I would be able to keep up. Tennouji-san was so full of motivation that I had such concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fufufu… overthrow… Konohana Hinako…! This time, I’m going to make that smile of yours twitch…!] (EDN: You already succeeded)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san declared with a devilish smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san, who had arrived earlier, ordered drinks for me as well, and as soon as I took my seat, a cup of tea was served to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[First, let’s set a goal. My goal is to defeat Konohana Hinako in the next exam]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said, tipping her cup gracefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When is the next exam?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A month from now]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first place, it looked like Tennouji-san’s and Hinako’s scores were very close. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month of intense study, there’s a good chance Tennouji-san could win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san, you will score in the top 50 in that exam]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised by her sudden statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In the top 50…? I’m a little below average right now… that’s a bit…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No need to worry. I’m here to teach you how]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gave Tennouji-san, who was puffing out her chest with confidence, a complicated look. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more I complain, the more trouble I’m putting myself in. So I’ll make an effort to believe in her here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And, Tomonari-san said you wanted to be taught more about etiquette… Is there a reason for that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered Tennouji-san’s question carefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When I attended the Konohana family social gathering… I felt that I still wasn’t good enough to act natural in such situations. At the very least, I’d like to learn etiquette in a way that doesn’t embarrass myself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s a good objective]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san nodded in satisfaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then I’ll teach Tomonari-san some social etiquette. I should be able to teach you table etiquette, speaking skills, and dancing as well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[D-Dancing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What dances can you do, Tomonari-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I wanted to answer…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had to say one, something I practiced during the sports festival―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Maybe Soran Bushi?] (TN: Soran Bushi is a traditional Japanese dance. For reference, you can check Kaguya-sama Love is War S2 EP 10)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pardon?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. I can’t dance at all]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t dance Soran Bushi in a social gathering. No, on the contrary, it might attract attention, but I would lose my status in exchange for laughter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then I’ll teach you the basics of dancing as well]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said, muttering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We have the general plan in place. Let’s get started by studying first. We’ll study until 6:00 p.m., and then we’ll move on to etiquette]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, I’m looking forward to working with you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6:00 p.m.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s studying ended without a hitch. I solved the last question from the textbook and now Tennouji-san was checking my answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking over my answers, Tennouji-san muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It seems that you study hard even on a regular basis. At this rate, I’m sure your grades will get better than before]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san’s lessons were also helpful, but Tennouji-san is also a student, so she can give me tips on how to get higher grades. I should probably acquire a wide range of knowledge and skills for the future, but what I need now is a grade that wouldn’t be inconvenient for me to be around Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How about you, Tennouji-san? Do you think this is helpful to you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. It was better than I thought it’d be. Maybe I have a talent for teaching people things]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said, surprising even herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being just the two of us, both Tennouji-san and I were able to concentrate in today’s study session. But the reason I was able to concentrate on my studies was probably because Tennouji-san taught me so earnestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why is Tennouji-san being so competitive with Konohana-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, I asked something that had bothered me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s no deep reason for it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san gazed down a little, then looked me in the eyes and answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I would like to point out that there is no such relationship between myself and Konohana-san. …If I had a reason, it is because I’m the daughter of the Tennouji family and cannot afford to fall behind other students]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That is… Is that like a family motto?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No. It’s a rule I set for myself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did she impose such harsh rules on herself?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To my question, Tennouji-san continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The academy is a microcosm of society, so to speak. If you lose here, you will surely lose in the future. …I believe that the Tennouji Group is the best corporate group in Japan. As such, defeat is against my belief]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought her declaration was a proud ideal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone had said this at my old high school, I would’ve thought the’re joking. But this academy is a special environment. Tennouji-san’s statement had a sense of reality… and above all, because it was said by Tennouji-san, who acted with sincerity on a daily basis, it demonstrated her real intent to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, on the other hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born and raised as a commoner, I couldn’t help but ask a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Have you ever thought of it as a struggle?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Not at all]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san responded immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As the daughter of the Tennouji family, I will contribute to the Tennouji family. That is my mission… and the happiness that I desire]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way she asserted this with confidence was very typical of Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reflected on the unnecessary question I had asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, on to etiquette]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting away the textbooks, Tennouji-san prepared for the next lesson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san. I have one favor to ask you. First, can I ask you to focus on table etiquette?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s fine, but do you have a reason for doing so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Well… personal reasons]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t confident I could explain it well, so I apologized and drank my tea. Tennouji-san may have guessed what it was, but decided not to pry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If so, Tomonari-san. Why don’t you have dinner with me for a while?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Dinner, was it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. That way, we’ll be able to teach table etiquette in a practical way. Fortunately, this academy provides a variety of cuisines from different countries, so we’ll be able to cover the full range of this topic]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. So we’re going to continue to study table etiquette while having dinner at the academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an efficient proposal that I would like to accept, but let’s consult with Shizune-san to be sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll talk about it with my house]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that said, I excused myself and took out my phone in the back of the school building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『What’s wrong, Itsuki-sama?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san called me by “sama”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess they’re pretending to be servants under me in case someone is listening to the call on the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san suggested that I have dinner at the academy for a while starting today, is that okay? Seems like she’s going to teach me table etiquette]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I understand. There’s no problem, but…』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san stopped mid-sentence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Excuse me. Ojou-sama would like to talk, so please wait a moment』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if she has something to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Itsuki…?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah? What’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;Will you be late today?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako asked in a slightly disappointed voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think I will for today, or at least for a while]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reply, Hinako was silent for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Quickly… come back, okay?』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Hinako returned the phone to Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『That’s why I’d appreciate it if you could come back as soon as possible』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about what time to ask Shizune-san to pick me up, consulting with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shouldn’t forget my real job. I’m Hinako’s caretaker. I’m in the position of being taught by Tennouji-san, but I’ll be there for Hinako as much as possible so that I don’t end up in the same situation as before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry to keep you waiting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I returned to the cafe, Tennouji-san had begun preparing for the next lesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must’ve asked the waiter at the cafe because a variety of tableware was laid out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is, once again, the real deal…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m just trying to motivate you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said proudly, her chest puffing with pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a little late for this, but is that okay? I’m the one benefiting from all this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought we were over that already. I’m having a good time in my own way, so don’t worry about it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, Tennouji-san continued in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And… you’re so much like me in the past that I wanted to help a little]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What do you mean…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, let’s begin the lesson]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if to shrug it off, Tennouji-san began the lesson.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4174" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00009-4.jpeg" alt="" width="538" height="751" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00009-4.jpeg 538w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00009-4-215x300.jpeg 215w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00009-4-75x106.jpeg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8:00 p.m. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Tennouji-san’s class was over, I drove back to the Konohana family mansion in the car provided.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m back]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good work, Itsuki-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon entering the mansion, I immediately met Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think I’ll be arriving at the mansion at this time for a while]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. May I ask what you learned, to be sure?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I walked to my room, I explained what Tennouji-san taught me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―It’s like that] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see. …I should thank Tennouji-sama again next time. From what I’ve heard, she’s been teaching quite seriously]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s right]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was something I realized as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said she was having a good time as well, but if viewed from the outside, no matter how I look at it, I’m unilaterally benefitting from it. I will have to thank her once again.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But why did you make learning table etiquette a priority?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh, about that…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a little embarrassing, but I would be happy to tell Shizune-san. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained my intentions. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that what you meant?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m glad to see that you haven’t forgotten your role as caretaker]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well… That was the reason why I’m learning so much from Tennouji-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said this, Shizune-san smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, Ojou-sama wants to see Itsuki-san, so please head over as soon as possible]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh, are there no self-defense lessons?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Once the dance lessons start, you will be physically exhausted. With future plans in mind, let’s temporarily lower the priority on self-defense]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After discussing with Tennouji-san, the dance lessons were scheduled to begin roughly a week from now. Since we couldn’t have dance lessons in a quirky cafe, we needed to arrange a venue first. Since we haven’t made those arrangements, we didn’t have any today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides, the dojo is often occupied these days]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Used?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked her back, Shizune-san gave me a complicated look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When you beat up the Konohana family guards before, it seems that their pride was severely hurt. …Since then, more and more of them have been training at the dojo]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Somehow, I’m sorry]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It wasn’t Itsuki-san’s fault. Rather, it was a good medicine for them]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If Itsuki-san intends to become a bodyguard for the Konohana family in the future, I would start self-defense lessons right now but… do you want that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I have no such plans at the moment, so I’ll pass]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so. That’s a shame]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it really a shame…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san is a person who I have a hard time understanding when she is joking and being serious, but I thought it sounded more genuine than it seemed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that…ok?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is such a life plan possible?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I bathed Hinako, I went back to my room to prepare for tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As expected, my head seems tired from all the things today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I placed my pen on the notebook and stretched lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time is now 11:00 p.m. Today’s been mostly filled with studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, it’s times like these where I must push through]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed my pen again and flipped the pages of my notebook. Tennouji-san just praised me for my study routine. Let’s keep our heads up and do our best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sometimes think that I’ve become a very hard worker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone I met at Kiou Academy is of a high level. Seeing them, I had made it a habit to study every day. At first, I just studied as Shizune-san told me, but now I do it on my own accord. Shizune-san may have noticed this, and recently, she no longer tells me to [Study in advance] or [Review every day].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never made such a serious effort before. Previously I felt like I was just going to high school for nothing; not for anyone, not even for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Those guys… I wonder what they’re up to]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the relationships I had before I became a caretaker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt as though I would like to meet and talk again once things calm down. (EDN: Flag?)(TN: oh you know it)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, a knock came at my door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s open]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door opened, and it revealed Hinako behind it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh… Hinako?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was astonished by Hinako who made a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You came here all by yourself? You didn’t get lost?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muu… rude. This is still my house]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, no, you can’t say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never forget. This girl, even in the academy, will get lost if left alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki’s room, farther than I thought. …It took me about 30 minutes from my room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not that far…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you exploring a dungeon?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What are you doing?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s preparation for tomorrow&#8217;s exam. Tennouji-san has been teaching me a lot of things, but that’s just basic preparation for it. I have to do my best to keep up with the class]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having finished the material at the end of the page, I turn around and look at Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doing?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nothing]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[? Then why did you come here?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked her this, Hinako pouted a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Can I not come here unless I have something to do?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, not really but…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that she can’t, it’s just hard to deal with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since she didn’t seem to have anything to do, I kept on studying with Hinako in mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muu….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I silently did my questions, Hinako made a dissatisfied noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she slipped and rolled into my bed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m going to sleep here today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sleeping here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She told me in a slightly stronger tone. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The dining room is a long way from my room, so you’ll have trouble tomorrow morning. If you want to sleep, it’s better to go back to your room…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Noo~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was already almost asleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chuckled at Hinako’s fluttering eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Come here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped my studying and headed towards Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Pat]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, squinting sleepily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[When we were at the party, you didn’t like it when I patted your head. Is it fine now?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I didn’t mean to do that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako rolled over and turned her back to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… have been acting weird lately]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Weird… are you feeling sick?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to her in concern, she instead puffed her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant she was still okay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I slowly stroked her head, Hinako’s body jerked, but then quickly calmed down and accepted it. This was something I hadn’t seen til recently. I was told she didn’t hate it, but I’m still worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m getting sleepy too]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down on the floor and muttered to myself as I stroked Hinako’s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Sleep now?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I have to carry Hinako to her room first…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while saying something like that, I started to feel really sleepy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been using my head all day, so my brain must be tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, I was fast asleep and――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hand patting Hinako’s head stopped and she quietly brought herself up.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itsuki was sleeping quietly on the side of his bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako got up as quietly as she could and observed the situation.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I think this is the first time I’ve seen his sleeping face]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the fatigue from her daily acting, Hinako sleeps whenever she gets the chance. Therefore, while others may have seen her sleeping face, she rarely has the time to do the same.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Were you tired..?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking back, Itsuki looked sleepier than usual at his desk today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew how it feels to want to sleep when you’re tired and so, Hinako decided to leave Itsuki asleep like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then looked at the study materials open on his desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako glanced at the notebook filled with mathematical formulas, and suddenly saw something.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This… is the caretaker’s manual?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She picked up the thick book and flipped through the pages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, there was no such thing as a manual for them. However, because of the rapid change of staff, it took a lot of time and effort to verbally explain the work, and this is how the manual originated.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manual had sticky notes and highlights on the areas that were important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the page with a lot of sticky notes, there were several brands of Hinako’s favorite ice cream. Next to them were written [Buy it when you can, and keep it in the freezer in your room!] boldly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She felt an ache in her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pain subsided right as someone entered the room</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune stepped towards her with a curious look on her face.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The door was open, and I was curious as to why…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Shhh]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako raised her index finger in front of her lips and looked at the sleeping Itsuki.</span></p>


<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-4230" src="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00010-3-733x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="566" height="791" srcset="https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00010-3-733x1024.jpeg 733w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00010-3-215x300.jpeg 215w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00010-3-768x1072.jpeg 768w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00010-3-75x106.jpeg 75w, https://www.neosekaitranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/00010-3.jpeg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune then realized the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Goodness. You’re not fit to be a caretaker if you sleep before Ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Shizune said that, her expression wasn&#8217;t angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Shizune also recognized Itsuki’s recent efforts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basically, Itsuki is serious. Even if Shizune doesn’t say anything, he will naturally reflect on it when he wakes up.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama. If you’d like, I can show you to your room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako nodded and left the room with Shizune.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… changed]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, as if muttering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m happy that Itsuki is taking care of me, but… I sometimes feel bad when I think that he’s taking care of me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Feel bad, is it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago, she would’ve suspected that something was wrong with Itsuki, but not anymore. They’ve been working together for more than a month and Shizune knew very well that Itsuki was a sincere person.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you dissatisfied with Itsuki-san being your caretaker?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s not it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako shook her head. However, her expression was uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reaching the front of Hinako’s room, Shizune opened the door. Hinako slowly entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not it, but… it feels lacking]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Hinako sank her body into her bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing her arms over her eyelids, Hinako vented out her worries.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it because of his job that… Itsuki listens to me…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing those words, Shizune finally understood the true feelings of Hinako’s anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She can’t help but smile, but tried to hold back on making any expressions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Rest assured]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a gentle tone of voice, Shizune said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san doesn’t listen to you just because of his job, Ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Really?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. If you just wait a little longer, I think you’ll be able to see that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, Itsuki took on this job simply because he had no money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if it was simply about money, he wouldn’t have wanted to protest against Keigon and become a caretaker again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the past was, the current Itsuki is different. Now, Itsuki is a caretaker who feels a greater obligation towards Hinako than his job. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako doesn’t realize that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s something that’s easy to figure out when you spend time thinking about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[However, this is the first time, isn&#8217;t it? I can’t believe Ojou-sama is asking me for personal advice like this]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that true?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?] Hinako recalls her past while tilting her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune smiled when she saw this. A feeling akin to watching her daughter grow up  came over her.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I shouldn’t do that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn’t intend to be a mother yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After putting the bed sheet over Hinako, who slept before she knew it, Shizune left the room.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A week has passed since I started studying with Tennouji-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked to the classroom and said my greeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students nearby returned my greeting with good natured smiles. Feeling a little moved, I took my seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently… I felt that I was able to adapt to the atmosphere of the academy. I’m starting to get used to it, but I think it really began when Tennouji-san was teaching me. The more I know about etiquette, the more I see the students value them. My desire to respond to them seemed to be linked with my own goals.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yoo, Tomonari]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Tomonari-kun]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho and Asahi-san approached me.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve been wondering, Tomonari. Lately, have you been doing something with Tennouji-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho asked suddenly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fufufu~&#8230; There’s been a lot of rumors recently. After school, they would meet up and do something]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san also said as if it was interesting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt that they were taking things in the wrong direction, so I decided to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually, I’ve been taking etiquette lessons from Tennouji-san recently]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Etiquette?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to Asahi-san’s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s like an extension of the study session from before]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What, I thought it was just Tomonari trying to get the upper hand]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Unfortunately not]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said flatly to Asahi-san who was making wild assumptions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, speak of the devil]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said and looked at the classroom door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked in that direction, I saw Tennouji-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san was beckoning for me to come to her, or rather, focused her gaze on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if something happened, and I headed over to Tennouji-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san, good morning. Is something wrong?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning. Actually, I have something to talk about]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I forgot about it, but the cafe we usually use to study has regular day-offs. That’s today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… Is that so]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, after school, we use the cafe next to the cafeteria. Since that cafe has various menus of food, we also use it for table etiquette lessons.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then we’ll have the study session somewhere else today… and we’ll take a break from etiquette] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve thought about it, and I have a suggestion]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why don’t you come over to my house?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Pardon?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at her sudden proposal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The biggest hurdle to learning etiquette are habits. No matter how nervous you are at first, when you get used to the environment, you’ll calm down eventually. …But that’s the result of environmental adaptation, not because of etiquette lessons]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… I guess that’s true]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. That’s why I thought it’d be better to regularly change the places to prevent Tomonari-san from getting used to the environment. It’s a good opportunity, so why not do it at my house?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san gave a detailed explanation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that proposal, I―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8212;&#8212;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;And that’s how it is, what do you think?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunch break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, I joined Hinako at the old school building and told her about the proposal Tennouji-san gave me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told I’m free to do anything regarding the relationships I make in the academy, but I’m still Hinako’s caretaker. And so, I thought it’d be great to hear Hinako’s opinion first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuu]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuumuumumu…] (TN: she’s cosplaying as a cow?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unusually, Hinako was thinking hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, I don’t think you need to think that much… Hinako crossed her arms and had a difficult look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Are you staying overnight?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, Hinako asked without making eye contact. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it’s just a day trip]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Then, it’s fine]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite saying that, she still had a difficult expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki. …Is studying with Tennouji-san fun?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well. Tennouji-san isn’t the type who goes easy even on acquaintances, but I think I’m getting the hang of it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Hmmm]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s rare to find someone who can be strict even with acquaintances. Normally, when dealing with them, the feeling of “I don’t want to be disliked” comes out at the top, but that’s not the case with Tennouji-san. Perhaps it’s because she has absolute confidence in herself that she’s able to focus on how she acts rather than what others think of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly admire that kind of dignified behavior, even ignoring my current position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking of this, Hinako tugged the hem of my uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;My caretaker]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… is my caretaker]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stared right at me making the distance between us zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her neat face was spread out before her nose, which surprised me a little. For some reason, Hinako smelled good, even though we live in the same mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I know]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I exhaled slowly to calm down my nerves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I slowly looked at the bento in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know, so… stop sneaking vegetables into my bento]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;&#8230;.I’ve been found out]</span></p>
