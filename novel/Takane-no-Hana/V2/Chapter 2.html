<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 2 : Welcome to The Tennouji Family</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I received permission from Hinako to visit the Tennouji family, and immediately after, received permission from Shizune-san as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school, I got into the car with Tennouji-san and headed to the mansion that she usually lives in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So this is Tennouji-san’s house…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Hinako, Tennouji-san also seemed to spend most of her time at her villa, so I was taken there instead of the main residence. However, like I thought at the time with Hinako, it was a large mansion that shouldn’t be labeled just a villa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, its appearance is vastly different compared to the Konohana family’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To describe it in a single word, it was gaudy. Beyond the large gate was a magnificent garden, and the colorful flowers planted there were beautiful even from a distance. People on the street would stop to take a peek. The gate and walls surrounding the mansion were also exquisitely decorated, and it felt like I was admiring a piece of art.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Compared to the Konohana family, it’s a lot flashier…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unconsciously, such words escaped my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Have you seen Konohana-san’s house?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, no, that’s… I’ve been there a few times due to my parents circumstances]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, that’s what you meant]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I almost slipped accidentally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, I live there every day, rather than just visiting it. But I couldn’t let her know that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gate opened and we headed for the mansion, surrounded by several servants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not a speck of dust fell on the wide path. It was well maintained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gorgeous and majestic. That’s the policy of the Tennouji family. Even in the villa, that philosophy stays the same. …This garden here has also even been calculated to look beautiful even from the outside]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Indeed, I think it’s beautiful]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told her that, Tennouji-san smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I entered the mansion. The interior was quite gorgeous, as I expected. There was a  luxurious red carpet and gold and silver ornaments could be seen here and there. However, none of them were overly self-assertive, the light and their placements were well calculated, they all existed as a backdrop in the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if I was looking at a movie set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Mirei! You’re back!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, a male voice came from upstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, father. I’ve returned]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said so, and I quickly straightened my posture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man came down the white spiral staircase. He was a man with an all-back haircut and a dandyish beard. He was large in stature and gave off a powerful impression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I saw that person approaching me, I suddenly became nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Tennouji-san’s… father, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. When I told him I would invite Tomonari-san to my house today, he said he would love to meet you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t prepared for this. I rushed to regain my composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed deeply to Tennouji-san’s father who came up to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I am Tomonari Itsuki, and it’s nice to meet you. I’m always indebted to Tennouji-san at the academy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu. I am Tennouji Masatsugu. Please, make yourself feel at home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The familiarity in his tone relaxed my nerves a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Father. He’s come here today not to deepen friendships, but for a study session]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, of course! Then study to your heart’s content!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san said with a bright smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the next moment, his eyes narrowed and he whispered. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, Tomonari-san. What’s your relationship with my daughter?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh? Uhm, we’re students of the same school…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that really all there is to it? Is there anything fishy about the two of you? Say, a relationship between a man and a woman―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―Father!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san’s voice became sharp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Goodness. …We’re not in such an impure relationship]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, if Mirei says so, then I guess she’s right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu nodded as Tennouji-san said with a blush on her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san may be more humorous than I expected. ―No, I can never be too careful. Even Keigon-san seemed gentle and kind towards his daughter at first. Perhaps Masatsugu-san also has a cold-hearted side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mirei, are you sure you want to study table etiquette?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I’d like a British meal, if possible] (TN: I’m tempted to make a British joke, but I won’t)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san puts his finger on his chin when he hears those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Okay… this is a good opportunity. I’ll join in as well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san said while glancing at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, just having a study session at the Tennouji house is a hurdle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Am I going to be dining with the president of a company that represents the country..?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Masatsugu-san’s suggestion, I was invited directly to the Tennouji family’s dining table.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was supposed to be a study session, but suddenly it became a practical session. I was confused, but Tennouji-san was enthusiastic about it and said [This is better than just practicing] …So I had no choice but to nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7:00 p.m.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I finished the English-style food laid out before me, I wiped my mouth with the inside of my napkin and placed the cutlery on my plate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for the food]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I uttered those words, my tense feelings loosened up a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I didn’t have much time to enjoy the taste of the food. I’m sure they served high-class food, but my mind was too occupied with practicing my etiquette and not letting my nervousness show on my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Fumu]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san, sitting across from me, looked straight at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I’m sure you’ll be fine. At least I didn’t feel uncomfortable having dinner with you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you very much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed as a form of thanks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Father, aren’t you being a little lax in your judgment? He still moved awkwardly when he drank the soup]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying so, Tennouji-san tilts the cup with the tea around her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her graceful movements aren’t easy to imitate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I did notice that you were somewhat nervous… but well, that’s just because I’m the one you’re dealing with! Wahahaha!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san laughed boldly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tension that was building up was eased thanks to his actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I think about it calmly… this might be a good opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a valuable experience to be able to hear the opinions of people in high positions in the upper class, as I did this time. The head of the Konohana family, Keigon-san, is always working at the main residence and is seldom seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since this is a unique opportunity, let’s ask for some advice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umm… Do you have any tips on how to not be nervous in situations like that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I asked Masatsugu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fumu. …I ask you this, do you think there&#8217;s any person who doesn&#8217;t get nervous in situations like this?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu- san asked me back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t answer immediately after that question. At least during this session, Masatsugu-san didn&#8217;t seem nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Perhaps the reason you asked me that question is because I seem to be someone who has no tension whatsoever?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh!? N-no, that&#8217;s not what I meant…] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s the truth?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.That, a little]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wahahaha! Honesty is a virtue!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san laughed happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I was not making fun of Masatsugu-san. I was just asking the question because I admired his confident behavior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I am certainly a man of little to no tension. I can maintain this attitude toward anyone]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Towards anyone, is it…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu. I will not even change my attitude even in front of the prime minister]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word “prime minister” came out of nowhere and I was inwardly astonished. But it&#8217;s no surprise that the head of the Tennouji Group said those words. He would be in a position to dine with them casually if he felt like it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I was surprised to hear that he maintained this attitude even when dealing with the prime minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess he wasn’t joking as Masatsugu-san told me this as a matter of fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But that is only at this moment of time]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No one has this attitude right from the beginning. Even I had a hard time when I was young. I am the way I am right now because I have gained experience from a long period of time]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying this, Masatsugu-san looked at me with a strong will in his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Make achievements. Just do it. …It doesn&#8217;t matter if you fail. It’s what you&#8217;ve done in the past that will help you when the time comes in the future]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words were spoken with dignity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You as well, you must have at least one thing right? Something you’ve accomplished with a strong conviction]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question reminded me of something that happened half a month ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to leave Hinako when I was dismissed from being a caretaker. Then I broke into the Konohana mansion in order to stand next to Hinako once again. That feeling is nothing but conviction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[—Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could indulge myself with an open mind, that it was strange even from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing me like that, Masatsugu-san nodded in satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu, that’s a good look. I’m sure that experience will become an important part of you. I hope you will keep building on that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Masatsugu-san concluded his talk, the servants began to clean the plates from the dining table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, I felt like I understood Masatsugu-san’s greatness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Keigon-san, this person doesn&#8217;t let out a very stern air. But that’s not because he isn&#8217;t stern, but because he doesn&#8217;t need to be stern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu believes that he does not have to go out of his way to be awe-inspiring to not be betrayed by others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He doesn&#8217;t expect the other party to be sincere. Masatsugu-san has struggled so much to get to where he is now that the other party can have nothing but sincerity. He trusts in such a past self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mu] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, I heard the sound of thunder nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san let out a small voice and looked out the window. I followed suit and looked out as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Rain? Since when…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It started raining around the time we started dinner. Tomonari-san seemed so nervous that he didn&#8217;t even notice]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said with dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like she said, I didn&#8217;t notice at all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s a heavy rain warning issued. I heard that the rain was light this morning though…] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san looked at his tablet while saying that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Father…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu. That would be fine]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san and Masatsugu-san were making eye contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san put his tablet on the table, and looked at me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, stay with us for today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Excuse me?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sudden suggestion made me reflexively ask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Me staying… is that okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. It’s rude to let our guests go home in this weather]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said as a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know about that. It’s not hard to understand but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m sorry, I’ll have to discuss it with my house first]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I got up from my seat and called Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Yes. Is something the matter?』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san immediately answered the phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually—]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">「実は――」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained to her that Tennouji-san advised me to stay the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『I see. Well, it is raining like this. I also expected this, to some extent』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the original plan, Shizune-san was supposed to pick me up after the study session. However, Tennouji-san probably felt worried about driving in this rain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Fortunately, tomorrow is a holiday, and we don’t have a problem with the schedule. However, Ojou-sama will be…』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san slurred her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is something wrong with Hinako?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;..It’s not far fetched to think that things are going to be very messy』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, even at lunchtime today, Hinako looked somewhat uneasy and asked [Are you staying over?]. Even though it was unavoidable in an emergency, I feel guilty because I promised to come home and yet I broke it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, I don’t know if this will fix Hinako’s mood but…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going to preface this with an idea to Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually. Today, Tennouji-san’s father… Masatsugu-san, endorsed my table manners. So, if you can make arrangements for tomorrow, if possible…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『&#8230;I understand. I’ll get it ready』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finished the small meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I appreciated the fact that Shizune-san is efficient in her reports and communication.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Anyways, there’s no problem with the arrangements. Please make sure there aren’t any rough edges』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, I hung up the call with Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I headed back toward the dining table where Tennouji-san and the others were waiting for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry to keep you waiting. It seems like it’s all right, so I’ll be in your care today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu! Then let’s get the guest room ready right away!]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san said happily, and the servant beside him quickly moved somewhere. They probably went somewhere to prepare the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have work to do. Tomonari-kun, please relax as you like]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Thank you very much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Masatsugu-san stood up from his seat, I thanked him with as much sincerity as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today was a valuable experience. I’ll make good use of the advice I got from Masatsugu-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, Tomonari-san, let me show you to your guest room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san escorted me to the guest room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennouji family, as they say, is a family of luxury. Not only the front desk, but even the corridors leading to the guest rooms have a luxurious atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This will be Tomonari-san’s room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san opened the door of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the door was a single room about 12 tatami mats wide with a TV and a sofa. This alone is more than enough space to accommodate a person, but apparently there’s even a room in the back as a dedicated bedroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s wide, isn’t it…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Really? I think this is as normal as it gets] (TN: your sense of normal is like the size of my house’s garage) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I’m living at the Konohana mansion, I’m using a room for servants. I’m sure that the Konohana mansion rooms are as spacious as this when it comes to guest rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And don’t forget to bring change of clothes from the closet over there when you use the public bath]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Public bath you mean… eh? I can use the bath?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. I mean, please use it. It’s the pride of our house]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said with confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she insists that much, I’ll use it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, I will be taking a bath first. If you need anything, please contact one of the servants around here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as the door was closed, I let out a gasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;A lot of things happened today, it was full of the unexpected]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you’re wondering, it’s due to the sleepover at a house of a member of the opposite sex, but… the house is so large it doesn’t feel that way. Of course, it makes me nervous in a different way. (TN: 4th wall break?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, did I get anything from it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least it was great to hear Masatsugu-san&#8217;s insightful advice..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, considering that I&#8217;ll continue to work as Hinako’s caretaker, I’ll eventually be invited to someone else’s house like I did this time. This could be considered practice for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I guess I’ll take a bath too]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I needed to calm down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s spend time relaxing in the bath Tennouji-san was so proud of.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed a bathrobe from my room and asked a servant who was waiting a short distance from the guest room to lead me to the large bath. I took off my clothes in the dressing room and opened the door to the bath, feeling a little excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oooh… this is certainly a bath to brag about]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennouji family&#8217;s large bathroom was so gorgeous it&#8217;s hard to believe it wasn’t the main residence. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were two baths as large as the school pool, and even an open-air bath. I had expected the faucet to be a golden lion, but instead, it was a very large and conspicuous statue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The ceiling…. high] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steam, like a cloud, was solidifying near the ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I soaked myself in the bathtub after lightly washing my body, enjoying something I don&#8217;t usually see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haaa… I feel alive again]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that I&#8217;m dead or anything though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I’m alone, I end up muttering these things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, it&#8217;s been a while since I took a bath alone. I had been taking baths with Hinako ever since I became her caretaker, so I was more relaxed today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relaxing bath alone isn&#8217;t bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not bad, but I still feel lonely. I don&#8217;t know, maybe I felt comfortable with Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ara?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I heard a woman’s voice from behind me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so unexpected that I froze completely. Looking closely at the direction of the voice, I noticed a figure standing in the steam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[C-could it be… Tennouji-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes, it is Tennouji-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reply was given in a very composed tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was not the voice of the Tennouji-san I knew. It’s similar, but not quite the same. Her speech also seemed different than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone approached from behind the steam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person was a young woman with her chestnut-colored hair pulled back. Looking at her cheeks dyed red and the water dripping on her fresh skin, I inadvertently diverted my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman however, did not scream or leave, instead she came even closer to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara~, I didn&#8217;t expect to meet you here. Ufufu, it&#8217;s an interesting first meeting]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman, who exuded a calm atmosphere, smiled while covering her mouth with her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You must be Tomonari-san …Nice to meet you. I am Tennouji Hanami, Mirei’s mother. My daughter is always in your care]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… I’m Tomonari Itsuki. Me as well, Tennouji… Mirei-san has always been taking care of me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara, you&#8217;re such a nice and polite child~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was frozen, Hanami-san smiled in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s very young to be the mother of a classmate. She looks to be in her early twenties. And since she&#8217;s taking a bath, she probably removed her makeup as well. So with her experience, it&#8217;s honestly hard to believe that she&#8217;s Tennouji-san’s mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I heard from Mirei that Tomonari-san is a very studious person. So please don&#8217;t only use the guestroom, but also anything in the mansion you like]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-thank you very much…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She praised me and I bowed in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s when I finally came to my senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[—Wait! That’s not the point! This is the men’s bathroom though?!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara? Is that true?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanami-san tilted her head smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is she so calm in front of a naked person?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s true, I think…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara Ara~, that&#8217;s a problem~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m having more problems than you are currently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder if the woman in front of me, who knows this house very well, would ever mistake a men&#8217;s bath for a women&#8217;s bath, let alone me, a guest. I even had the illusion that I was the one who was crazy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure we can find a way to get in together~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My head started to spin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t really understand her sense of distance. Does this person see me as an elementary school student or a child?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puzzled, I heard a girl’s voice from the other side of the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This voice…. Tennouji-san?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fufu, it is me desuwa] (TN: Return of the desuwa!) (EDN: Yatta!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san (real) is here!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank god, maybe she can do something about this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Anyhow, is something wrong? You’ve been making a lot of noises…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently there’s a women’s bath on the other side of the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Tennouji-san’s concerned voice, I tried explaining while looking away from Hanami as much as possible. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, actually—]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[—Ara, Mirei. You’re over there, aren’t you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanami-san said faster before I could explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, it seemed as if time had frozen. Tennouji-san on the other side of the wall also was silent and only the sound of water droplets dripping down the wall could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[M-mother!? What are you doing there!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san seemingly had restarted and shouted in a loud voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　再起動したらしい天王寺さんが、大きな声で言う。</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry~, Mirei. I think I made a mistake again~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-T-this is not a good time! Please leave immediately! I can&#8217;t avoid the black history of seeing my mother naked with a boy from my year!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would indeed be the case…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh~. But this is a good time, I have a lot of things I want to talk about with Tomonari-san~]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mother!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually, why don’t you come here too?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mother!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-san, you have a pretty nice body, don’t you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san no longer responded. (TN: Tennouji.exe stopped responding) (EDN: Attempting to reboot …A fatal error has occurred)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, I heard loud footsteps from the changing room―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―Mother!!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a loud noise, Tennouji-san opened the door to the men’s bath. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my head in that direction―and immediately looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked like she was naked with only a single towel wrapped around her. Unlike Hinako, Tennouji-san was well-developed, and even with a towel wrapped around her, it couldn’t contain everything. I couldn’t look at her. Furthermore, perhaps because she just took a bath, Tennouji-san had her hair down which was different than usual, which made her strangely mature and almost made me fall for her. (TN: FALL FOR HER DAMN IT) (EDN: x2)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[C-Come on! We’ll be out in a minute! M-Mother is a woman, so please have some modesty!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes, it can’t be helped]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Hanami-san stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately tried to close my eyes, but before I did, I noticed that Hanami-san’s reflection at the edge of my vision was not actually naked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[S-swimsuit…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was swimming in the pool just now, so I went straight to the bathroom~. It’s embarrassing to be naked, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanami-san explained too late to the stunned Tennouji-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No but, you may be in a swimsuit, I’m still naked…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Hanami-san looked at Tennouji-san and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[More than that, Mirei. …You’re the one who needs to be more modest, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because she rushed in, she was probably unaware of what she looked like right now. When Tennouji-san lowered her gaze and realized that she was only wearing a towel, her face turned bright red and―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hiyaaaaaaaaa―――!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san’s scream echoed in the spacious bathroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With footsteps even louder than earlier, Tennouji-san swiftly fled the scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ara ara, it’s noisy isn’t it]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Though I think you’re more than half to blame]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a deep sigh as Hanami-san smiled somewhat happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, Tomonari-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Hanami-san looked at me with a serious face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she was wearing a swimsuit, the sight of Hanami-san was still arousing to a healthy male. I turned my head towards Hanami-san and listened to her while averting my gaze slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [Is Mirei having a good time at the academy?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question posed in a serious tone was about Tennouji-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was she concerned about her as a mother? Perhaps Hanami-san just wanted to ask me this question from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded my head… clearly remembering Tennouji-san when we were at the academy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I’m sure that Tennouji-san is always imposing and straightforward in everything… I’m sure she’s having a great time every day]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see. Then that’s good]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanami-san smiled softly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her expression seemed truly relieved from the bottom of her heart.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the ruckus in the bathroom, I went back to the guestroom to study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;And that’s today’s quota, for now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I finished the preparation and review Shizune-san gave me. Since Tennouji-san has been teaching me lately, Shizune-san’s quota was a little more lax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Let’s try just a bit harder]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps because I was studying in an unusual environment, I was able to concentrate well. The right amount of tension seemed to keep me from getting distracted or falling asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got back into it and turned the page of my textbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, a knock came from the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appearing through the open door was Tennouji-san dressed in loungewear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tennouji-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I brewed you a cup of herbal tea, if you’d like to join me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san, holding a tray in one hand, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the two cups on the tray, I received the one in the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steam rising from the cup touched my nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had a calming scent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re really enthusiastic]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked at the materials spread out on my desk and muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not like I’m enthusiastic or anything… I’m always on this kind of schedule, so I just don’t feel comfortable if I’m not studying this much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You still need proof of your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said while sipping her tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think the reason you still don’t feel confident after all that effort is because you haven’t made results that have affirmed your work. …I’m going to make sure you get into the top ranks for next month’s mock exam]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I’ll do my best]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san also told me that I should make an achievement. Certainly, being a top scorer at Kiou Academy would be a great achievement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was full of motivation, and at the same time I had respect for Tennouji-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure that Tennouji-san acts with such things in mind on a regular basis. Her usual imposing appearance didn’t come from nothing. Her hard work up until now must’ve created her daily attitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I looked at Tennouji-san and… her appearance looked different than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is something wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it’s just… I’ve never seen your hair down before]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, come to think of it, certainly. It’s not often that I put it down at the academy, and… I just finished bathing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, I saw her with her hair down when she rushed out of the bathroom, but at the same time I immediately looked away because of her “clothes”, or lack thereof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at her again, with her hair down, Tennouji-san looks more mature than usual. Unlike her usual looks, where her strong will is very apparent, she seemed more calm here. The gap between the two is quite interesting, and it makes my eyes glued to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Haha~. Could it be… you were fascinated by me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said with a grin followed by a nasty smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was stumped upon hearing that and I couldn’t respond. I wanted to deny it, but it’d be far too late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Unlike Tennouji-san, I’m not used to this kind of situation]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked away and uttered the words a sore loser would say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s… the same here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I was, just trying to be strong. …I know, even I get a little surprised. It’s the first time I’ve had someone of the opposite sex stay at my house, and… there’s also that incident in the bath]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san’s were flushed red while she was talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I involuntarily gulped my saliva at the sight of her embarrassed self like that of a maiden, which I couldn’t imagine from her usual self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―It was no good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The atmosphere was somehow very awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An unfamiliar tension washed over me. I was more restless now than I was when I had dinner with Masatsugu-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind went blank, and that’s when I saw the herbal tea on my desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s drink this and calm down. I thought to myself, and tilted the cup to my mouth when―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hoot―!?](TN: Owl?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of my hasty attempt to drink, I complained with a burning pain on my tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Are you okay!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san was in a panic and worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not so bad that it burned. However, my tongue wasn’t moving properly, so I tried to tell her that I was fine with a simple glance, but then my eyes met Tennouji-san’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both looked into each other&#8217;s eyes and looked away quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awkward atmosphere slowly fizzled out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geez… I haven’t felt like this in a long time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san says with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If I think about it carefully, you’ve been stuck in my mind since the first day we met. You knew the Konohana Group, but not the Tennouji Group… and you said delusional things like my hair was dyed]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I’m still wondering about that though…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Be quiet]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was told to keep my mouth shut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Masatsugu-san nor Hanami-san had blonde hair. Considering the general characteristics of Japanese people, it’s likely that Tennouji-san dyed her hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not often that I get a chance to say this, so I’ll tell you now…. I’m grateful to you. Since I met you, my student life has been enriched by tea parties, study groups, and more]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tone of voice conveyed her gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a fascinating smile, Tennouji-san continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And since you seem to have more than you look, you motivate me when I’m around you. …If you can score in the top single digits on the next mock exam, I’ll recruit you to be my right hand man after graduation] (TN: Are you sure you don’t mean husband?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… as expected, a bit of a long shot, isn’t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you’re feeling weak right now, it certainly does seem like it is]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san joked as I laughed bitterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, working with Tennouji-san sounds like a lot of fun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I voiced my thoughts, Tennouji-san looked surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. I’ve been enjoying studying these days thanks to Tennouji-san, so I’d like to thank you for your help, and I wish I could do my job this way, too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no idea what the future holds, but if I work as Tennouji-san&#8217;s subordinate, I believe I can live happily. I have a lot of experience as a part-timer, so I know what I&#8217;m talking about. I’m sure that Tennouji-san will be a good boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[F-fufufu..!! Of course! Of course! If you follow me, I guarantee you’ll live a fulfilling life!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san said passionately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps due to her happiness, her cheeks were slightly blushing and her eyes sparkled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-well, the reality is that in order for Tomonari-san to work for me, he has to pass the Tennouji Group’s employment exam…. No, but if only he could get a recommendation from the Academy… Or perhaps you’d like to become my fiance, which would guarantee you the position of secretary…] (TN: SHE IS ASKING FOR A HUSBAND)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fiance?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-n-nothing! I-ignore that, it’s just, I’m thinking a little too far in the future!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at Tennouji-san’s flustered response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Anyways, I’ve overstayed my welcome]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san looked at her watch and muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, last but not least, let’s decide on our slogan!] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Slogan, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Since ancient times, in times of war, there have been words to boost the morale of the corps—A battle cry. [Ei! Ei! Hoo!] and [The enemy is at Honno-ji] are the most famous] (TN: The enemy is at Honno-ji is a quote said during the warring times of Japan from what&#8217;s known the Honno-ji incident, google for more info) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see, so that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ei! Ei! Ho! Tennouji-san looked a bit cute when she said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, please repeat after me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I nodded, Tennouji-san opened her eyes with a chuckle and said our slogan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Beat Konohana Hinako!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Beat Konohana――Eh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, but… are you going with that slogan?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes! Isn’t it perfect for us!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I say that, I’ll be fired from my current job…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I have no choice. I can&#8217;t explain the situation, so I’ll just have to play along here.           </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, let&#8217;s try again]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennouji-san took a quick breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Beat Konohana Hinako!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[B-beat Konohana Hinako!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry, Hinako.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next morning, after finishing breakfast at the Tennouji mansion, I was greeted by a black car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, thank you for your help]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed deeply to Masatsugu-san and Tennouji-san, who went out of their way to see me off. Hanami-san had to go to work, so she did not come out, but we exchanged a brief greeting before leaving the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You are always welcome to visit us again]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu! I’ll be waiting for you!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get in the car as the two see me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, this car was provided by the Konohana family. Tennouji-san and the others must think that I’m going back to my house, but in truth, I’m heading back to the Konohana family&#8217;s mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The driver said [Let’s be off], and the car left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san isn&#8217;t accompanying us this time because Tennouji-san may remember her face as a maid of the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still… It was worthwhile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will thank Tennouji-san again later. I thought as I looked out the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After watching his guest get into the car and leave, Masatsugu looked at Mirei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mirei. Are you on good terms with him?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. We’re in different classes, but we get along well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei affirmed her father’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Besides… Tomonari-san has been a big help to me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei recalled last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prestige of the Tennouji family is strong. For this reason, even at the academy, although she was often respected, she was not blessed with many opportunities to talk and laugh side by side with others due to her position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Itsuki who changed that. Itsuki invited Mirei to tea parties and study groups. He also gave her a chance to Konohana Hinako, whom she considered as a rival, but also as someone whom she hoped to interact with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent study group also originated from Itsuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the study group, Mirei’s grades improved and she was able to make good friends. Nowadays, Itsuki is showing that he&#8217;s not too stuck up about Mirei, but Mirei also feels great gratitude to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover&#8211;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Working with Tennouji-san sounds like a lot of fun』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t expect him to say something so pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei, who always seems confident, is not entirely free from anxiety about the future. Her rivalry with Hinako is also an expression of her fear that if she loses to her at the institute, she may continue to lose in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why she was happy to hear Itsuki’s words last night. (EDN: Won the battle, lost the war)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While maintaining a resolute attitude, Itsuki located and wiped away the insecurities she had hidden deep in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I too… I feel like I can get through any job if Tomonari-san is with me) (TN: And just like that, she fell)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Mirei was lost in her own thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san stroked his beard with his fingers, letting out a small [Umu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it a man-woman relationship?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Heeea!? I-I told you already, it&#8217;s nothing like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei’s face turned red and she denied it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking that it was just a joke, Mirei’s lips twitched and muttered [Geez]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu. …Then that&#8217;s fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu nodded with a serious face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Actually there’s something I need to discuss with Mirei. …Maybe it&#8217;s time for you to have a fiance]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an abrupt proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei was surprised and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[F-Fiance… is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Umu. I had been considering it for some time, but I didn&#8217;t tell you much because I thought it was too early. But the other day I had the opportunity to speak with a representative of the Konohana family at a social function. At that time, the topic of their daughter&#8217;s engagement came up, and it seems that they are actively considering it over there. They say it is a measure to keep bad bugs away from their daughter]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a serious expression, Masatsugu continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Many people will try to get close to you in the future, seeking the prestige of the Tennouji family. Some of them, of course, will approach you with malicious intent. Considering such a future, I think the Konohana family has a point. I still think it&#8217;s too early to tell, but I decided that if &#8230;&#8230; you are willing to go along with it, then it&#8217;s fine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, the news is not that the fiance has been chosen for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as she was being raised as the daughter of the Tennouji group, she thought that one day she would be engaged to someone. However, Mirei remembers that this was scheduled for a little later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Mirei, however, it&#8217;s not the timing that&#8217;s important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The important thing is―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[For the Tennouji family… is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some reason, her voice trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if to drown out the weak sound of his earlier voice, Mirei asked her father again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Will I be able to contribute to the Tennouji family by getting engaged?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Umu. Well the plan would be easier that way]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the upper class, engagements can be used to strengthen existing connections. If they are engaged to the son of a company they know well, future business transactions will go more smoothly than ever before. If the engagement is to a future family member, the risk of discord between companies is relatively easy to avoid, making it easier to develop large-scale talks such as acquisitions or mergers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s if you are willing, of course―]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mirei was as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She answered with an unclouded and regal smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―I accept]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’ve returned]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I arrived at the Konohana family mansion, I was greeted by Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I just got back. …Sorry I had to suddenly stay out yesterday]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s no longer a problem. It’s not about the past, it&#8217;s about the present]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said this as if we were currently facing a problem…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please put the Ojou-sama in a good mood immediately. Ojou-sama is losing her temper]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh? Temper?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at Shizune-san, who looked very troubled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought she might be in a bad mood, but I didn&#8217;t expect her to lose her temper. However, it is hard to imagine Hinako in a temper tantrum. I don&#8217;t think Hinako would throw a tantrum, though&#8230;&#8230;.(EN: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">my life is a lie, I always call it a tamper tantrum in my head) (TN: You can’t be serious)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I headed to Hinako&#8217;s room and took a deep breath in front of the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I knocked on the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, can I come in?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the other side of the door, I heard a grumpy voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sounded like she was in a bad mood. Fearfully, I opened the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was on the bed, lying down and wrapped in a blanket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I entered the room, she moved her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Welcome back, Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-yeah. I’m back―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki the liar]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said as if to interrupt my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing Hinako angry for the first time, I stiffened and stood in place with my mouth open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You said it was a day trip though…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that… It was an emergency…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Return at morning]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You returned at morning]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, you know, if I return by morning, it’s a morning trip home….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please don’t say it that way, because it might be misunderstood in a strange way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should I explain it again to show how sincere I am?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhhh, now then. At first, it really was going to be a day trip. But the weather broke last night…. Hinako knew there was thunder last night, right? That’s  why I stayed at Tennouji-san’s house, it was unavoidable…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I explained, dripping in cold sweat, Hinako continued to stare at me in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always hard to read her expressions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[D-did you get it…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nnn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako gave me a small nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thanks for making long excuses] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She really did lose her temper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Come]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Come here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a grim look on her face, Hinako patted the bed. She wanted me to sit next to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I approached the bed, Hinako suddenly buried her face in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[O-Oi? Hinako?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Smell]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako murmured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not Itsuki’s smell. …I’m restless]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you mean by my smell…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, when I first met Hinako, I think she told me that I smelled good. Could it be that Hinako has a keen sense of smell?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did you have dinner with Tennouji-san…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well, I did]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did you take a bath at Tennouji-san’s house…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I did, but..]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The food and bath are natural since I stayed the night there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did you take a bath with Tennouji-san…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that obviously didn’t happ―]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I was about to deny it instantly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my mind, the image of Tennouji-san wearing only a towel passed through my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―a] (TN: Gura dat u?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My voice cut off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;e?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, no, that…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What did you just say…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think I can escape anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I honestly spoke about the whole bathroom incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu! Muuuuu!!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, Hinako’s face turned red and she got angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You told me that you wouldn’t…!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Accident! It was an accident! It’s not like we went in together, it’s more like we happened to be in the same place!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I explained properly, but she was clearly not convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You ate with Tennouji-san, you took a bath with Tennouji-san…. You did the same thing with me..! Itsuki is…. Tennouji-san’s caretaker!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I’m not! I’m Hinako’s caretaker!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, there’s no way I would do the same thing to Tennouji-san that I did to Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ate together, but I didn’t feed her. We took a bath together (somewhat), but I didn’t wash her hair like Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If so..!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako grabbed my sleeve and pulled me closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If so… Itsuki should be by my side more than anyone else…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a little surprised by Hinako’s instant mood swing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe I made her uneasy. Did she think I would leave her to work for Tennouji-san? ―There’s no way that’d happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s okay. Even I know that much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu… I’m telling you because you don’t]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I do though]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after I made it clear, the door opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Excuse me. Ojou-sama, lunch is ready]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san announced while bowing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Hinako, who was in a bad mood, couldn&#8217;t overcome her hunger, and she got off the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as Hinako arrived at the dining room, a servant pulled out a chair. Hinako sat down in the chair with familiarity and placed her napkin on her lap. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I watched the scene―I pulled up a seat in front of Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[May I sit in front of you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako opened her eyes when she saw me following her to the dining room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, Hinako had been eating alone. That’s why she was surprised to see me around even though it was lunch time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san will be dining with us today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san’s words made Hinako even more surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san looks at me. It looks like I’ll be the one explaining from here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not allowed to eat with Hinako until I master table manners. That’s what we agreed on. …That’s why I learned table manners from Tennouji-san. That, in turn, has made results, so we can eat together today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I explained the situation, Shizune-san nodded and added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Lastly, I would like to check Itsuki-san’s manners with my own eyes. …The lunch menu today is more like a dinner menu. If it’s alright with you, he may eat lunch and dinner with Ojou-sama from now on]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, it’s a final test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the looks of it, today’s lunch is Italian. The multiple items on the menu are more like a dinner menu. But, it’s not as complicated as a course meal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Hinako is the daughter of the Konohana Group, she doesn’t eat a full course every day. Even so, there’s at least some manners that should be observed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san stared at me intently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know. ―I’m not going to let up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat in a chair from the left side of the room. There was a napkin on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I folded the napkin in two, then laid it on my lap with the folded side facing me. When wiping the mouth, it’s good manners to use the inside. It should be noted that using a handkerchief or tissue would be a breach of etiquette. If napkins are provided and a personal handkerchief is used, it would be an indication that [I don&#8217;t want to use this napkin]. (TN: I’ll be completely honest all this table manners are killing me)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cutlery is used from the outside. There are two knives and two spoons on the right and three forks on the left. The order of the meal is appetizers, soup, fish, and meat. The absence of forks on the right indicates that pasta is not included on today’s menu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use knives and forks with a soft grip and be careful not to make noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After eating the carpaccio appetizer, I quietly drank the soup. Soup is supposed to be sipped with a spoon. You shouldn’t put your mouth to the cup, but when the amount is getting low, there’s no problem tilting the cup gently and scoop it with a soup. (TN: Carpaccio is a dish of meat or fish, thinly sliced or pounded thin, and served raw, typically as an appetizer.) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After taking a bit of grilled sea bream, which was in season, Shizune-san gave a small nod and turned away from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess… that would mean a pass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a small exhale of relief and saw Hinako sitting in front of me looking surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… is awesome and improving…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I tried my best]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, maybe what I lacked was confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Masatsugu-san said he had dinner with me and felt no discomfort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, at that point I had the bare minimum of necessary knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still felt insecure and freaked out the whole time because I had no confidence in myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last thing I needed to grasp to learn manners―was confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If it’s okay with Hinako, I’d like to have dinner with you as much as possible in the future, is that okay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel a little embarrassed to say that now, and it makes me feel weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she rejected me for this, it would surely leave a big mark in my life. …But it seemed like my concerns were unfounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako put on a big smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to be in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then… from here on, Itsuki will also be having breakfast…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I tilted my head at her words, Hinako instantly slacked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuuー&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resting her chin on the table, Hinako let out a disheveled sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhh, Shizune-san. I thought we’re supposed to eat with good manners…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s no such rule. However, since Keigon-sama sometimes appears at dinner, if Itsuki-san’s manners aren’t good enough at that time, you will leave a bad impression]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s the real reason…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, the reason Shizune-san wanted me to learn table manners was so that I didn’t make a bad impression on Keigon-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san was taking care not to put me in a bad position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… over here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako tapped the chair next to her and urged me to sit there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I sat down in the seat next to her, as I was told to, Hinako smiled softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s eat together…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked younger than usual, with a relaxed expression. It was proof that Hinako was her natural self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded with a short [Yeah] and then had lunch with Hinako once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s thanks to Tennouji-san I was able to see this smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be sure to thank her on Monday.</span></p>
