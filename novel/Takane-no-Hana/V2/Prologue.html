<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two days after the Konohana social gathering was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday morning, I woke up and remembered that I was in the Konohana family mansion.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s right. I guess I’m still her caretaker]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a dream. It was just last week… when I infiltrated this mansion alone to help Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, I wonder how I could’ve done something so bold. That’s how wrong I thought Keigon-san’s way was at the time, and that’s how much I wanted to help Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[All right, let’s keep doing our best today]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed into my school uniform and attended the servants meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I went to Hinako’s room as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You’re sleeping well]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn, muuu….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who kicked off her futon and was sleeping with her navel hanging out, let out a small mumble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this happy sleeping face made me realize that I was now part of a warm daily life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I can’t just sit back and relax.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I shook Hinako’s sleeping body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, it’s morning]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nuuu… Itsuki?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room’s curtains were opened to let the sunlight in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who raised her body up, rubbed her eyes sleepily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Good morning]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to Hinako to exchange greetings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the brightly lit room, Hinako yawned loudly and sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[School… I don’t want to go]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t be selfish]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acting may be hard work, but attending school is important .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want Hinako to eventually go to school on her own. And that’s my mission as her caretaker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I must not forget that I was almost dismissed as a caretaker. (TN: Technically he was dismissed) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to prepare myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While thinking about this, I suddenly focused my attention on Hinako’s mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako, look up for a second]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnn…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked up at me curiously, and I brought something I took out of my pocket closer to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s that?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a handkerchief. You’re drooling, so I thought I’d wipe it off]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[D-Drool…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako repeated my words, as if she didn’t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, Hinako turned her face downwards, looking panicked. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong? You suddenly looked down]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I’ll wipe it off myself… don’t… look at me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing a handkerchief on her palm, Hinako immediately wiped her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure that we were both used to me wiping drool off her face, but… I wonder what’s going on today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I brought you a change of clothes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nnn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako shook her little head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waking up Hinako, the next step is to help her get dressed. At first, the sight of it was very stimulating and made my head spin, but recently I’ve been able to keep my reasoning intact, and my thoughts on it had disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Get out]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come on, get out]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, holding her change of clothes in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those words were incredibly shocking to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;&#8230;Eh?] (TN: Itsuki.exe has stopped working) (EDN: Rebooting… Rebooting failed)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako pushed me out of the room, her face flushed red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I heard the sound of door slamming shut behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hmm]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was very out of character for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Hinako’s been acting strangely since the day of the social party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strictly speaking, her attitude towards me is different than before. She was more open and honest in the past. …what made her change?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can we get back to normal after a while…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After ten minutes of waiting, Hinako came out of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, she didn’t dress up well, so I ended up helping her. The buttons on her shirt were misbuttoned and the zipper of her skirt was stuck through the fabric. What was unusual was that Hinako kept looking away in embarrassment while I was fixing them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leading Hinako to the dining room, I went to my room to get my bag and my textbooks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way there, I came face to face with Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-san. Did something happen between you and Ojou-sama?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I don’t think anything happened…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had to say something, I’d just say Hinako was acting weird, but not that there was anything wrong with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama said that from tomorrow on, she doesn’t want to be woken up by Itsuki-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh..?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let me ask you again. Did something happen?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stared at me as if I was a criminal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to clear up that misunderstanding, so I explained to her about Hinako’s behavior after the social gathering. If I tell Shizune-san, she might be able to get some hints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama’s behavior is weird, is it…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um. D-Did I do something to make Hinako dislike me?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, rather, the other day, I found out that Ojou-sama is quite fond of Itsuki-san…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was both happy and embarrassed to hear that.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think she’s sick, but I will keep an eye on her. Please report back to me if you learn anything]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left Shizune-san and headed to the dining room where Hinako was. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was time to head out to school.</span></p>
