<h3>Chapter 2 - Kiou Academy.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day, I put on the black school uniform of Kiou Academy and walked out of the mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last night, I ended up having Shizune-san carry Hinako-sama for me. My phone was taken and was in her pocket, so I took it back from her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A black lacquered car was parked in front of the gate. In front of it, Hinako-sama could be seen complaining to Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I want to go home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you say that in eight hours, I will allow you to]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako-sama was being calmed down by Shizune-san, who was very used to the situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-sama, please come this way]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san looked at me and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, from now on, I’m the heir apparent of a medium-sized company. When Shizune-san called me by “sama”, I realized that my ostensible identity had already been changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, Itsuki-sama. Which seat would you like to sit in?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I’m about to get into the car, Shizune-san asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was this&#8230; A review of yesterday&#8217;s etiquette class I took?　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Backseat, behind the passenger seat]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Correct. If there is a driver, the person with the higher position sits behind the driver’s seat, behind the the passenger seat, in the center of the back seat, and in the passenger seat, in that order] (TN: This is some sort of seating etiquette high society people have, you can try googling it. And if anyone knows if this is correct or not, pls let me know in the comments or discord)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If the driver is your companion, the passenger seat will be the highest seat, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. You studied well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was given an unimaginable Spartan education&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Originally, it’s supposed to be the caretaker’s job to get Ojou-sama into the car, but I will demonstrate for you step by step. Now please get into the car]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako-sama entered the car, followed by me entering the back seat. Shizune-san sat in the passenger seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sleepy~~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve been sleeping a lot, haven’t you?” &#8230;I managed to prevent myself from saying that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car started to slow down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since the two of you are set to live in a different house, we will drop you off shortly before the academy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So it will be just the two of us walking down the street to school? Won’t we get kidnapped like yesterday?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t worry. We have a perimeter around Ojou-sama at all times… The incident the other day happened because Ojou-sama went out without letting us know. You, as her caretaker, should prevent such things from happening]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Understood]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today is my first day of work. As a caretaker I’ll have to be paying close attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, I’m in the same class as Hinako&#8230;-sama, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. As her caretaker, you will be with her at all times]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Hinako-sama and I will be classmates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki&#8230; What’s with your tone?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did she hear that…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in front of Shizune-san, it’s hard to not call her Hinako-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune. Itsuki’s tone, make it go back]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, Ojou-sama. That would not set a good example for others]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then&#8230; Just when we’re alone and when Shizune is around]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reluctantly, Shizune-san complied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good, Itsuki&#8230; I can talk to you normally now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not exactly happy&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san’s gaze was painful. In fact, I don’t mind using honorifics. I’ve spent my whole life working part-time, so I’m used to having a hierarchical relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-sama, please always use polite language when in the academy to avoid any faults. Being the heir to a medium-sized company is a rather low status in the Kiou Academy, so it would be better if you could change your tone to avoid unnecessary tensions]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On paper, I’m the son of the heir of a medium-sized company and I have a low status&#8230; It seems like I’ll be using honorifics in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Aahhhh~~ The academy is getting closer~~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said lazily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Carry me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car jolted violently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are you talking about all of a sudden, Ojou-sama? The driver seems to be surprised as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama. That is, without a doubt, an unladylike behavior]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey Itsuki, you smell good, you know&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Oh, really?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san rolled her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki-sama. May I have a sniff for future reference?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No&#8230; I don’t think I smell good at all. Please don’t do this to me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You do though]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said that, Hinako put her nose close to my sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just in case, I’ll smell myself&#8230; Nope, I don’t smell anything. If I had to guess, it would smell like the flower detergent used at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, Hinako-sama. I’m also a man, so I don’t think getting close to me is&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tone]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good~~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems whatever I say is useless against her.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a sigh, and Shizune-san let out an even bigger sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama. It’s time&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approximately 30 minutes later, the car arrived at its destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a quiet alley, me and Hinako were dropped off. It seemed like there was no one around&#8230; but there were a lot of the Konohana family guards lurking if you looked closely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki-sama. I’ll give you this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san handed me a black sack with no visible content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If Ojou-sama isn’t being reasonable, use this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I gave a vague [Huh&#8230;] in response to her instructions, not exactly understanding what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Have a good day then]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying thank you to Shizune-san, who thanked me back, we started to walk to the Academy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I want to go home]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shouldn’t you be acting?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No one has seen me yet… So I can relax]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems Hinako can sense people’s gazes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what she says but, as her caretaker, I have to protect the appearance of her in public. As we’re heading to the academy, I looked around carefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Big]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help but mutter to myself as I stood in front of the majestic, mansion-like study hall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a prestigious school that refers to Japan’s unyielding power, the Kiou Academy. The name might sound stupid, but it’s a very good educational institution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hesitated to take a step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next to me was&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning, Konohana-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good morning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A girl with amber hair was answering the greetings of students on the street in a disciplined manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san&#8230; as always, she’s so pretty]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Very noble&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard comments like that everywhere around us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a peek at Hinako’s profile, who started acting before I knew it. She was different from a few moments ago. I couldn’t believe the girl with an intelligent and decent behavior was the same person who drooled on my bed last night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong, friend of mine?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whoa!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at me concerningly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was very startled. I rushed to cover my mouth and told her it’s nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we entered the school building, we went to the staff room first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Hinako and I are the same age. So we naturally belonged to the same grade without having to lie about our age. And Shizune-san also made sure that we were in the same class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We’ve been expecting you. You must be Itsuki Tomonari]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we entered the staff room, we were greeted by a female teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My name is Misono Fukushima. I will be the homeroom teacher for Class 2A, pleased to meet you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Pleased to meet you too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed my head slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, do you know Konohana-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, that&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t come up with a lie, and stagnated for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Hinako, who was next to me, spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My family and Tomonari-kun’s family are close, so we have been in contact for a long time. Because of that, I decided to show him around the school]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hinako explained politely, the teacher nodded in agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, it’s very luxurious to be guided by Konohan-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha&#8230; I guess so]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sensei, did you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako tends to get lost in the academy when she’s alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We have a transfer student coming to our class today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fukushima-sensei, who entered the classroom before me, informed the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I went into the classroom and greeted everyone while standing in front of the blackboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m Tomonari Itsuki. Nice to meet you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no clapping and such, but the gazes and expressions from everyone were friendly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school I&#8217;ve been going to up until now has never had a transfer student before, so if one came it should have livened up the mood by itself but&#8230; There&#8217;s no sign of that happening with this class&#8217;s students. They had matured somewhere, and a tolerant atmosphere was being created.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun, please use that open seat over there. &#8230;Everyone, I understand you are interested in the transfer student, but class comes first. Please redirect your feelings, ok?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher, standing at the podium, looked around the classroom and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a seat in the back, in the second row from the window, and quickly pulled out my textbook from my bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first period was math.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now, let’s begin the lesson. This time, we’ll study the Commutative Integral Method]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pretty sure that this was taught in the 3rd grade at my old high school&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it looked like it was something you learned in the spring of your second year at Kiou Academy.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s it for the first period. Don’t forget to review, everyone]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fukushima-sensei said as soon as the chime rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After bowing to the teacher, the students got a break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I should thank Shizune-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I managed to keep up&#8230; but the content was still very difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it was only the end of the first period, I felt as if I studied the whole day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well then&#8230; What is Ojou-sama doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remembering my mission as a caretaker, I checked Hinako’s condition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san. There’s something I don’t understand in the class just now…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you’re fine with me, I’ll be glad to help]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she is in public, she has the mask of “A Perfect Young Lady”. So far, there’s been no signs of that falling off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, new guy!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was suddenly approached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, there was a male student with a large figure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, even though you’re a newcomer, not giving me a hello is cheeky. Give me your tribute]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know if that was a joke or if he was serious… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ouch!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was confused, a female student came and gave a chop to the male student’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re scaring Tomonari-kun!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I’m sorry. I was just kidding!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The male student said while holding his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It was Tomonari Itsuki-kun, right? I’m Taishou Katsuya]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m Asahi Karen. Let’s get along~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both of them were busy introducing themselves, I interjected with a cough.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems what he said about tributes and such was a joke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari. You were having a hard time keeping up with the class earlier, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Why do you think so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hahaha! It’s okay. It happens to all the transfer students]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Transfer students… is there anyone other than me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not exactly at the same time, but it isn’t uncommon for students to transfer in. You also got transferred at this time of year due to family reasons, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, that’s about right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that the students were also aware that this was a special school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But I’ve never heard of the Tomonari family. What does your family do?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We’re in the IT Business. We’re not exactly big&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered Asahi-san’s question, remembering the setting Shizune-san created for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My family owns an IT company in the middle of nowhere, and I’m a candidate to become its heir apparent.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Asahi-san and Taishou-san heard my answer, they looked at each other and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I knew what to expect since I saw you having it tough earlier&#8230; Tomonari-kun, you’ve been living more like a commoner, right?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes, but&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san smiled teasingly at me, and I tried to nod in approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There are 2 types of transfer students. One is when someone has already studied hard enough in other schools and comes here for more experience. On the other hand, there are those who didn’t study much originally, but due to family reasons, they were forced to enroll here. In the former case, most of the students come from relatively wealthy families, while in the latter, most of them have commoner origins]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But for those who have spent most of their time in normal schools, it can be hard to keep up with the curriculum of this school. That’s why we have a group of students with similar backgrounds to support them. I think we can help Tomonari-kun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After listening to their explanation, I nodded my head. In short, they were going to teach me a lot of things as a newcomer, someone with a more common background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good thing that the students of the academy are such kind human beings&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much. That helps]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No need for honorifics. We’re classmates]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I have to talk this way for family reasons]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh&#8230; Well, guess it can’t be helped. It happens all the time]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my mind, I’ve already called him Taishou.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">20.000 Yen a day, lodging provided, 3 meals a day. And for that, I play the role of an heir apparent.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, Tomonari, I have a question]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taishou said with a slight mystical look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You&#8230; What’s your relationship with Konohana-san?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment the question was asked.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air in the classroom seemed to freeze with a snapping sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What..?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, I thought I was on an execution ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Today, didn’t you come to school with her?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ahh… Konohana-san and I have met before through our parents&#8217; connection, so we sort of knew each other already. And so I just asked her to give me a tour around the academy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that really all?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s all, really&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you guys not mutual fiancés or something?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fiancé&#8230; It’s not like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, a commoner, a fiancé is an urban legend.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I shrugged my shoulders, Taisho shuddered and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What the hell, you scared me!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whoa!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He slapped my shoulder, and I let out a squeal.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered about Taishou, who had suddenly become more friendly. The tension that was present before has calmed down, and my classmates were once again chatting peacefully.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well~, that was an intense moment]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What do you mean, Asahi-san..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sure you’ve heard things about her. In addition to being the daughter of the Konohana Group, she has the best grades in the school and also has the looks to compliment it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and urged her to continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But Konohana-san has never been in a relationship before. That’s why we wondered if she had a fiancé outside of the academy&#8230; Today, Tomonari-kun came to the academy with Konohana-san. “Is that Konohana-san’s Fiancé!?”, is what everyone was thinking]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see. Fiancés do exist huh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t have one though. But if you’re from a family like the Konohana’s, it wouldn’t be surprising if you have one]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I haven’t heard whether Hinako has a fiancé or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also feel like since she&#8217;s in the process she doesn&#8217;t have one but&#8230; no, she might be worrying because she has one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, I’ve never had a fiancé. In the future, if Tomonari meets a cute and lovely girl, please introduce me to her]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll do my best]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I laughed it off and let the conversation flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking to Taishou-san and Asahi-san, I was a little relieved. I was wondering what would happen when I decided to enroll in Kiou Academy&#8230; But I think I will be able to do better than anticipated.　</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as the academy was about to start lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun. What are you going to do at lunch?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We are planning to go to the cafeteria&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho and Asahi-san approached me as I was putting my books away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry. I have some things to attend to…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Things?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained to Taisho, who tilted his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m supposed to keep in touch with my parents during lunch break. That’s why I’ll just eat my bento] (TN: Bento is a lunch box in Japanese, I used it cuz it’s shorter and it’s nice to learn new words) (PR: If you don’t know what a bento is I’ll bonk you)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so&#8230; Tomonari-kun’s parents are rather overprotective]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was another setting Shizune-san thought of. When I first heard of this setting, I thought “Will they really believe this&#8230;?”, and sure enough, both of them had faces that said it was a pity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Come to think of it, Konohana-san is also like that, isn’t she? She always goes somewhere during lunch break]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh&#8230; Rumor has it, she helps out her family business on lunch break. I heard she’s on a conference call or something]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I listened to their conversation, I caught a glimpse of Hinako, sitting in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san. If you don’t mind, would you like to come to the cafeteria with us?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m terribly sorry. I have some work to do at lunch&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Is that so, well then. Sorry for bothering you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After politely declining her classmate’s invitation, Hinako took her bento out of her bag and left the classroom.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing this, I pulled out my chair and stood up too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well then, see you later]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tell us if you ever want to go to the cafeteria~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I left them, I went out and immediately looked for Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was walking alone down the corridor. I followed her while maintaining a certain distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako had been called out many times as she was walking near the classrooms, but by the time she passed through the corridor, the sights from people around her had decreased.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the garden is an old student hall. The building is no longer in use due to old age and deterioration. However, considering the academy’s reputation, the building is regularly cleaned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I went up the stairs of the building to the roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making sure no one was around, I opened the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good work~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako sits down on the floor and greets me with a relaxed expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tone]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down next to Hinako, giving her a proper greeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You always have lunch here, don’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. There’s no one here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As her caretaker, I have to be by Hinako’s side at all times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From now on, I’ll probably be spending my lunch here every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How’s the academy..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It really is a prestigious school, huh. I thought I’d done a lot of prep yesterday, but I’m still having a hard time keeping up with the class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Good luck with that… If your grades are bad, you might be dismissed from being a caretaker]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s not good]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I hadn’t met Hinako, I would’ve lost my house and wouldn’t be able to go to school. I am in a very fortunate environment right now. I have to do my best not to get kicked out of this environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The bentos, should we eat?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the lid of the bento with Hinako. The bento, prepared by the servants of the Konohana family, was an extravagant one with plenty of rare ingredients.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s amazing&#8230; I’ve never seen such a high quality bento]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nnn. But the food at the cafeteria is much more sumptuous.] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so&#8230; You don’t eat at the cafeteria?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a pain in the arse, having to worry about people’s gaze]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess she doesn’t like the celebrity-like attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And&#8230; If it’s a bento, it’s all my favorite food]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are there foods you don’t like? Such as?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Carrots, green peppers, green peas, Shiitake mushrooms, dried plums, tomatoes, pumpkins&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oi. You just don’t like vegetables&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve been found out~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said with a sly smile on her face.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a completely different aura compared to when we’re in the classroom. If Taisho or Asahi-san saw this, they might be so surprised that their hearts would jump out of their chests. (TN: This might be a Japanese joke I’m not getting, pls anyone tell me if you have any information)　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stretched out her chopsticks and began eating her bento.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the food was spilling all over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s spilling]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, don’t “Nn” me&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now&#8230; I understand the significance of a caretaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was more like nursing her rather than looking over her. For some reason, Hinako is able to behave flawlessly in front of the public, but other than that, she can’t do anything. Speaking of which, when we were kidnapped, she spilled her PET bottle drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Feed me~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako opens her mouth as she holds out her bento.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be a shame to have her bento spilled all over her. There’s no one else around&#8230; Oh well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I picked up a side dish at random and brought it to Hinako’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm&#8230; It doesn’t matter]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said, looking satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why don’t you eat too, Itsuki?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, right]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Hinako’s suggestion, I reach for my own bento with my chopsticks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I decided to try the standard Dashimaki Tamago. (TN: Dashimaki Tamago is a traditional Japanese omelette, made by rolling thin layers of egg in the frypan)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whoa! What is this!? It’s so good~!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once I moved my chopsticks, I couldn’t stop til the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meat, the fish, the salads, everything was amazingly delicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Which one is your favorite?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My favorite?&#8230; All of them are good, but if I had to say, I’d say the first one I tasted, the Dashimaki Tamago]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, I’ll give it to you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Returning the favor. Ahnn~] (TN: SFX for mouth opening in Japanese, just in case one of you guys misunderstood)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako grabbed a Dashimaki Tamago with her chopsticks and brought it to my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt embarrassed and hesitated when I was doing it, but there was no sign of that when Hinako did it to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to open my mouth and eat the Dashimaki Tamago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is it delicious?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s delicious, but is it okay to give it to me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m Itsuki’s master. I have to feed him]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Feeding is&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’d be in trouble if your love for me fades out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her voice sounded just a little more serious than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might have been my imagination, but I couldn’t ignore it, so I suddenly spoke up with a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Before, you had a different caretaker, right? Why did they quit?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Dunno~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako tilted her head slightly. Keigon-san said they quit because of stress, but as for the reason why they were stressed, it’s still unknown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How long did your last caretaker last?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Maybe, two weeks?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s shorter than I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Before that, I think it was three weeks… It was a month at most]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Do you know why they quit so soon..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like before, Hinako tilted her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t look like she’s fond of them, and it doesn’t seem like she’s bothered by it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Hinako doesn’t care too much about the caretakers she’s had before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I don’t think there’s any other job with such good conditions]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Good conditions?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. Because there’s a live-in job with 3 meals a day and 20.000 Yen a day. There’s a lot of pressure, but it’s a pretty good job. Studying at the academy is also really hard&#8230; but if you think that you get an education, it’s not so bad]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of people in this world who want to study but can’t. I was on that side. Well, I was on the verge of being one.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What about me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The good conditions&#8230; What about me?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t understand the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What do you mean?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muu~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako puffs her cheeks and makes a dissatisfied face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you interested in being a gold digger?] (TN: Gold digger is someone who pursues a relationship for money instead of love)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No&#8230; That’s a bit&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By gold digger, you mean</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gold digger?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a bad wish, whether you’re interested or not. Originally, I was not in a position to have a conversation with the daughter of the Konohana family like this, shoulder to shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please don’t quit, Itsuki&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I have no intention of doing so for the time being]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I answered, Hinako smiled softly, and laid down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let me sleep]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m the pillow huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there had been a similar exchange when we were kidnapped, I understood her intentions immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I emptied my lap, Hinako’s head slumped on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ehe~ an exceptional, comfortable place&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Thanks for that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her head on my lap, Hinako immediately went to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at it this way, Hinako’s face is really neat. She is still in her youthful years, but she is far more beautiful than those models.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A normal male student might soar in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for some reason. Instead of being aroused, I felt calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Somehow, there’s a sense of distance&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t feel like we are a man and a woman. Sometimes I am aware of her as a woman, but I’m sure Hinako doesn’t feel like that. So I can control myself. 　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was given the easy name of a “caretaker”, but in reality, our relationship is much more mysterious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But&#8230; It’s not as bad as I thought it would be.</span></p>
<a href="https://ibb.co/qy00FZx"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DVGGgqL/index-84-1.jpg" alt="index-84-1" border="0"></a>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Nn?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smartphone in my pocket began to ring, indicating a call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the academy, the use of smartphones and computers are allowed during breaks. It seems that some of the children of wealthy families are involved in company work even though they’re still students, and that’s why they are taking measures. That being said, during break, I could hear them talking about “Day Trading”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying the name on the screen out loud, I picked up the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You took too long to answer. Next time, please answer within 5 rings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s rather generous of you&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure that Itsuki-sama won’t be able to respond instantly while being in the academy. I’m willing to be a little loose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san isn’t just strict. She also expects high results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve worked for a variety of bosses at my part-time jobs, and I think Shizune-san is one of the best bosses I’ve ever had. That said, she’s also very strict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s lunchtime at the academy, isn’t it? Until you get used to the work of a caretaker, I will be checking on you like this during your lunch break.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is Ojou-sama by your side?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. She’s sleeping right now]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have to bother telling Shizune-san that I’m giving Hinako a lap pillow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you have any problems?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So far, so good. If I had to say&#8230; I guess the class is the most difficult part of this job]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then we’ll have plenty of prep today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Geh, it was a trap]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (TN: The whole trap thing is a line I made on my own, the original word is 藪やぶ蛇へびだった, which is bush and a snake, that probably means a trap because snakes attack from the bushes)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honesty is a good virtue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it could also mean I am a fool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way, I just heard from Hinako&#8230; That all her caretakers so far quit after a month without fail?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san replied, as if she had a hard time saying it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder, why is that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Until now, all of her caretakers have been subordinates of her father, Keigon-sama. However, being a subordinate of him means a subordinate of her as well. That’s why when they acted as her caretaker, their attitude as servants came out&#8230; And this led to Ojou-sama’s bad mood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Hinako, she doesn’t like servants that much, does she?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that’s right. She doesn’t like servants&#8230; or rather, their polite and stiff atmosphere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I have a slight idea of why that is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time we hired a commoner, who has no connection with the Konohana family as a caretaker. &#8230;.When I was having trouble finding the next caretaker, Ojou-sama recommended you, so I half-heartedly picked you as an experiment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So that’s how it happened&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From being appointed as a caretaker, to the transfer to the academy, things were progressing so smoothly that I was a little worried, but it seems like this was an experiment for the Konohana family. This probably occurred because of their policy of trying everything first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is your relationship like with Ojou-sama in the academy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[First of all, I explained that there is a connection between our parents]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a good arrangement. Please keep that sense of distance. &#8230;Do you have a close relationship with anyone yet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s only the first day, so I haven’t been around much&#8230; But I’ve talked to Asahi Karen and Taishou Katsuya]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fumu. Asahi-sama, and Taishou-sama, yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard Shizune-san’s brief mumble. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asahi-sama’s parents are in the retail business… They run an electronic retail store.  It’s a company called J’s Holdings.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’ve never heard of it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san and Taishou, they described themselves as students who were closer to commoners.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I guess they’re not in that big of a company, just like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? I think J’s Electronics is a famous store.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh? J’s Electronics?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve heard of J’s Electronics. In fact, I’ve used their product before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve seen a lot of television commercials for it, it’s a chain store that most of my former high school classmates would know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Isn’t that a very famous place…!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. They’re one of the top five electronic retailers in Japan in terms of sales”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oi Oi… what do you mean closer to commoners? Aren’t you a ridiculous ojou-sama?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, Taishou-sama’s family is a major transportation company, famous for their transporting services”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s also famous&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like I’ve been betrayed. Both of these companies are very well known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The family business of your friend is often talked about and is worth knowing about. Please keep me posted as your network grows. Incidentally, your family ostensibly runs an IT company, so you will also be studying IT from today. Let’s learn at least some programming.” (TN: Programming is complicated, I’ve tried, seriously) (EDN: I’m going into programming, it’s not fun)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Please be gentle with me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please continue to stay with Ojou-sama. If there are any problems, please report to me immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call with Shizune-san ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I let out a deep sigh, I noticed that Hinako was staring at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki&#8230; What’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it’s just, I’ve lost a lot of confidence&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered if I could really get along with people at such a school. All around me are unattainable flowers. I had a feeling that I’m going to  fall apart someday, and I’m going to make the Konohana family troubled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[By the way…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is it&#8230;?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why did you appoint me to become your caretaker?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After thinking for a moment, Hinako replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Because&#8230; I didn’t think Itsuki would flirt]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Flirt?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako briefly affirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I like the way you take care of me&#8230; While thinking, “It can’t be helped”]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like the context from before and now isn’t related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe she’s still half-asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Afternoon classes&#8230; I want to take a break]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s no good]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eehhh~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lunch break was over, and the fifth period began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then the one who’s solving this question is&#8230; Taishou-kun, can you solve this?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh? …Uh, sorry. I don’t know] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: imagine being able to do this irl, world problems would be nonexistent) (EDN: I wish I could do this and get away with it) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher called out to Taishou, but he responded apologetically. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then, Konohana-san. Please take his place]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing in front of the blackboard, she picked up the chalk and wrote down her answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Will this suffice?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As always, it’s perfect. Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Hinako returned to her seat, her classmates looked at her with respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t think that’s the same girl who slept on my lap so sloppily earlier. She said she didn’t want to go to class&#8230;　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chime rang, and the academy had a break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I rotated my shoulders to stretch my muscles, Taisho and Asahi-san approached me. 　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuaa~, I’m tired… I hate the fifth period because it makes me sleepy] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, it’s Taishou-kun, who couldn’t answer in class earlier]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh&#8230; I can&#8217;t help it&#8230; I made a slight mistake in my prep work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that in order to keep up with the classes at Kiou Academy, preparation is a must.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was impressed with Taishou, who said it as if it were natural. I then looked at Hinako’s seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Hinako’s not there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I noticed that Hinako wasn’t in the classroom, I quickly stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m going to the bathroom]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that to them, I went to find Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It hasn’t been more than 5 minutes after the class ended. She shouldn’t be too far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to be sure, I left the classroom and scanned around the hallway — I easily found her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What, so Hinako&#8217;s in the bathroom]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While chatting with several female students, Hinako entered the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few minutes later. Hinako returned to the classroom and sat down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I was about to return, my phone rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is now a good time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I expected it, but sure enough, it was Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps, Ojou-sama has dropped her fortune.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it her wallet?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes. There’s a distance between the location of Ojou-sama’s transmitter and her wallet/”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230; I didn’t know she had a tracker on her]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How untrustworthy is Hinako&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll look for it right away. &#8230;By the way, can you tell me where the wallet is?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s definitely in the west side of the main building, but beyond that is hard to tell.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West side of main building?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call’s timing, and the location of it. This is&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Maybe&#8230; in the bathroom]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Haaah, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must’ve dropped it when she went to the bathroom earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s a perfect girl in public, but she’s always alone in the bathroom. She often loses things there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyways, please collect it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call with Shizune-san ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, even if she said to collect it&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the time being, I went in front of the women’s bathroom, and turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a man, I can’t go inside. What should I do&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, you there?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking, I was approached from the side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, there was a female student with a ridiculously prominent appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long, golden hair was coiled in a spiral shape — known as a vertical roll of golden hair. The girl, whose hair and hairstyle I’ve only seen in the world of manga, is so stylish that you can tell even when she’s wearing her school uniform, and her skin is white. Her brown eyes had a powerful glint in them that suggested she had a strong mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What can I do for you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it’s&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, by the way, I haven’t introduced myself]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl says in a unique tone to my confused and bewildered self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I am Tennouji Mirei! The sole daughter of the Tennouji Group!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl said her name proudly and somewhat self-consciously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huh&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[“Huh…” What’s with that dumbfounded reply? It’s not like you don’t know about the Tennouji Group, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I apologized, Tennoji-san’s eyes widened.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[C-Could it be&#8230; You don’t know about the Tennouji group..? I-It’s the Tennouji Group, you know!?] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I apologize for my ignorance]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s more than just ignorance!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high pitched, angered yell pierced my ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Tennouji Group is a massive group that originated from mining operations! It’s now Japan’s largest non-ferrous metal manufacturer as well as a major chemical manufacturer. The scale is on par with the Konohana Group, you know!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was overwhelmed by Tennoji-san’s passionate speech in a hoarse voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That reaction&#8230; you, you know the Konohana Group, then?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, yeah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-As expected&#8230;! I still dislike her, Konohana Hinako&#8230;! Because of that woman, my fame isn’t spreading&#8230;!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennoji-san’s face turned bright red and shivered angrily. It seems like she has a grudge.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well, are you in some kind of trouble?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tennoji-san asked calmly, I remembered my original goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, I think there’s a wallet that was forgotten in the ladies bathroom but, I was wondering how to retrieve it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll get it for you, if that’s all you need. Please wait for a moment]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying that, Tennoji-san went into the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A minute later, Tennoji-san appeared, holding a peach-colored wallet in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is it, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, why did you, a man, notice a wallet in the ladies bathroom?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… That’s, well&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answer, spinning my head around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The owner of the wallet told me to look for it&#8230; by process of elimination, I thought it might be in the bathroom]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I almost told her the truth. It looks like Tennoji-san sees Hinako as a rival, but she doesn’t realize that the owner of the wallet is Hinako. So I thought that the answer was good enough but&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You, you’re just an errand boy, aren’t you?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennoji-san said in a frustrated tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You can’t do that. If you’re attending this academy, you will be in a position of authority in the future, right? If people is making you their errand boy, I’d be worried about your future]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uhm, I’ll be careful]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re not very confident, are you? Say it to me more clearly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll be careful!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You can do it if you try, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satisfied, Tennoji-san nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then next, you need to straighten your posture. Confidence comes from posture, you know?] (TN: I feel personally attacked) (EDN: Seems like I&#8217;m the least confident person out there, this checks out)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I straightened my back as I was told to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s good]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Tennoji-san saw me do as she told, she smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The class is about to start. If you have any problems in the future, look for this yellow-colored hair]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennoji-san pointed to her own hair and said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a trademark feature, while at the same time, being a questionable one as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um&#8230; I have a simple question, is it okay to dye your hair in this academy?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha-!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she was about to leave, Tennoji-san made a strange sound and stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My&#8230; My hair is dyed…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Isn’t that the case?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Are you saying&#8230; My hair is being mistaken for something being dyed…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I didn’t say that much&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told her it was a simple question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not accusing her of anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I didn’t dye it&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennoji-san said in a low voice, as if muttering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I… DIDN’T DYE IT~~!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shouting this, Tennoji-san ran down the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.She definitely dyed it] (TN:This dude kinda hopeless huh]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the last class was over and&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, Tomonari. Good work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How about it? Do you want to have a welcome party after school?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho and Asahi approached me. But I apologized with a wry smile on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. I was told to leave as soon as possible]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> your first day]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said regretfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was starting to feel guilty. They’ve been kind to me since the morning, but I’ve been refusing their invitations to lunch and to hang out after school. It was natural to prioritize my work as a caretaker, but I was wavering about turning down their invitations just because.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If there’s a chance, can I ask for your help again? I’d like to know more about the academy as well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah! We’re always free!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho and Asahi-san smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Asahi-san took out her phone from her skirt pocket and looked at the screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It looks like my ride&#8217;s here, I’ll be going first then]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think I’ll go home today. See you tomorrow, Tomonari]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said goodbye to both of them and we parted ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I picked up my bag, which was hanging on my desk, and decided to leave school. &#8230;But first, as a caretaker, I had to make sure that Hinako returned home properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now then, Hinako is&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Hinako was leaving her seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Hinako and I are supposed to be in contact with each other, there was no problem in having a normal conversation, but if possible, I’d like to keep a certain distance to prevent any trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako then left the classroom andI followed after her, trying not to let anyone around see me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako left the academy, just as I thought&#8230; but for some reason, she stopped to buy something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can I have one of those loaves, please?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako bought a loaf of bread at the counter, and with it in her hand, headed for the footboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After putting on a new pair of shoes, she left not towards the gate, but to the garden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a number of gardens within Kiou Academy. This time, she went to the one near the old building. There was a small pond and a few tables, but no one was around. It was far from the main building, where the classrooms were, and the old one was no longer in use, so it was less crowded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing at the edge of the pond, Hinako sliced a small piece of bread and dropped it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The swimming Koi swarmed over the torn bread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: If you don’t know, Koi are colorful fish that are normally put in small ponds, usually to attract the attention of people around)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an “Ojou-sama”, Hinako may have a taste for art and compassion for animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there was no sign of her moving afterwards. Shizune-san told me not to make a detour after school, so I checked around to make sure no one was looking before I approached Hinako.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you doing?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Feeding]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could see that. Shedding the mask of a perfect “Ojou-sama”, Hinako was in her natural lazy state, crouched down and gazing at the Koi swarming around the bread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That is nice~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako muttered in a daze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[In this way, you only have to open your mouth to be fed&#8230; I wonder if we can switch places&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m sure even Koi fishes has difficulties humans don’t know]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I wonder about that~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like she doesn’t have compassion for animals, but envies them instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harboring complicated feelings, I let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s time to go home. Shizune-san will be waiting for us]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako replied in a sulky tone. I rolled my eyes, not expecting to be rejected.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You don’t like it? If we go back, you can relax, you know?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can’t… I have lessons and stuff]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s how it was. It wasn’t easy being the daughter of the Konohana family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But that doesn’t mean you have to stay here, it might be uncomfortable for Hinako]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s after school, so it’s less crowded and uncomfortable]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might certainly be the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are no after school club activities at Kiou Academy. That’s because most students are busy with their studies and work after school. In addition, the families of the students are all rich, so they can provide their own swimming pools and grounds for club activities if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But you can’t stay in the academy forever. Cmon, let’s get out of here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nooo~~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you keep on going like this, won’t this just make things more complicated?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, Hinako had a very uncomfortable look, but eventually, she nodded her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[B-but still&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who escaped reality, resumed feeding the Koi in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s a strong hearted Ojou-sama. Now then, what to do&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;By the way, Shizune-san gave me some things]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remembered the black sack that Shizune-san had given me this morning and took it out of my bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that if Hinako wasn’t listening, I could use it. Speaking of which, what was in this bag? I opened the mouth of the bag and took out what’s inside&#8211;　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Potato Chips!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who had been answering lazily till now, is responding with a glow in her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was right, inside the bag was consomme flavored potato chips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consomme is a type of clear soup made from richly flavoured stock or broth that has been clarified, a process that uses egg whites to remove fat and sediment. According to google) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How underhanded&#8230; I can’t resist the temptation&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said in a quivering voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never seen anyone’s will be broken so much by potato chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then if you want this, we’re gonna head home for today]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ngghh]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a frustrated growl, Hinako reluctantly stood up and took the potato chips from my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From here on, Hinako and I would go our separate ways, as we were supposed to. As soon as Hinako passed the school gate, a car in black stopped nearby. Shizune-san came out of the car and greeted Hinako. I watched the scene, pretending to be a stranger, and continued walking the streets alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reached a less populated spot where we could meet and waited for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the car carrying Hinako and Shizune-san stopped nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry to keep you waiting]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sat down in the back seat, answering Shizune-san. Hinako also sat in the passenger seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To those around us, it would look as if Hinako and I had gone home separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[First of all, thank you for the hard work over at the academy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, who has the impression of being strict, made me a little surprised and I nodded my head unconsciously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who’s sitting next to me, is mindlessly eating the potato chips I gave her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I see what I gave you this morning came in handy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It came in handy at the last minute. I didn’t expect potato chips to work so well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s her favorite food. She can’t eat it most of the time, and it’s just as good as any other food]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s just a potato chip, yet she can’t eat it all the time?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course. That kind of unhealthy food isn’t suitable for a lady of the Konohana family]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though they’re from a wealthy family, they’re not free to do whatever they want. In fact, it seems that they’re sometimes more constrained than ordinary people. However&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I thought it’d be fine if it was only a potato chip]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No. This is also an instruction from Keigon-sama. &#8230;She’s allowed to eat the potato chips cooked by the chefs, but it seems like she prefer the ones from minimarkets]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess she likes the taste of being unhealthy. (TN: Some unhealthy foods are great, ngl) (EDN: Tell that to my stomach) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked next to her, I saw some potato chips spilling onto her knees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There’s food debris on the floor]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I warned her, Hinako looked proud for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;It’s the same as eating soba noodles by slurping them up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ha?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Spilling crumbs&#8230; That’s the correct way to eat potato chips] (TN: I’ve rarely eaten potato chips, believe it or not. So is that true?) (EDN: Well it&#8217;s natural for some to fall I guess?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, of course not]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s with that smug look?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’ll pick it up, so raise your hand a little]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako slowly raised her hand. Meanwhile, I picked up the remains of the chips on Hinako’s lap. Shizune-san handed me a plastic bag, and I threw it in there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki, here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako called out to me, and held a bag of potato chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You’re giving me this?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No. I’m imitating a Koi fish. &#8230;Feed me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a Koi fish waiting for a piece of bread, Hinako opened her mouth wide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wanted me to feed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Aaa~&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I picked up a potato chip and put it in Hinako’s mouth, and she looked happy. She can’t be a Koi fish, but it seems she feels like one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just as a warning, be careful not to let Keigon-sama see you like that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s something that can be misunderstood in many ways. It’s probably best not to show it to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Shizune-san, you’re going to keep it to yourself, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’d report as soon as I can but&#8230; unfortunately, even if we were to dismiss your position as a caretaker now, we don’t have a replacement right away. &#8230;Before you hold any feelings of lust towards Ojou-sama, I suggest you cut them off that feeling]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please don’t do that to me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bowed my head deeply to Shizune-san</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I got back from the academy, I immediately started taking lessons from Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We’ll start with tomorrow’s prep. You have a business administration class tomorrow, so let’s focus on that. The scope will be on corporate finance, yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the students at Kiou academy will be in management positions in the future. For that reason, business administration classes are more practical than other subjects. Students are taught the knowledge needed to run a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve graded the quiz. The score is 87&#8230; There are a lot of careless mistakes. You’re not concentrating hard enough]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After three hours of endless prep work until I got a perfect score, I finally finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Next is etiquette class. In addition to Ojou-sama, there are children of all kinds of wealthy families attending the Academy. If you are disrespectful to them, you may cause unnecessary offense, so learn them while you can. In this lesson, we will discuss French table manners]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During dinner, I was still taking lessons with Shizune-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold the fork and knife with your index fingers. Eat the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fish hors d&#8217;oeuvres without breaking them, drink soup without making noise, cut the meat into bite-sized pieces according to the streaks, and then put it in your mouth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No. The British way is to put the knife and fork at six o&#8217;clock when you are done eating and in French etiquette, they are placed at three o&#8217;clock.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place the knife and fork horizontally with the handle on the right side of the plate. The blade or spur of the knife should be facing you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Now for an exercise to help digestion, it’s time for self-defense lessons. Fortunately, Itsuki-sama’s part time job as a manual laborer has given you a good physical workout, so let’s moderately improve your strength and start learning the techniques. Today we are going to learn the art of Jujutsu. First, we’ll start with zenpo ukemi, 100 times] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Zenpo ukemi:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a forward roll from the leading foot&#8217;s shoulder to the hip on the opposite side.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I changed into my judogi and received instructions in self-defense at the dojo of the mansion, just as I did the other day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Judogi is basically a Judo uniform)　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After practicing ukemi, she taught me the basics of throwing techniques, and finally, we practiced sparring against each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuu&#8211;!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naive]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pulled Shizune-san towards me, but at the same time, she did a leg sweep, and I used the kouchi gari. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Kouchi Gari in english is known as minor inner reaping throw. If anyone knows martial arts, please correct me, I have 0 confidence on this field)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Shizune-san saw through me and let my body flow, and when I stumbled from failing, she easily slammed me down to the mat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The timing of your weight shift is obvious. You may be able to defeat an amateur, but you won’t defeat someone with martial arts knowledge]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to hide my exhaustion, I replied in a pathetic voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason I’m learning self-defense is because it is a precaution for things like kidnapping, which is how Hinako and I met in the first place. I heard that in many kidnapping cases, the perpetrators are accustomed to fighting. So the ability to beat an amateur isn’t enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[J-Just, a little… break&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, you can’t. As a caretaker, you are expected to protect Ojou-sama in times of need. I can’t have you giving up on something simple like this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s an oni, this person is&#8230; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TN: Oni is basically demon in Japanese)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oni. Beast. Spartan. Devil. A lot of words came to my mind, but at the same time, I hold a lot of respect towards her. Shizune-san has perfected all of her studies, manners, and self-defense skills. One top of that, she does her maid duties such as cooking, washing and laundry without a problem. If Hinako is the perfect Ojou-sama, then Shizune-san is the perfect maid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s it for today. Thank you for your hard work]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Thank you… very much&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the self defense lesson was over after two hours had passed since I almost screamed out loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You’re learning faster than I thought]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that true?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. You may have a talent for self-defense in particular. If you practice more, it will become something great… On the other hand, manners are harder for you to learn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh&#8230; Sorry]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My family had a standard of living that was far from wealthy. I’m still not used to using a knife and fork properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We don’t want you wandering around the mansion all sweaty, so please go into the bathroom as soon as possible. However, while you are soaking in the bathtub, please look at this]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san handed me a stack of papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[These are profiles of Itsuki-san’s classmates. It won’t hurt to know them]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll research while taking a bath. &#8230;It’s a job with a wage of 20,000 yen per day. I have to take it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, by the way, there’s another person I came in contact with this afternoon]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Who is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Her name is Tennouji Mirei. She’s in a different class&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I said that, Shizune-san rolled her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You came in contact with Tennoji-sama?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. &#8230;Is there a problem?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, there is no problem. However, it is rumored in the academy that Tennoji-sama and Ojou-sama has a cat and dog like relationship, so it’s a fragile situation]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a new one to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As for Tennoji-sama, Ojou-sama has no intention of doing anything. However, the Konohana Group and the Tennoji Group are almost identical in size. Because of that, there are many times conflict occurs between them, and depending on the situation, there may be times when the relationship between the two is strained]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I will have Tennoji-sama’s data ready by tomorrow. For today, please concentrate on memorizing the profiles of your classmates]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes] I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s lesson seems to be over, but Shizune-san asked me to do some self-study as well. I’ll try to memorize the profiles of my classmates by the time I go to bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san was doing a light cleaning on the dojo, and I decided to leave first. I really wanted to help, but I was at the limit of my strength. If I offered help now, I&#8217;d just be a nuisance.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the way back to my room, I met with Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you need? Before I could ask, Hinako closed in on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Muuu]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You smell like sweat]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course I do]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I moved away from Hinako, who frowned at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Where are you going?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m going back to my room and take a bath]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Bath? &#8230;Then, follow me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako took my hand and led me somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Here is&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My room]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The place we arrived at was Hinako’s private room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was more than 5 times the size of my room. It had a large brown carpet, a bed with a canopy, and it was decorated in a way that was expected of an Ojou-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The bath is&#8230; here]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako opened the door at the end of the dressing room where she took off her clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah&#8230; It’s huge]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bath was also quite large, incomparable to the one in my room. Or rather, the bath is about the same size as my room. This is like a small public bathhouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, why did Hinako lead me to a place like this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s go in together]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Why?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? (TN: It’s repeated twice, so it must be important)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kuh&#8230;]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, soaking in the bathtub, let out a disturbed voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her figure was wrapped in a white bikini-type swimsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Swimsuit]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did you say anything…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I didn’t say anything]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised when she asked me to take a bath with her, but apparently the suggestion was based on the fact that we were wearing bathing suits. There were also bathing suits in the changing room, as if she planned to do this from the start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well&#8230; With a bath this big, I can see why you’d want to share it with someone]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would feel lonely if I soaked in this large bath alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuuuun&#8230; Paradise, this is paradise]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stretched her body lightly. Her movements looked strangely sexy. Her face was tinged with a light red tint, and water dripped from her silky amber-colored hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki, what’s wrong?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if wondering what I was doing, Hinako bent down to peer into my face as she sat down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako’s small cleavage appears in my entire field of vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[N-no&#8230; It’s nothing]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I answered, looking away from her pure white skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calm down… Calm down, calm down, calm down. (TN: this is so important it’s repeated 4 times)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I try not to be conscious of it, but Hinako is still a beautiful woman in terms of appearance. If I let my guard down even a little, my desire as a healthy man will outweigh my mission as a caretaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To change my mood, I picked up the papers I had by my side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I read silently through the documents, which were placed in clear plastic to prevent them from getting wet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What’s that?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a profile of our classmates. Shizune-san told me to remember them]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document contains detailed profiles of all students in class 2A. I already know about Taisho and Asahi-san, but the other students also seem to be heirs to major corps, or blood relatives of famous politicians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, is Hinako close to any of our classmates?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[None]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said in her usual matter-of-fact voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[None? You were surrounded by all kinds of people in class]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm… No one is a friend]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than acquaintances, less than friends, I guess. (TN: Ain’t that a manga title?) (EDN: Sounds more like a doujin title)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve only been at the academy for a day, but I more or less understand Hinako’s situation. Hinako, for better or worse, is a bit of an out of place presence in the academy. In the classroom, Hinako is talked to by many people, but from the viewpoint of an onlooker, they look more like followers rather than friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Do you not want to have friends, Hinako?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hmm….]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unusually, Hinako thought a little longer than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;If Itsuki’s there, sure]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll take that as a strong trust in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was feeling a faint sense of joy, Hinako stood up slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako came straight in front of me, and sat down with her back facing me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wash my hair]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at Hinako, who turned her head to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[J-Just wash it yourself!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I always have Shizune do it quietly]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’re not going to wash it yourself?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a small sigh. This was a very Ojou-sama like thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are there any itchy spots?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Noooone~~]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I lathered up the shampoo and washed Hinako’s hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never washed a girl’s hair before. Is it okay to do it like this…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that Hinako always gets her hair washed in the bathtub. After that, she would drain all the water from the bathtub. I think it was a shame all this water was wasted because I’m a poor person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Mmm]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was washing her hair, she let out a small moan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hot… This… a bother]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Hinako reached behind her back and removed her bikini.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wha!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stopped and looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[H-Hey! What are you doing! Put it back on!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But it’s hot… and it’s weird, being in a bathing suit…] </span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xHyBQcq/index-114-1-733x1024.jpg" alt="index-114-1-733x1024" border="0"></a>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s weird that a man and woman are bathing together in the first place!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That being said, this Ojou-sama doesn’t understand.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Bathing suit… I only wore it because Shizune was so persistent…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako messed with the swimsuit she wore, depressed and annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unguarded movement distracted me from my thoughts again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Wait a minute]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if I had heard a word that I should never have missed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Shizune-san, does she know? That we’re taking a bath together]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako gave a small nod.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, I realized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why hadn’t I noticed this before. The door to the bathroom was open about five millimetres. In the gap, a murderous gaze was fixed on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Huh!?!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My body trembled in fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Shizune-san. How long has she been watching us?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door opened a little more, revealing Shizune-san’s face. Shizune-san silently nudged me to wash Hinako’s hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Mmm… it tickles]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[M-my bad]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, I managed to calm my agitation and continued washing Hinako’s hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I extended the shower head beside me and rinsed off the shampoo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Alright, I’m done…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t feel alive for a second there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I was taking a bath, my whole body was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thanks. ….I’ll make this a daily routine]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Wash me… every night]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, Hinako stood up and headed to the dressing room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait a minute… That means, I’m going to have to feel this fear every night from now on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if to replace Hinako, Shizune-san came in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her eyes were very cold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you for your hard work, Itsuki-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Y-Yes, you too… Um, how long have you been watching?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From the very beginning]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From the very beginning huh…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means she must’ve seen me being dragged around by Hinako.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve prepared a change of clothes in the dressing room, so please use that when you come out]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah yes. Thank you very much]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[And-]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san placed a bottle of medicine beside me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you are likely to experience any ulterior feelings towards Ojou-sama in the future, please take this beforehand]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is..?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the side effects of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, these drugs are intentionally used to combat ED and make &#8220;it&#8221; not rise up. To put it bluntly, it’s the opposite of viagra.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Huh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I drink that stuff, I’ll become a maid!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched and trembled as she put down the medicine and walked away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second day of my school life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students were gathered in the large gym, wearing gym clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Today we will play badminton]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A female teacher in the PE class said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at Kiou Academy, which produces and trains future managers and politicians, there are still PE classes. It was the same with my old high school, where there were 2 classes, and each was divided based on gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the students of class 2A and 2B were gathered in the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Girls will use the east side of the court and boys will use the west side]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then boys, let’s get a move on]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The male teacher in charge led the students to their assigned courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to the classroom lectures we’ve been doing, I felt much calmer. Even in normal public school, the content of this class will always be the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari. You, have a better body than I thought]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… I sometimes do muscle training]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I move, I have a light talk with Taisho next to me. In reality, I was trained in physical labor. I’ve already quit, but Shizune-san is teaching me self-defense, so I’m sure I won’t have trouble exercising anytime soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… This is a big gym]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, it’s about 3000m square meters. I guess it’s big for a gymnasium] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than a gymnasium, it’s a giant hall for events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Once you’re warmed up, start doing rallies] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After running around and doing some light stretches, badminton practice began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, several lessons have been held before. It soon became more like a match, and Taisho and I, waiting for our turn, moved to the sides of the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Phew]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to Shizune-san’s help, my body still held up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I think I can keep up with my gym classes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad. It’s a tough school life for me in a lot of ways, but I think I don’t have to  worry about PE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey there, Tomonari-kun]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, I was approached from behind. I turned around to see Asahi-san behind me. Apparently, Asahi-san was also waiting for her turn and had too much time on her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I saw it~ You were really good at that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not bad at sports. Asahi-san, you seem to be somewhat decent yourself though?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh, did I give it away? You’re right, I’m pretty good at it too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Asahi-san said so in a proud way, Taisho called out to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Asahi’s a good skater too, right?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m confident in my sense of balance. What about you, Taisho-kun? Maybe golf?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah, I’m good at golf. My parents used to make me play with them when I was a kid]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said with a laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard their conversation… I felt terrified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… do they teach skating and golf at this academy, by any chance?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. In the sophomore year, we play polo]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[P-Polo…?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It&#8217;s a kind of equestrian sport. You ride a horse and control a ball with a stick]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horse, ride on it..?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve never ridden a horse in my entire life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">—I was naive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I could keep up in PE class but… I have no experience in golf, skating or polo. Apparently, there’s no escaping Shizune-san’s lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I let out a sigh and looked at the court. It looked like I still had some time before my turn came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Speaking of which, the design of the gym uniform of the academy is very elaborate, isn’t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, yeah. I heard it was designed by one of our graduates]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san said as she pinched the bottom of her collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. He’s the younger brother of a world-famous designer now, so I’m sure we’ll get a good price for their designs in the near future]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow, it’s an amazing world huh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to escape from reality. After all, Kiou Academy doesn’t fit me what so ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, it’s Konohana-san]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san said, looking at the center of the court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako was standing with her racket in hand. The shuttle was lobbed up, and Hinako smashed it hard and sharply. The shuttle fell into the corner of the opponent’s court, and Hinako scored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Konohana-san, not only can she study, she can also exercise well]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right~. She’s also a target of admiration for us girls]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only Taisho and Asahi-san, but the other students also looked at Hinako with admiration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard beforehand that she was someone with both literary and athletic skills, and there was no doubt she had the ability to live up to that reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But when it comes to PE, it’s not just Konohana-san…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said as he looked away from Hinako and gazed at the other girls.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah… Miyakojima-san is awesome too]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san also nodded and looked at another female student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They looked at one of the girls who had their black hair tied up, all the way to her thighs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to Hinako, she has a more slender figure and was tall for a girl&#8217;s size. Her eyes and nose were as good as Hinako, and her face was more of a beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl hit the shuttle back with light footwork and knocked it down into the opponent’s court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun doesn’t know her, right? That person is Miyakojima Naruka. She’s not as famous as Konohana-san, but she’s pretty well known in the academy]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is she a celebrity?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[As you can see, she’s very good at sports. I think she was higher than Konohana-san in PE. And you know what? She’s a cool beauty with a strong sense of humor]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Cool beauty huh…] (TN: This was written in Katakana, so it was kurrubyuti)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true that she’s someone with a dignified appearance that suits her well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, the most peculiar characteristics is… that]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san mumbles to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Practice was over and the girl walked out of the court. At that moment, two girls who were watching the practice walked to the girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[U-um! Miyakojima-san! Good work out there!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You were very good at it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somewhat awkwardly, the two girls struggled to talk to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the girl looked at them with eyes as sharp as blades, and…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Huh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hiih!? I-I’m sorry!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-It’s nothing!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two girls were intimidated by her cold voice and ran off, their faces pale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asahi-san, who was watching the scene, let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t really want to say this but… Miyakojima-san is a little scary, isn’t she? Basically she remains silent all the time and has a stern expression on her face]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve heard a lot of rumors. Behind the scenes, there’s motorcycle gangs and yakuza related things…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho said in a shocked tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, it’s only a rumor and you don’t have to believe it at all… Either way, it looks like she has walls around her. I’ve tried to muster up courage to talk to her a few times before, but she just shrugged it off, saying she had something to do]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiou Academy is a school where only the best and brightest students are allowed to enroll. There is no such thing as bullying or discrimination in this school. But I guess there are students who are displaced like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari, it’s our turn]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taisho told me to head to the court. The PE class eventually ended without a hitch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was on my way back to class after changing in the locker room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked for Hinako just to be sure, but she was in the middle of moving with other girls. The fact that she was popular was working out. Aside from the lunch break, the short break between classes is something not to worry about since someone would always be nearby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Ah]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s up, Tomonari?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry. I think I left my shoes in the locker room, so I’ll go get them]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left Taisho and went back to the changing room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been so conscious of Hinako that I’ve neglected my belongings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, found it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the door to the locker room and found my gym shoes on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My next class was coming up, so I hurried out of the locker room&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Whoa!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I walked out the door, I almost bumped into a female student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at each other in astonishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you okay?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. Sorry…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I apologized, I looked at the girl’s face and froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyakojima Naruka. The girl who had been the topic of our conversation not long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[T-Then, I’ll be going this way…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to feign ignorance, I got back on my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I immediately tried to go back to the classroom, but then, the girl grabbed me by the sleeve and held me back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard the girl’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You, could you be… Itsuki?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A chill ran down my spine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened my mouth fearfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Chigaimasu!] (TN: this was written in Katakana, and so I thought I’d put it as it is. Chigaimasu is “you’re mistaken”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No… no, no, no! Itsuki! You’re Itsuki! I’m sure of it!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face tore into a smile, and her voice was full of joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl looked at me with glitters in her eyes.　</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uuuu… Uaaaa.. Itsuki!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl, tears welling up in the corner of her eyes, approached me with her arms out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve missed you&#8211;! Itsuki!!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Gueehh!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She hugged me, vigorously.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s talk about the past for a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was taken care of by the Miyakojima family once before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tomonari family has been struggling to make ends meet all year round, but in fact, my parents only attempted to divorce once. It seems that useless humans felt comfortable in the company of another useless human, and although they’ve been living a sloppy life, they seemed to be on the same page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when I was 10 years old. A divorce almost occurred once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something had triggered my father and my mother so they tried to pin the reason for their poverty on the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The riot intensified to an unusual degree in the Tomonari family, and my mother decided to run away from home, and I was taken away without any reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she ran away from home, she had nowhere to go, as her parents already disinherited her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So my mother visited her relatives’ house instead of her parents’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it was… The Miyakojima family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I later learned that my maternal grandmother was the daughter of the Miyakojima family. However, she, just like my mother, lived a life of self-indulgence and depravity, so she eventually got disowned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, my mother insisted [It was my mother who was disowned, not me!!], and decided to become a resident of the Miyakojima family. Surprisingly, this worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, at the age of ten, I was suddenly ushered into the most opulent and luxurious Japanese style house I’ve ever seen, and welcomed as a guest of the Miyakojima family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we were uninvited guests. The Miyakojima family clearly saw my mother as a nuisance and an interloper. I, her son, was not excluded from this. I still remember the cold stares I received at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was on the second day of living at the Miyakojima household.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I first encountered Miyakojima Naruka.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-Who is it!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was swinging a shinai, a bamboo sword, at the dojo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl yelled at me as I approached her because I thought she looked unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, My name is Tomonari Itsuki. I’ve been here since yesterday]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know a single thing about etiquette, but I still managed to give a polite and respectful greeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the girl hung her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Listen here, Itsuki! I don’t like any weak things!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve heard so much about you! You guys don’t do any work, all you do is eat!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t expect to hear such thing from a person of the opposite sex in my age, and I felt depressed. But it was true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, I’m going to give you a job! You’ll have to take care of me, from now on!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tilted my head at the girl who said it so proudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure what she meant by taking care of her… In any case, I’m a houseguest. If I am given a job, I have no choice but to accept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From then on, I stayed with the girl most of the time when I was staying with the Miyakojima family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl called me more than 10 times a day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uwaaaa!? Itsuki! T-There’s a bug in my room~!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes, I’ll take care of it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On behalf of the girl, I effortlessly drove the black thing out of the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uwaaa!? Itsuki! F-Father got angry~~!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes yes, it was hard wasn’t it]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I patted the crying girl’s head to calm her down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl’s father was giving me a fierce glare, and I actually wanted to cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… is stronger than me]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so?]</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nPYHm5V/Screenshot-20220715-123343.png" alt="Screenshot-20220715-123343" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. Because, unlike me, you don’t cry when there’s bugs, or when adults get mad at you]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were days when it was noisy, and there were days when the girl would occasionally let out weak cries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, I think the girl wanted to have someone to support her. As the only daughter of the Miyakojima family, she had no one to show her weakness to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was strong, but only physically, not mentally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it’s said that at the age of ten, her kendo skills were as good as any adult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her heart… wasn’t any older, but even less children her age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Itsuki. As the sole daughter of the Miyakojima family… I want to become stronger]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl spoke to me with a somber, pained expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But, I don’t have courage]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Courage, is it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can’t even go outside by myself… Even though I’m already grown up]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that the girl was forced to live an overprotected life as the daughter of the Miyakojima family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’d been taught from a young age that everything outside her home is a dangerous place, and she has come to fear the outside. However, when she was driving to school the other day, she was struck by the sight of her classmates going to school without a care, and felt envious of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Would you like to come out with me as a test?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think it’s fine if it’s just for a little bit]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having grown in a general household, the outside is something I’m used to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I took the girl’s hand and ran out of the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Amazing!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl was excited. It was the first time she’d been outside alone without an adult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Amazing! Amazing, amazing, amazing! I feel— Free!!] (TN: Eren flashbacks kekw)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a mere street, the girl was smiling with her arms stretched as if she’s walking through a field of flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Itsuki! What is that!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s a candy store. Would you like to go in?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a good thing I had some coins in my pocket, so I can buy her some candy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I didn’t feel comfortable being stared at coldly by the servants while I was in the mansion, so I was more than happy to be outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki, what’s this!?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s an umaibo] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s good!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Because it’s an umaibo] (TN: umaibo is like a japanese stick snack, and there’s a joke where she says “umai na!” and he responds this way because umai is a japanese way to say it’s good/delicious.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl ate the snack with a curious look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game of taking her outside continued for the next few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were told that if her father found out, he would be furious, so we kept sneaking out of the house so that the servants wouldn’t find us, and we would only spend a short time outside so they wouldn&#8217;t be suspicious.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But eventually, this little game of ours was discovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The girl’s father scolded me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you going to do if something happens to Naruka!? I’m not going to let you seduce my daughter, even if she’s a child! Get out of here now!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t understand it at the time, but it seems that the Miyakojima family daughter shouldn’t be taken out of the house so easily. As compensation for endangering her, my mother and I were kicked out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They must’ve originally planned to kick us in the near future. The servants quickly packed our belongings, and my mother and I were easily driven out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we were about to leave, a girl shouted my name with tears streaming down her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ll become strong, I promise&#8211;!!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the last words I heard from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That girl is Miyakojima Naruka, the female student in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, me and her are— cousins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki! Itsuki, Itsuki, Itsuki!! I missed you so much!!] (TN: this girl really likes to repeat words)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes yes]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While patting Naruka’s head, who was hugging me, I casually looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there was no one else in the hallway but us. If anyone saw us in this situation, it would be the end. On my second day of transfer, I’d be accused of impure sexual relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naruka, for the time being, calm down. What if someone sees us?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uu.. Uuugh.. My back gave out…]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m so happy, my back gave out…!]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With tears streaming down her face, Naruka crouched down on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t… getting stronger at all… </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an emergency in which Naruka couldn&#8217;t move, so I had to hurriedly carry her to the nurse’s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The nurse… isn’t here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe they were called somewhere else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I borrowed one of the beds and had Naruka sit on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was nothing more to do, so I tried going back to the classroom…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Uuu, wait… don’t leave me…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She begged me with tears in her eyes, so I had no choice but to skip class and accompany Naruka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put my hand on my forehead. Fortunately, it was class time, and Hinako should be in the classroom. When she’s in class, she can act like the perfect Ojou-sama, so it doesn’t matter if I’m around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki. What happened to you after you were kicked out of my house?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka asked me as I sat down on the bed, and I answered her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s just the normal thing, parents making up and everything was okay]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m glad to hear that… but you could at least have contacted me. I was worried about what happened to you after that, you know?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… Sorry, but I didn’t know the Miyakojima family house number]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s true]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I had been able to contact her, it would’ve been difficult to talk to Naruka. My mother and I were not familiar with the Miyakojima family, so it was unlikely that she would be in touch with us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I know it’s a little late now but, I’m sorry about when I was little. I was such a jerk to you when we were kids…] (TN: just to clear it up, this is MC, while the next part of dialogue is Naruka)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you apologizing for!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said, looking frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Rather, I’m very grateful to Itsuki! If I hadn’t gone out with you that time, I’m sure I&#8217;d still be a coward…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she said that, I felt a little proud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Aren’t you still a coward now?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ugh… no, I mean… I’m still figuring it out…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka murmured awkwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but laugh. If she had become someone strong as she said, she wouldn’t have had to be carried to the infirmary like this, slumped over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">]Well, Naruka’s father seems to be a strict man. He doesn’t give you a lot of freedom, does he?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;No, I beat my father]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You won against him?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. Kendo, Judo, Aikido, Karate, and every martial art there is. That was the condition for me to be free from the restrictions of the family. …Thanks to that, I’m mostly free now]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-Is that so]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As always, she’s a very strong girl, physically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… even if I’m allowed to go outside, it’s lonely without anyone next to me…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka instantly lost her energy and muttered to herself as she looked down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From the looks of it, Naruka has been misunderstood in many ways at the academy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminded me of what Taisho and Asahi-san said before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said that she was a biker and involved with the yakuza, but that wasn’t true at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right. …Everything is a misunderstanding]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Why did that happen?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked, and Naruka let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The family motto of the Miyakojima family is “A healthy mind resides in a healthy body”. That’s why I’ve been trained in all kinds of martial arts since I was a child]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;When we first met, Naruka was doing Kendo, right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. The Miyakojima family is a family of martial artists, so to speak]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A family of martial artists… that sounds like a very unique family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as I was once a resident of that house, I know that it wasn’t an exaggeration. Not only did the Miyakojima family have their own private dojo in their residence, but they also ran another dojo next to their residence. I remember during my stay, I could often hear the voices of the students calling out to each other. (TN: if you are not familiar in martial arts, there are some sequences in karate, judo, etc. where you have to scream as a sign of completing a technique or movement)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Maybe it’s because of my family background, but I’m often thought of as a troublemaker. On top of that, well, you’re Itsuki, so I can say it…. I’m not very good at making friends. When I’m in front of someone, I tend to tense up and my face stiffens. As a result, I’m often being misunderstood as a scary person…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka has a beautiful face, however her eyes are very sharp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she gets nervous, you feel like you are being glared at.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well… Naruka’s always been like that. You have a big attitude, but when we go out together, you’re very timid and cry easily…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-If you say it that way… that kind of stings]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But it’s true]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ughh… You’re right]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka lets out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought, I was going to make friends and have a good time at school. But I was so nervous that I couldn&#8217;t talk well, and when I tried to make eye contact with someone, they thought I was glaring at them… then I found myself being called a delinquent or a yakuza… Uuuuuu….]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s terrible. I have no words but “bad luck”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know what to do…. Hey, Itsuki. Please, please help me!!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka pleaded to me with tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From what I’ve heard so far, Naruka is a very pitiful figure. If I could help I would definitely do anything I could…. Then I realized my pocket was shaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, sorry. I have to take this]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left the infirmary and picked up my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one calling was, as expected, Shizune-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Itsuki-sama, where are you now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m sorry. A student fell and I had to take them to the infirmary]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? Even though she should be in class, the GPS was out of sync so I thought something was wrong… If that’s the case, I’ll let you off”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please return to class as soon as possible. It’s all well and good to help others, but don’t forget your duty as a caretaker.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was expecting to be scolded and reprimanded, so this was a bit anticlimactic for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe… She can see where I am right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, for now, let’s get back to class as soon as possible like she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before that, I’ll check on Naruka one more time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I opened the infirmary’s door, Naruka turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hey, Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Speaking of which, why is Itsuki at the academy?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Well then. How… should I explain this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, my official position is that I’m the “heir of a middle-class IT business” and my relationship with Hinako is that we’re acquainted through our parents. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this won’t work on Naruka. As she knows my true identity and family condition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a caretaker, I must at least protect Hinako’s status as the perfect “Ojou-sama” in the public eye. …I must answer modestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;.I told you long ago that my mother was a gambler right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. I heard that it was awful]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka felt sorry for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She won and got a lot of money. Thanks to that, I was able to attend the Academy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a spur of the moment lie, that was pretty good. That’s what I thought but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That’s a lie]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said while squinting her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kiou Academy isn&#8217;t somewhere you can enter only with money. There will be a strict background check before you’re enrolled. Assets required through gambling and such will not be accepted]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well f*ck…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder how the Konohana family got me enrolled. I’m not sure if there’s a backdoor only influential people use.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki… Why did you lie? Are there some circumstances you can’t tell…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that my lie was exposed made me even more suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was in panic, dripping in cold sweat, my phone rang again indicating an incoming call. It was probably Shizune-san. The fact that the call came in without a delay from earlier suggests it might be important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, sorry… I got another call from…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried refusing and was about to leave when…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, wait wait!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka grabbed my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You… aren’t going to disappear again… right?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka asked in a timid voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the sad expression on her face, I reflected on my situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">――I see</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made Naruka feel uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years ago, I suddenly left and disappeared from Naruka’s life. At first, I was also worried… but before I knew it, my memory of it faded and I forgot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Naruka was different. Before she met me, she’s never been around kids her age. That’s why, unlike me, Naruka will always remember that day, along with the anxiety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s okay, we’ll see each other again]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Really…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Really]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t expecting to see Naruka here, but I’m honestly happy I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just because I have my job as a caretaker, doesn’t mean I have to push Naruka away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Then… um, pat me… on my head…] (TN: whoa I didn’t expect that)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Eh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Like back then! You used to do that for me! Like when my father was mad at me…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come to think of it, I used to pat her a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m worried about the phone call, that still didn’t stop. I’ll just do as she says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stroked her head, and Naruka giggled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ahh… as expected, it’s calming]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t think a high school student should be calmed by a pat on the head] (TN: Rude) (EDN: All high school students should have the right to be calmed by a head pat!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I know that! It’s just… this was a very important memory for me… I honestly didn’t think I’d meet Itsuki again…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like in the past, Naruka’s words were honest and straightforward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feeling fuzzy, I continued to stroke Naruka’s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. Back then, I suddenly disappeared]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;But we finally met again. This is good enough] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka smiled at me, looking relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was then that the infirmary door opened. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[――What are you doing？</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the sound of her voice, I stopped stroking Naruka’s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako appeared from behind the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hina――]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[K-Konohana-san!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka’s voice drowns out the words that came out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[H-How come Konohana-san is here…?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’ve been feeling a little under the weather, so I left the class]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, playing the “Ojou-sama” role, replies in a matter-of-fact tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the phone that’s been ringing stopped… It’s gone. Was Shizune-san trying to tell me this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun and Miyakojima-san, did something happen between you two?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako asks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I caught a glimpse of Naruka, she looked completely nervous and tense. …This is why other people are afraid of you. From the side, it looks as if Naruka is glaring at Hinako with a tremendous amount of pressure. However, Hinako doesn’t seem to be fazed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess I should be the one answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah… about that, I saw Naruka collapse in the hallway, and I carried her to the infirmary]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well, is that so… Did Miyakojima-san have any injuries in the head?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Head? No, nothing like that…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is that so? I thought it was like that, since Tomonari-kun seems to be patting her head]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her tone was as usual, but her eyes seemed to be a little clouded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew I was being watched…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[K-Konohana-san, l-listen to me! Me and Itsuki met a long time ago!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said in a nervous voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A long time ago..?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s right! Around the time when we were 10 years old, Itsuki stayed at my house..]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Stayed?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt that Hinako was slightly frowning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Naruka didn’t seem to notice this and tried to affirm in a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes! At that time, I had Itsuki take care of me!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Take care?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako frowned at Naruka’s explanation. Though it wasn’t so much of taking care, but more of a playmate… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki was my benefactor, so to speak, who took care of me when I was a child. So I was just happy to see him again]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked convinced. However, for a moment, I thought she had a complicated look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh yeah, Itsuki. Would you like to come to my house again? It’s okay if you just come to play… If it’s okay with you, I’d be happy to have a relationship like before again…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka said to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that was something I couldn’t do because I was acting as Hinako’s caretaker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Naruka, that’s――]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[―That’s not possible, Miyakojima-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I can say anything, Hinako answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun is working at my house right now]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Fueh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from Naruka, who made a strange voice, I was surprised and my eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hina―Konohana-san. That’s a little…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What’s wrong, Tomonari-kun? That’s true, isn’t it?]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s true but… we promised to keep it a secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, the mere fact that I was working for the Konohana family wasn’t enough to find out about Hinako’s true self. In the unlikely chance of Naruka spreading the word, Hinako and I would gather the attention of the entire academy. It would be a problem for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[W-wha… What does she mean, Itsuki!? You’re working at Konohana-san’s house now!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, that’s…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a glance at Hinako’s face, confused and annoyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if I denied it here, it’d be meaningless if Hinako affirms it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Well, yeah, I guess. I mainly… take care of the surroundings]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka’s eyes widened as I answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Unfair]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naruka glared at Hinako with resentment and envy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s not fair, you! I was..! Itsuki, he was originally my..!!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t know about the past, but Tomonari-kun’s current workplace is my home]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako says while smiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Tomonari-kun. Miyakojima-san seems fine, shouldn’t you go back to your classroom now?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A-Ah.. you’re right]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m probably looking very flustered right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako looked at Naruka one last time and bowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think I’m feeling better now, so if you’ll excuse me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako closes the door with a soft and gentle smile, the same with her facade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the other side of the door, I heard Naruka going [Uggggghhhh…!!!] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">　――Sorry, Naruka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I’m Hinako’s caretaker. I basically can’t go against Hinako.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And… Hinako and I have a few things we need to discuss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Did you come to the infirmary to see me?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah. ….I was at loss when I’m alone, so I told the teacher I was feeling unwell, and I got guided partway]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who dropped her facade, explains.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry. I’m Hinako’s caretaker but I wasn’t close to you. …But what’s with that earlier? Shizune-san said to keep our relationship a secret, didn’t she?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, I can’t think of Naruka as someone who would spread rumors for fun, but there’s always a slight chance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, walking next to me, answered in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I just thought]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hm?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I just thought… It’d be better to make her back off]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That answer didn’t make sense to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or could it be she’s… Jealous? (TN: HE’S NOT DENSE?!) (EDN: !?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Is that the case?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminds me of how distant I’ve been from Hinako recently. I didn’t think Hinako had developed such emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako asked me as I tilted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki is whose caretaker?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Of course, it’s Hinako]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn… Then it’s fine]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako then stopped and looked at me with a satisfied smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s go… get scolded by Shizune together]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded and let out a deep sigh. We can’t avoid getting scolded when we’ve done this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if they fire me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">♢♢♢</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m not going to fire you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After school, the day I met Naruka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said to me as I explained while we were driving to the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From what I’ve heard, the problems are not only with Itsuki-sama, but also with Ojou-sama. In fact, if Ojou-sama hadn’t said so much, there’s a higher chance of her dodging the question, no?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;But, it was originally because I got in touch with Naruka]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Miyakojima-sama fell in the hallway, didn’t she? Then it can’t be helped]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inwardly, I thanked Shizune-san. Shizune-san is strict, but also flexible and accommodating. She’s not so cold and cruel as to forbid any help to others just because I’m a caretaker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I thought I knew about the relationship between Itsuki-sama and Miyakojima-sama, but it seems I didn’t do enough research]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;You knew about it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I knew the two of you are cousins, but I didn’t know you’re already acquainted with each other. …Perhaps the Miyakojima family was deliberately keeping it a secret. Since Itsuki-sama’s family and the Miyakojima family are in a state of deadlock, it may have been to avoid any unnecessary suspicions]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, Keigon-san made a comment about the relationship between the Tomonari and Miyakoijma family. I guess he was already aware about the relationship of the families at that point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, for this one, I am also at fault. …Now that it’s come to this, it’s better to explain the situation to Miyakojima-sama to some extent. First, explain in detail that you work for the Konohana family, and then offer them a deal as hush money] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. I’m sure that she’ll keep quiet but… I’ll let her know]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of Naruka’s personality, she wouldn’t be one to start a rumor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides… Naruka doesn’t seem to have any friends to talk to. (TN: Now that’s just rude) (EDN: It’s just a fact tho)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since servants aren’t allowed to attend the academy, Itsuki-san will continue to be the heir of a medium-sized company. On top of that, let’s set it up so that you’re coming to the Konohana family for service. …I’m glad they didn’t find out about Ojou-sama, but honestly, I didn’t want them to know that Itsuki-san was working for the Konohana family either. It could be an obstacle in search for Ojou-sama’s partner]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Obstacle, huh?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You have a classmate of the opposite sex living and working in your house? That doesn’t sound like a good impression to have]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I see]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The image of being a perfect Ojou-sama was ruined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Kiou Academy is also a social gathering place. Please continue building your relationships carefully]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded to Shizune-san’s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um, Shizune-san. There’s another matter I want to address…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What is it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Um… can I go out with my classmates?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Go out, is it?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san’s eyes squinted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, I’m not trying to get carried away. It’s just that a classmate of mine asked me to go out with them the other day…. I feel bad continually refusing him, and I feel like it’s a bit too unnatural to keep refusing him…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;That is indeed true]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly convinced, Shizune-san pondered for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand. If you let us know the schedule in advance, we’ll support you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Thank you very much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not giving up my work, but I should socialize to make myself look not too bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I don’t mean to put myself on the shelf, but please reflect on this matter, not only Itsuki-sama, but also Ojou-sama]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I nodded at Shizune-san’s words. But… Hinako, who was sitting next to me, didn&#8217;t give any response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ojou-sama, are you sleeping?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Shizune-san turned to me and checked, I smiled bitterly and replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[She isn’t sleeping but… she’s clinging to me like a koala]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako grabbed my right arm and pulled it to her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been in this position since I entered the car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Pat me]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, who buried her face in my arms, said in a quiet voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[My head, pat it…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yes yes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stroked Hinako’s head as told.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san let out a sigh and looked forward again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After returning back to the mansion, I took lessons from Shizune-san, got dragged around by Hinako for another bath, and finally finished my work for the day. I wiped my slightly damp hair with a towel and returned to my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the door to my room and Hinako, who had been behind me for a while now, dived into my bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[After a bath, a bed is… bliss]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I understand how you feel]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though why are you sleeping in my room?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If you sleep here, I’ll wake you up in the middle of the night]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuuuー]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I called out to her, Hinako rolled over and fell asleep. She was already asleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Seriously, you sleep too much]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, she slept at school, and if she sleeps from now until the next morning, she would’ve slept for more than twelve hours. It’s fine if it’s once in a while, but Hinako slept that long everyday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put a blanket over Hinako, who was sleeping in the bed, and I studied some more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few hours later. I looked at the clock, which pointed at 1 in the morning, and stretched lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako. It’s time for me to go to sleep, so go back your room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I turned around, Hinako was lying on the bed, staring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[You were awake?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;can’t sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said with a displeased face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m too tired to sleep] (EDN: Too relatable)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that even Hinako can&#8217;t keep sleeping indefinitely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;What do I do]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What to do… even if you say that..]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my hand on my forehead, I pulled my textbook to the edge and picked up the papers on my desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The manual for this was at…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I read the manual that described how to deal with Hinako in detail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was written about what to do if Hinako couldn’t sleep. However――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[ “Give up and accompany her until dawn”&#8230; Hey, I also have school tomorrow]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering my grades, I didn’t want to neglect my schoolwork. For that reason. I wanted to avoid sleep deprivation as much as possible. It’s already difficult to keep up with the classes, even without being sleepy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Somehow… I feel like I&#8217;m going wild…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Stop]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I firmly told Hinako, who’s itching to move her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’d rather not get you out of control but… Some light exercise should be fine. If you’re exhausted, you might be able to sleep again]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, Hinako’s room has a bath. It’s not a problem if she sweated a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The question is, how do we exercise…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking about it, Hinako tugged the hem of my clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Let’s go for a walk?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if she said we go on a walk, we can’t go out without permission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hinako knows that. So, she suggested that―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[A walk around the mansion. Well, with a place this big, it should be enough]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Yeah]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako nodded as she grabbed my sleeve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But… There’s a different vibe here]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mansion at midnight was filled with a unique atmosphere. It’s like something out of a horror movie, and I felt like I was doing a test of courage. I felt like I was breaking into a cold sweat, not from exercise, but from fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even more than that, my mind was filled with something else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">―Exhaustion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Hinako, I was planning to go to bed and sleep soon. Honestly, I was too tired to walk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako, on the other hand, seemed to be fully awake and walked around with my arm in tow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… maybe, the dining room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[..Really?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s the office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[That’s… the parlor] (TN: A parlor is a reception room)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Is that so]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the library.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real Hinako doesn’t want to use her head as much as possible, so she often takes the wrong path. But unfortunately, I don’t have the energy to go into each of them now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Muuu… Itsuki, are you listening?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako stopped and looked at me with an upturned gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sorry. I’m a little sleepy…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Even though, I thought about showing you around]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she said that, I felt bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it weren’t at this time, I’d be welcome to that idea but… when I think about it, most of my plans are already booked until night. This time with Hinako might be valuable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t you have a favorite spot or something?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I rubbed my eyebrows, trying to shake off my drowsiness, and asked Hinako. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;Favorite?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako doesn’t stay in her room all the time, right? For example, while I’m taking lessons with Shizune-san, where would you be except your room?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I told her that, Hinako gave a small nod as if she understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’ll take you there]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako takes me by my hand and we start walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten minutes later. After many wrong turns, we finally reached our destination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a small kitchen door at the end of the hallway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, this is your favorite place?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yeah… the exit of the mansion]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is this her favorite place to be…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Sometimes I sneak out here… and into the garden]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oi]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the looks of it, this door is a blind spot from the rest of the house. It’s also far from where the servants work, so patrols are infrequent. It’s a good place to sneak in and out of the house, but it’s too far from the gate that leads to the garden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Are you sure? If you tell me, I might tell Shizune-san]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Itsuki wouldn’t do that. …I told you because you’re Itsuki]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako said while smiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s human nature to want to respond when someone trusts you that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Fuaaaa… I’m getting sleepy]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako puts her hand over her mouth and yawns.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Let’s get you back to your room]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Nn]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, the walk made her drowsy again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hinako entered the room immediately and laid down on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Well… I guess I’d better get back and sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I closed the door quietly and tried to go back to my room. Then―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you doing?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Whoa!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, someone spoke to me from behind, and I jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back, Shizune-san, who was glaring at me, is standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think it’s rude to be surprised like that]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I-I’m sorry…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised because it was late at night when there’s no one and it was filled with silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moonlight shining through the window illuminated Shizune-san. Seeing her, I was speechless for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is something wrong?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, it’s just… this is the first time I saw Shizune-san without her maid outfit…] (TN: WHERE ARE THE ILLUSTRATIONS!?) (EDN: WHEEERE!?!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san, the perfect human-maid being, is not working right now. She’s wearing a nightgown with her hair down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is it strange?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s not strange, it just feels new and fresh… and um, it’s a little more childish than usual…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I think you’re trying to pick a fight]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m sorry, I’m not!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might’ve been better to say that she looks younger. No, that would’ve been rude as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m too sleepy to think straight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[For the most part, I’m still a college student]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Ah, is that so?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Yes. So please tell me I look appropriate for my age]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had expected her to be young, but I didn’t think she was a student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What are you doing in university? You’re always working in the mansion]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I’m on academic leave]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh right, you can take voluntary leaves from university.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Shizune-san had been offered a job with the Konohana family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So, what are you doing at this hour?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It’s nothing much…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I explained that Hinako couldn’t sleep and that she was taking a walk around the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Oh, so that’s what it was]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Hinako is always sleeping… Does this happen often?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[No, this is the first time]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised by the answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[But doesn’t the manual mention cases like this one?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Please read carefully. It’s for when she wants to stay up late, not when she can’t sleep. There is no manual for when she can’t sleep]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Hinako’s usual lifestyle isn’t that messy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Don’t worry, I guess she’s a little out of it. For better or worse…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a small voice, Shizune-san murmured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since Itsuki-sama’s arrival, Ojou-sama has changed, for better or worse]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I’m sorry]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I can’t say it’s a bad change in general, so I can’t blame you. It’s just that…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san murmured even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;I hope, Keigon-sama doesn’t mind]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shizune-san said, looking conflicted.</span></p>
