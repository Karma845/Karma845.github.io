<h3>Afterword.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Sakaishi Yusaku. Thank you for picking up this book. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m very bad at managing page counts, which is why the space in the afterword is so small. I have done this often in other works. Sorry…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This work [Saijo no Osewa] is a romantic comedy set in a school where children of rich people gather. If you like romantic comedies, or if you like Ojou-sama heroines, you will enjoy this one. We hope you will love these heroines, who are rich, gorgeous, beautiful, noble… and also prone to different troubles. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like to thank the editorial staff, reviewers, and others involved in this work. Thank you, Miwabe Sakura-sensei, for the wonderful illustrations. The various Ojou-samas you’ve drawn are all very attractive and full of individuality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to all of you who have picked up this book.</span></p>
