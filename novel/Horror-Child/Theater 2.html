<h3>Theater 2</h3>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 1</strong></p>

<p>Lowell Residence (Day)<br />
Tsugumi faces Koharu in the living room.<br />
She turns her nervous look towards Koharu.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>The day after I bought a smartphone with Rin-chan, I was in the living room of the mansion, meeting the woman who would be taking care of me. She had silver-rimmed glasses and black hair, a clever expression, and looked at me with a worrying gaze. “Cool beauty” would be words appropriate for her, and she is my manager and servant from today, helping me with my daily life and supporting me with my work.</p>
<p>Koharu-san bowed so politely that it was hard to believe she was dealing with a child, and then, we exchanged our contact information. Indeed, she seemed to be able to do her job well and was very trustworthy.</p>

<p>“Well then, Koharu-kun, take care of my Tsugumi. Make sure to listen to what Tsugumi tells you.”</p>
<p>“Daddy? I’m a kid, you know? I&#8217;m the one that does the listening, you know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, leave it to me. If Tsugumi tells me to die, I shall do so quickly.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I won’t do that, all right? I won’t just so you know.”</p>
<p>Well, but, yeah… she may be a little more mischievous than I thought.</p>
<p>“You will be traveling to the TV station, not in your usual car, but in a company car that you will be using from now on. If there is anything you think is inconvenient or any points of improvement, please do not hesitate to let me know. I will begin working on it at any time.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Points for improvements… For the car? It&#8217;s going to cost a fortune. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18176' title='Flowingcloud: Doesn’t translate well into English. Previously Koharu was saying that she’ll improve (the car) at any moment, but it could also be interpreted that she was referring to herself as well. It was left vague on purpose in Japanese, but someone hard to do so in English.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>As soon as I left the entrance hall, I found a car parked in the roundabout in front of the fountain. Standing in front of the door was a gentleman in his prime of life with tousled black hair. His name is Makabe-san, a driver who has served our family for three generations. He is the son of the driver who drove us to the audition venue the first time.</p>
<p>I was a little relieved to see that the car was not a limousine as expected. That… rea~lly stands out, you know. It seemed to be a black passenger vehicle with an ordinary boxy shape, and I wondered if my father and mother had held back, thinking that this was good for a rookie. As I approached thinking so, I stiffened at the phoenix markings on the tire axle.</p>
<p>(This is a Century…) <span id='easy-footnote-2-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18176' title='Flowingcloud: A Toyota Century. It’s a luxury vehicle mainly produced for the Japanese market, thus fairly unknown for foreigners. It’s basically the Lexus LS in Japan for those who know their cars. Technically, it is classified as a limousine sedan, so in a way, it is a limo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Century&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Century&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>The Century is synonymous with Japanese luxury cars. It has a TV screen for the rear seats, and the interior (it was no longer at the level of just inside a car) is designed to be comfortable, and they were pursuing high quality. I know because I once played the role of a ghost who cursed and killed a politician in a Century, but in this car, the front passenger seat could be removed to make a hole so that you can stretch your legs…</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t even need to think about how she perceived my stiffness. Koharu-san looked at me somewhat anxiously.</p>
<p>“As expected, is this too small?”</p>
<p>“No! I thought this was very nice!”</p>
<p>“Is that so? If that is the case, then that’s good.”</p>
<p>That was a close call. After all, this is better than a limousine in any case. If I want to stand out, I want to stand out with my acting skills.</p>
<p>I was once a horror actress who could make anyone scream just by walking up to them after all! I feel guilty for scaring Sakura-chan with my ghoulish acting every time we meet though. But I mean, she looked so happy even though she was scared…</p>
<p>“What music should I put on?”</p>
<p>“Please give me your latest recommendation.”</p>
<p>Music, music, huh? I don&#8217;t really know about the latest music these days. When I used to listen to music in the ‘90s, I didn&#8217;t hear about enka among my friends anymore and pop music was beginning to dominate the world. I also remember that dancing at a disco was very popular. I even heard about a body-conscious gyaru who was murdered by a pimp who wanted revenge. <span id='easy-footnote-3-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18176' title='Flowingcloud: Don’t have to tell you what gyarus are right? Also, ‘90s music was dominated by going to the disco genre and dancing at a club. Enka is the old-fashioned Japanese music you hear sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enka&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>Music can change drastically given twenty years. Twenty years ago, when I was alive, enka music was everywhere, but just before I passed away, enka music had almost stopped selling. Thus, what is popular now? Did we go around in a circle and go back to jazz?</p>
<p>“The most popular music among young people would be Vocaloid.”</p>
<p>“Vocaloid?”</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s music using synthesized voices, refined by Yamana&#8217;s music synthesizer software called Vocal Robot.” <span id='easy-footnote-4-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18176' title='Flowingcloud: The term used in the previous sentences is ‘ボカロ’ which is the abbreviation for Vocaloid in Japanese. There is no appropriate corresponding term in English, thus I’ll use “Vocaloid” when abbreviated and “Vocal Robot” (the parody name) when the official term is used. Also, Yamana is just a parody of Yamaha, mostly known for their musical instruments (especially pianos).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Corporation&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_Corporation&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>“R-Robot? Synthesized???”</p>
<p>T-That&#8217;s strange. How can things change so much in twenty years? I mean, robots will be dancing instead of humans, right? The world of science fiction is this close… P-Perhaps, could it be that AI robots are working as receptionists in stores or something… probably not, huh? You said “synthesized”, right, Koharu-san? I guess it&#8217;s like human synthesizing music and a robot singing.</p>
<p>Uh-huh. However, it definitely is a good idea to learn more about modern knowledge, isn&#8217;t it? It feels like I’m recovering my memories as a kid. That’s good.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll play a popular song.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please do. Koharu-san.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>While chuckling at Koharu-san&#8217;s serious reply, I tried to enjoy Koharu-san’s selection of music. Pop, Taisho romance, jazz, or jazzy ballads. I see, you can do so many things just by buying one.</p>
<p>“Koharu-san, this synthesizer software, how much does it cost?”</p>
<p>“You can buy it for somewhere around 20,000 to 30,000 yen… Would you like to purchase it?”</p>
<p>“I’ll! … I’ll be fine. I was just wondering… A-Ahahaha.”</p>
<p>“? I understand. However, if you do want it, please do not hesitate to speak up.”</p>
<p>“S-Sure.”</p>
<p>I died in the year 2xxx in my thirties, but I entered the industry at fourteen and worked part-time to earn money until I was twenty, when I began to see the light of day. I had a part-time job at a cafe where the wages were just barely at minimum wage in exchange for flexible hours.</p>
<p>At that time, my part-time wage was just a little under 500 yen per hour. The rent was 10,000 yen for a 4.5 tatami-mat apartment with cold drafts and a common bathroom with no bath. After deducting the utility bills, the funds for studying to be an actor, and savings for the future, I only had about 5,000 yen left over. That&#8217;s how much I would spend a month. In other words, the music software is equivalent to half a year of my salary. It&#8217;s not like I’m going to go down that path. I can&#8217;t buy that sort of thing casually… <span id='easy-footnote-5-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-18176' title='Flowingcloud: Honestly, readers might complain, but it’s really hard to get out of that sort of spending mindset, even when you get richer. Thus, I find it rather understandable why although she can pretty much command all the money she wants, she can’t bring herself to spend that money however she wants. Maybe this changes in the future, but not now.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>
<p>“We are arriving. I am going to stop.”</p>
<p>“Roger.”</p>
<p>Koharu-san responded seriously, but it was not like there was any sudden braking, thus I was able to get up without feeling any shaking. Rather than the skill of the driver or safe driving, the performance of cars has improved…</p>
<p>Makabe-san opened the door for us, and Koharu and I headed towards the designated place without any issues. It seems like the meeting room in the station was where we agreed to meet.</p>
<p>All things considered…</p>
<p>(For some reason, I&#8217;m worried about being stepped on.)</p>
<p>From a child&#8217;s perspective, just about everything looks bigger. It&#8217;s hard to say because the TV station&#8217;s location and interior design have changed from the past, but it used to be so small that the station was filled with stuffiness. But now, everything is big and spacious. It was as if I was Gulliver. <span id='easy-footnote-6-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-18176' title='Flowingcloud: For those who do not understand the reference, Gulliver, from Gulliver’s Travels, discovers a race of tiny people, less than 6 inches (15cm) tall.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>As I was looking around, I suddenly noticed a poster on the wall. Was it a thriller film? On the large poster, there was a woman in a white coat and a man in a police uniform. There were also the names of various actors and instigating words. I thought the composition was interesting, but I could not keep my eyes off the leading actress. Her black hair flowed smoothly and her eyes were calm. She possessed strong eyes that were both gentle and fierce.</p>
<p>“Kiritani, Ouka…”</p>
<p>Kiritani Ouka.</p>
<p>A woman who retained the looks of “someone” from the distant but near past.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi-sama?”</p>
<p>“Ah… sorry, Koharu-san. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I followed Koharu-san in a hurry. I responded, “It’s nothing”, to Koharu-san’s puzzled look, and drove away from the poster just now into the corner of my head.</p>
<p>The meeting room was a spacious room with a long desk. Everyone else, including the child actors, was already gathered inside. The meeting time was still 30 minutes away, but everyone was early. I am the newest member of the group, so I should have come a little earlier.</p>
<p>The cheerful red-haired girl named Asashiro Juria-chan. Yuugao Mimi-chan, a girl with brown hair tied up in two knots and wears glasses. Then, there is Yoruhata Rin-chan, a dark-haired girl who was even communicating with me this morning on a messaging tool called Lane. Each of them had a woman in a suit by their side. They were probably their managers.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, over here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, it&#8217;s Tsugumi. You&#8217;re going to be the villain, right? This way, over here.”</p>
<p>“S-Stop it already, Juria-chan. Good morning, Tsugumi-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, good morning.”</p>
<p>Starting with the cool Rin-chan, Juria-chan and Mimi-chan followed and made me feel welcome and they ushered me in. I exchanged glances with Koharu-san, then joined the group of children. Koharu-san returned my glance, then took out her business card and went to greet the other managers.</p>
<p>“I am a manager, Mikado Koharu. I am looking forward to working with you today.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, oh my, how polite. I’m—”</p>
<p>I glanced backward at Koharu-san, then I planned on mingling with my own group. My seat, well… Rin-chan was leading me by her hand and I ended up sitting next to her.</p>
<p>Rin-chan seemed to be enjoying herself as usual. I feel like she&#8217;s the one having the most fun as a kid. But I&#8217;m sorry, I still haven&#8217;t made any progress in GureBure. I&#8217;ve never even played on the NES properly, so I&#8217;m not familiar with this kind of game.</p>
<p>“Juria-chan, do you play any games?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. My mom doesn&#8217;t come home very often after all. I play games like Tamashi, Sullen, and also… can’t leave out Biopandemic.” <span id='easy-footnote-7-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-18176' title='Flowingcloud: I tried to make some educated guesses on the actual game from their parodies. Maybe some smart reader can enlighten us about the second one.&lt;br /&gt;
『霊』(Tamashi) → I think it’s Tamashii (It’s on Steam.)&lt;br /&gt;
『SULLEN』 → Thanks to a kind commenter, SULLEN most likely refers to Silent Hill. Please thank Malphis in the comments for their information.&lt;br /&gt;
『バイオパンデミック』(Biopandemic) → In Japan, Resident Evil is called Biohazard. Biopandemic… Biohazard… Get it? '><sup>7</sup></a></span>
<p>“Agh, Juria-chan’s are too scary so we can’t play them together.”</p>
<p>“Mimi’s just a scaredy-cat!”</p>
<p>Scary game… you like scary games? I&#8217;ve played some mythological horror TRPGs, but I wonder if it’s any different from that. Come to think of it, I feel like Sakura-chan also said something similar. She didn&#8217;t know anything about TRPGs and I recall feeling guilty for making her cry as the gamemaster.</p>
<p>Looking back on it like this, wouldn’t it be strange at all if Sakura-chan hated me? Well, I do believe that she enjoyed being with me in the end. But, hmm…</p>
<p>“Tsugumi doesn&#8217;t play games at all.”</p>
<p>“R-Rin-chan, your ability to communicate is strong, isn’t it? You’re already this close.”</p>
<p>“? Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Then, let’s come over to my place, and let&#8217;s play some co-op!”</p>
<p>“You sure? Thanks, Juria-chan!”</p>
<p>“Awawawa, i-it’s better if we don’t.”</p>
<p>“Then, I&#8217;ll also come. Mimi, you’re coming, right?”</p>
<p>“Ehh.”</p>
<p>One way or another, I was relieved that we were getting along better than I thought we would. When it comes to horror games, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be able to improve my acting exp. In the past, I had to make up for everything with my imagination, so I had to study anatomy and physiology when I played a ghost with a broken leg and a limp. But now, even without spending all my time in the library, I can still find plenty of teaching materials.</p>
<p>“Sorry, we’ve kept you all waiting.”</p>
<p>As we were chatting, the young staff member I had seen on the day of the audition opened the door and entered the room. Following him was Director Hiraga, and someone who looked like the producer. Rather, isn’t that Kuramoto-kun? His age is getting to him, isn’t it… Eh, is the person next to him the scriptwriter, Akasaka-kun? Then again, it&#8217;s been twenty years, hasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>…It may have been a blessing in disguise that I had no relatives in my previous life.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s nice to meet you. I am Kuramoto Kouji, the producer of this drama. I’m entrusting Director Hiraga with the things at the scene, and I’m just in charge of the planning, so please feel free to chat with me. Hahaha,” Kuramoto-kun smiled beneath his black sunglasses and said in a reassuring manner.</p>
<p>His cheerful behavior seemed to be perfect for interacting with the children since Mimi-chan&#8217;s shoulders relaxed noticeably.</p>
<p>“I am Mitsunori Akasaka, the scriptwriter. If there’s anything you don’t understand like the dialogue or meanings, feel free to ask me.”</p>
<p>This brings back memories. In the Showa 60s, when I was in my mid-teens, I shot a late-night drama with a small production company. At that time, the boy who was working all over the place and had a passion in his body that would put an adult to shame was Kuramoto Kouji, who was 18 during the time. He was studying television while attending university, and I was the same age as him at the time, so for some reason, I felt a certain affinity for him. <span id='easy-footnote-8-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-8-18176' title='Flowingcloud: Fun Japanese calendar system. Showa 60s refer to the last few years of Emperor Hirohito’s reign as the emperor of Japan. The Showa year only goes up to Showa 64 (1989) when he passed away. Thus, Showa 60s pretty much just refers to 1985-1989. Refer to Wikipedia if you’re interested in reading more about the Japanese calendar system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calendar&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calendar&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>8</sup></a></span>
<p>At that time, he was the assistant director, and besides him was a boy who aspired to become a scriptwriter. Akasaka-kun—he was the one who mistook me for a real evil spirit and fainted for the first time, as I became popular with my performance as an evil spirit in the late-night drama. I remember very well that I apologized to him later and had to buy him a Chashu ramen and fried rice set, which was a lot of money for me at the time. <span id='easy-footnote-9-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-9-18176' title='Flowingcloud: The assistant director, left ambiguous in the raw, was Kuramoto Kouji, as hinted in Theater 1 Scene 6. In Scene 6, there was a conversation that mentioned that Kuramoto was an assistant director and Akasaka was still an apprentice at the time.'><sup>9</sup></a></span>
<p>(This is so nostalgic.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t go back to those days. Because I had played the roles of dead people, the absurdity of the situation was unexpectedly familiar to me.</p>
<p>“—Last but not least, I am the director, Hiraga Daisuke. From now on, I&#8217;m going to think of everyone as my own family and won’t hold back, so please take care of me.”</p>
<p>Director Hiraga spoke in a more relaxed manner than at the audition.</p>
<p>“First of all, I would like Akasaka-sensei to tell us about the plot and the casting of this drama. Sensei, please.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Akasaka-kun stood in front of the whiteboard in the conference room with a friendly smile.</p>
<p>“Although still tentative, the drama will focus on bullying and mystery. The protagonist will be a new teacher named Mizuki Sana, played by actress Aikawa Mizuho-san. Supporting her, who was newly appointed to be the assistant teacher, will be the homeroom teacher Kurose Kimihiko, played by actor Tsukishiro Tougo-san, who is the center of the adult group. You guys will appear as classmates in the class they are in charge of.”</p>
<p>I see. If bullying is the focus, then our role will also be a central one. The person concerned is a child. The adults will have to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>“First, Asashiro Juria will play the role of Natsukawa Akari, the class leader with a strong sense of justice.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Yay, the good girl role…”</p>
<p>“Next, Yuugao Mimi-san as Harukaze Mina, a kind-hearted and quiet girl who is bullied and pushed around.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. I&#8217;ll do my best!”</p>
<p>Akasaka-kun drew a relationship diagram on the whiteboard and gave an easy-to-understand explanation. Rather, I wonder if the basis of this relationship was the improvisational play we had done at the audition.</p>
<p>If that pulled their heartstrings, then I would be getting more than I deserved as an actor, but I wanted to play an evil spirit anyway. No, it would be outrageous for a newcomer to choose their work.</p>
<p>“Next up is Sorahoshi Tsugumi-san as Hiiragi Lily, the half-Japanese girl who controls the class from behind the scenes and is the key person for the theme this time.” <span id='easy-footnote-10-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-10-18176' title='Flowingcloud: Usually, I translate foreign names as first name then last name, however, she has a Japanese surname, as I just want to keep consistency.

<p>“Yes. I&#8217;ll do my best to the best of my ability.”</p>
<p>“Good. Thanks. The only friend that Lily lets her guard down with is Akimi Kaede who will be played by Yoruhata Rin-san. I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Akimi Kaede has an older sister named Azusa in high school. The role of Azusa will be played by Minauchi Ran-san, who was with all of you at the audition, so I look forward to working with you all.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>After Rin responded, she whispered in my ear, “I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s someone I know.” I&#8217;m sure she’s very good at making friends, so I don&#8217;t think she needed to worry about it that much.</p>
<p>“Also, there is a mysterious girl whose true identity I will not tell the actors until the very last minute. She is a girl who gives us hints about bullying, various incidents, and problems that occur inside and outside the school. I would like you to play her, Sorahoshi Tsugumi-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>“—! Dual roles?” <span id='easy-footnote-11-18176' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-11-18176' title='Flowingcloud: Dual roles refer to when one person plays two roles. Sometimes, it’s done on purpose to provide a thematic significance, which is most likely the case here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_role&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_role&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>11</sup></a></span>
<p>Playing two roles as if you were two different people. When acting, it’s difficult to switch between two roles on the same stage. There’s quite a degree of difficulty for a newcomer, especially for a child actor.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t that be a burden?”</p>
<p>The person who spoke up was Koharu-san. Taking my burden into consideration, Koharu-san asked modestly as she raised her hand.</p>
<p>“Of course, there will be a reasonable burden. Thus, if Sorahoshi-san refuses—”</p>
<p>Refuse?</p>
<p>Turn down a role?</p>
<p>My mind replayed the meeting room of some time ago. Brushing aside my co-stars, who were arguing over who was playing what and who not playing what, I alone put my finger on the flames of destiny. I have never forgotten the moment of passion that lit my heart on fire.</p>
<p>Kirio Tsugumi never refuses the work that is given to her. Then, what about Sorahoshi Tsugumi? There was only one answer.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>“—Are you sure, Tsugumi-sama?”</p>
<p>“Yes. After all.”</p>
<p>That’s right, there was no way I was going to quit.</p>
<p>“It would be such a shame not to perform such an interesting role.”</p>
<p>If I didn&#8217;t accept such a challenge, my actress’s soul would go rotten.</p>
<p>When I followed my heart and said this, for some reason, the Akasaka-kun and them suddenly stopped moving and their eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>“—mi-san?”</p>
<p>“Ha, haha, I’m sorry if I faint.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Errr, what should I do?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I just waited for an answer. The strange atmosphere hurt my skin and all I could do was sit there with my head tilted in puzzlement.</p>

<p>Hinomoto Television (Day)<br />
Tsugumi introduces herself.<br />
Tsugumi looks over the script.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>—Starting spring, Mizuki Sana, a new teacher appointed to Private Shikidai Affiliated Elementary School, got lost in the vast grounds on the very first day. A child with a hood on called out to the wandering Mizuki. The child, with a young voice that could be described as a girl&#8217;s or a boy&#8217;s, guided Mizuki. Mizuki was captivated by the child’s mysterious air, but the child&#8217;s voice suddenly brought her back to her senses.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Onee-san. From here on, it&#8217;s the devil’s home.”</p>
<p>The wind blew violently and Mizuki shut her eyes reflexively. As she was about to ask in detail what they meant, she stopped herself from asking. Because when she opened her eyes, there was no child in sight.</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>After the face-to-face meeting and the assignment of roles finished, we were informed of the shooting schedule, including script reading and rehearsals. Normally, even the last episode of the drama could be filmed first due to the scene and the cast, but for this drama, they wanted to keep the real emotions of the cast (the child actors) in mind, so they will only film scenes up to a certain point.</p>
<p>The reason why they limited it to the child actors only is simply that they don&#8217;t want to tell the development of the story to the child actors. They give out regular scripts to the adult cast. Well, we are kids after all…</p>
<p>(I am acting as the mysterious child, but it&#8217;s definitely the same person. Does she have a split personality? But, I want to act like a completely different person, so it&#8217;s a mystery.)</p>
<p>It would be interesting if they were different people, however, the mysterious child, the character named Lillia, does not appear in the same scene as the villain, Hiiragi Lily. With that in mind, I could imagine what would happen.</p>
<p>Thus, I guess my role is to act in a way that makes the audience think I&#8217;m a completely different person, often seen in horror movies where the character is actually an evil spirit but pretends to be a good person.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi-sama, you seem to be having fun, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Koharu-san… I am!”</p>
<p>Meeting in the morning. After a lunch break, I met with the other cast members in the afternoon. I don&#8217;t know a single actor who is active in this day and age, but I wonder if they’re doing well. I wonder if I will be fine, I am a child after all.</p>
<p>…Come to think of it, there doesn’t seem to be a woman named Kiritani Ouka in the cast. Too bad.</p>
<p>“Your bento has already been prepared. Would you like to eat in the car?”</p>
<p>“Is it okay if we eat in the staff cafeteria?”</p>
<p>“! No, I see. Understood.”</p>
<p>The only thing that was regrettable was the fact that I couldn’t eat together with Rin-chan since she had to meet up with her manager, but in exchange, let’s deepen my relationship with Koharu-san.</p>
<p>I would appreciate a meal with Koharu. I am grateful, but I can’t bring myself to eat in a luxury car since it made me feel out of place.</p>
<p>“[This is Lowolf-04. Secure seats in the staff cafeteria.]”</p>
<p>“Koharu-san, if there are no seats, we can just give up, you know?”</p>
<p>“[Abort mission.]—Understood. But, are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The back of the stairs will be enough!”</p>
<p>“What… how admirable. Well then, let’s do that.”</p>
<p>If I sat down on a seat that was suddenly secured by people of unknown affiliation, it would literally be conspicuous in a bad way, Koharu-san… As I thought, I&#8217;m still not used to this sort of feeling.</p>
<p>I received my lunch from a man in a black suit who seemed to be a member of my staff, then went to the staff cafeteria, and sure enough, it was full. At the cafeteria, I was introduced to a vacant room where the transportation staff sometimes took a break, so I ate my lunch there.</p>

<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever eaten such a cute and luxurious lunch box.</p>
<p>But since I had the chance, I asked Koharu-san about many things while enjoying my lunch. Her hobbies are going on a stroll and bird-watching. Her favorite food is sushi and her least favorite food is avocado. The more information you have, even if it&#8217;s just a trivial detail, the more you can see about a person&#8217;s personality. All of this will become the accumulation of experience.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why, when you’re bird watching, the atmosphere and clothes that don’t draw attention are important.” <span id='easy-footnote-2-18177' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18177' title='Arocks141: Why do I get the feeling Koharu isn’t talking about watching ‘birds’?'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>As I was listening to Koharu-san&#8217;s words, I realized that it was a good time, so we changed locations.</p>
<p>I had thought that Koharu-san was a very uptight person, but after talking to her, I realized that was not the case. She was very serious about her work but also cherished her personal life.</p>
<p>“This is the room.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>I entered the room before Koharu-san and bowed, then found several men and women gathered in the room. The number of people in the room was sparse, indicating that not everyone has yet assembled.</p>
<p>One of them, a woman with brown hair and peach-colored lips, looked at me and smiled. She has a mature face, but when she smiled, she looked like a little girl.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the fairy I&#8217;ve heard so much about, aren&#8217;t you? You&#8217;re even cuter than I&#8217;ve imagined!”</p>
<p>“Errr… thank you very much. I am Sorahoshi Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yup. Ah, I’m Aikawa Mizuho. I&#8217;m playing the role of Mizuki Sana, the new teacher. I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I look forward to working with you!”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re very energetic, aren’t you? That&#8217;s a good thing. Mhm.”</p>
<p>Aikawa-san patted my head with a friendly smile. I wonder what it is, but I felt the same atmosphere as Rin-chan coming from her…</p>
<p>“Aikawa-san, aren’t you troubling that girl?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. Right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You patted me very gently!”</p>
<p>I replied to the man further in the back. He was a man with black hair and sharp eyes. His neat appearance and sharp sanpaku eyes conveyed a sense of scariness despite his good looks. When he&#8217;s acting, he could probably play a very impactful role, but right now, he&#8217;s more of a young man in the neighborhood type of person. He has a soft air about him.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m Tsukishiro Tougo. During the drama, I’ll be acting with you all as a teacher named Kurose Kimihiko. I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Newbies should be cheerful. The lessons I learned as a rookie naturally operated my body.</p>
<p>However, I wonder if it was fortuitous that I was able to greet the two main cast members. Hm? Do kids use the word &#8220;fortuitous&#8221; nowadays? Oh, whatever. I reek of an old woman anyway. <span id='easy-footnote-3-18177' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18177' title='Flowingcloud: The term used was ‘僥倖’ meaning fortuitous, luck, windfall, godsend, good fortune​, etc. It’s a pretty outdated term that isn’t often used, especially by the younger generation. More common to see it in writing than speaking.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>It seems that because of their previous schedule, the two of them were especially early. Juria-chan, Mimi-chan, then Rin-chan came afterwards. Then, there was Minauchi-san. Then, Kakinuma Sozo-san, a famous actor playing the role of principal in this drama. There are many actors, including Asada Fuyo-san, who’s playing a teacher.</p>
<p>…I am meeting some of them for the first time, but Kakinuma-san is my senior from my previous life. I&#8217;m nervous.</p>
<p>“I-I look forward to working with you!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, it’s good that you’re so energetic. You don&#8217;t need to be nervous, I won&#8217;t eat you so it’ll be okay.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but stammer in nervousness. No, but I feel like his personality has mellowed up compared to my previous life. Well, I was thirty when I died in that accident. Kakinuma-san was thirty-six at the time. It must have been a tough time for him. This brings back memories.</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t agree with your method. Wouldn&#8217;t it be best to let a stuntman handle it?”</p>
<p>“With all due respect, Kakinuma-san, there is no stuntman capable of inspiring more fear than me.</p>
<p>“Hm? It&#8217;s as if you don&#8217;t trust the producer. How about you know your position?”</p>
<p>“You will understand if you let me act. You can confirm for yourself.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going so far, convince everyone in this place. If you can, that is.”</p>

<p>…Thinking back, I&#8217;m pretty sure he scolded me harshly and a lot. Well, but this was only for the actors on the scene. In his private life, he treated me very well, such as treating me dinner, barhopping until the morning, and drinking until we were wasted.</p>
<p>He was very caring, but at the scene, he was fiercer, stricter, and more respectable than anyone else. It sounds good to say that he’s mellowed up, but I&#8217;m a little sad that I can&#8217;t see Kakinuma-san from those days.</p>
<p>“Everyone, you&#8217;re all here.”</p>
<p>The people who entered the room were Kuramoto-kun, Director Hiraga, Akasaka-kun, and the other staff. Today is the get-together. Afterward is the script reading. <span id='easy-footnote-4-18177' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18177' title='Flowingcloud: Here to advertise one of my most favorite novels: “Life, Once Again!” The reason why I mentioned it is because, in the novel, the protagonist becomes an actor.

Arocks141: *Ahem* Sellout. *ahem* But seriously, check it out. (Another sellout)'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>However, since they wanted to see how the actors would act, they were going to have a rehearsal (a reading of the script with the actors standing around, using desks and tape as a set) as well.</p>
<p>The name of this drama is still tentative, but it will be generally decided by this.</p>
<p>Kuramoto-kun wrote the title on the whiteboard: “Fairy’s Box”.</p>
<p>“The story is about a new teacher, Mizuki, who is assigned to a combined school deep in the mountains. As she deals with various problems among the innocent elementary school students, she meets four of her main students: Natsukawa Akari, Harukaze Minaho, Akimi Kaede, and Hiiragi Lily, as well as a mysterious child named Lillia. The story revolves around solving the problems around Lillia and the rest. In the process, they overcome various hardships, such as the love between Mizuki and Kurose and incidents in the past.”</p>
<p>The setting is just as I heard from the beginning. Also, the title was basically decided, which means, they’re probably going to proceed as is.</p>
<p>Then, after each of us introduced ourselves and our characters, we decided to conduct the script reading of the first episode. Before we started, however, Kakinuma-san raised his hand with a troubled look on his face.</p>
<p>“Director.”</p>
<p>“Yes. How may I help you?”</p>
<p>“You say the children will proceed without knowing the truth, but shouldn&#8217;t you tell Sorahoshi-kun, who has a special role to play, to some extent of the truth?”</p>
<p>“We took that into consideration, but for now, we decided to give it a try first.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Is that so?”</p>
<p>Is this what I think it is? Letting me freely try first? Hahaha, this Tsugumi here has a reputation for satisfying people with unreasonable expectations from her previous life. There was no set and the script was in my hands. Even so, I was not sitting on the chair like usual, but since this is also a rehearsal, I can read the script today standing up. If that’s the case, let’s do my best to exceed your expectations!</p>
<p>Kakinuma-san didn&#8217;t seem to be convinced one way or another, but he seemed to agree that they should take a look first. The script I was given in the morning was mostly memorized by my body, which is far more high-spec than my previous life. It would be suspicious, so I held my script, but I can probably behave normally.</p>
<p>“Well then, let&#8217;s start from the beginning. Aikawa-san, Tsugumi-chan, please go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>The first scene is an important one that gives the impression of the atmosphere of the story, where Mizuki, a new teacher, is warned by a mysterious child when she gets lost in the large, dense school grounds. In this scene, the director gave me instructions on the intonation and acting style, and I made adjustments, so I have to take my acting seriously. I have to nail my role.</p>
<p>Well now, I wonder what the circumstances are. For the time being, shall I act as the good persona of Hiiragi Lily? Hiiragi Lily is possessive and a child hungry for love. Then, the reverse side of her personality is self-sacrifice and giving love?</p>
<p>“Well then, scene—”</p>

<p>A kind-looking new teacher.</p>
<p>The hardships that are to arise.</p>
<p>The disaster that my reverse personality will bring.</p>
<p>Ahh, I have to save this person.</p>

<p>“—start.”</p>

<p>I don’t care what happens to me after this.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 3</strong></p>

<p>Hinomoto Television, Spacious Room (Day)<br />
Kakinuma looks towards Tsugumi and Mizuho faces one another, he nostalgically recalls the past.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>In a pure-white room (stage) lit by bright fluorescent lights, a young girl and a lady held a script in their hands and faced each other. Is it because of “her” name? Or perhaps, is it due to her words that I heard from Kuramoto-kun?</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but recall a flashback of the past from seeing this scene.</p>
<p>The first year of the Heisei era has passed, I met a woman who was just beginning to make a name for herself at the time. She had appeared in a number of scary movies and was an excellent actor behind the special effects makeup. She hid her real face under a veil and laughed that she could go out on the street with no makeup on and not be noticed. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18178' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18178' title='Flowingcloud: Heisei 1 is 1989. All eras end on the last day of April and start on the first day of May, thus Showa 26 and Heisei 1 are both 1989. Although the eras start and end like so, the month and day follow the Western (Gregorian) calendar.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>I met her later in a film that would later be known as the turning point for her. The title of the film was, if I remember correctly, The Depths of Evil. The first half of the film is about the forbidden love of a woman who was attracted to a beautiful girl. The second half is the story of a woman who chased after a beautiful girl, who was assaulted and killed by the villain, becoming an evil spirit and taking revenge on the villain. The protagonist is the twin brother of one of the assaulters, who mistakenly attacked him after he died in an accident. I appeared in the film as the brother who helped him.</p>
<p>Until then, she had been nothing more than a “promising horror actress”, but her forbidden love affair with the girl astonished everyone, including me. The rest of the film, except for her scares, was somewhat incomplete. However, I wondered if an actor could nail the audience&#8217;s heart so tightly.</p>
<p>(You still had a future. The young me dreamed of a future with you. You always surprised people—you ran too fast.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never forget that One Cup we had as we talked about our dreams on Benkei Bridge in Akasaka. One way or another, we made a connection, and I&#8217;ve never forgotten our spirits clashing against each other. <span id='easy-footnote-2-18178' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18178' title='Flowingcloud: One Cup is a bottle of sake (in can shape) that can be found widely in Japan.

<p>“Scene—”</p>
<p>I looked at the girl who did not bear the slightest resemblance to her at all. She had silver hair and blue eyes—an exotic appearance—but her features are somehow familiar. It was so mysterious, and “fairy-like” would be a good adjective to describe her.</p>
<p>Her name is the same as hers. However, other than that, everything else is different. This is normal. This is normal—but I felt my skin feel a tingling something that I remembered in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“—start.”</p>
<p>Aikawa-kun, playing the role of Mizuki, looked around restlessly. It was just her acting lost, but she was approaching 20 years as an actress, so even during the script reading, her gestures were dignified.</p>

<p>“This is troubling.”</p>

<p>She behaved as if she was looking at a watch. The message conveyed to the audience was that there was not much time left.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m late on the first day. What am I going to tell the teacher?”</p>

<p>A girl approached her, who was lost in thought. In the drama, the girl is dressed in a gender-neutral outfit, and the scene changes to a first-person perspective to create an androgenous-like image, but right now, she only looks like a cute and lovely girl.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, I wasn’t supposed to be able to see it.</p>

<p>“Sensei. Are you lost?”</p>

<p>Calm breathing. A boy soprano, one tone lower than her usual voice. Is she adjusting her tone and diction to make it difficult to understand the characteristic lisp of children? <span id='easy-footnote-3-18178' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18178' title='Flowingcloud: This one is confusing if you don’t quite understand.

In Japanese, children&amp;#8217;s lisps are especially prevalent in speaking, thus, Tsugumi speaks in a more lisp-like way as she normally speaks with perfect enunciation (since this is just a fantasy novel in the end).'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>The tone of her voice, her gestures, and her quickly styled hair made her seem less like a girl.</p>

<p>“Y-Yes. Are you a student here?”</p>
<p>“The school building is over there. You’ll know where the staff room is when you walk down the first floor.”</p>
<p>“U-Um?”</p>
<p>“But, be careful.”</p>

<p>Take one step. Bend your knees and move with your feet without changing the position of your head. This movement, with the perfectly coordinated weight shift, gives the viewer the impression that you were floating.</p>
<p>—It was a technique that “she” was very good at.</p>
<p>No way, I shook my head. It can&#8217;t be. First of all, she had even often said, “Hard work 70 percent, talent 30 percent.” She was a hardworking person who had gone through blood-soaked training and used her monstrous mental strength to overcome anything. This girl, however, was probably the genius-type—a person who could handle her superhuman-like talents with her superior sense.</p>
<p>Her technique should not be difficult for that sort of body. Perhaps, she had seen one of her movies and had been practicing, or maybe to begin with, she had trained in martial arts.</p>

<p>“—”</p>
<p>“Over there are demons, the dwelling of evil spirits.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t pay attention, you’ll be eaten by a sca~ry ghost.”</p>

<p>Aikawa-kun diverted her gaze. From her point of view, it would seem as if she suddenly disappeared from her field of vision, which she returned back to immediately. It was because she went into her blind spot soundlessly the moment she sensed her gaze looking away for a second.</p>
<p>It was completely unbelievable. I was beyond saving, as I kept putting her and this girl together. At least, it was hard to say that “she” was a person overflowing with talent.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I was surprised.”</p>
<p>After the scene, Tsukishiro-kun murmured as he watched the director give his thoughts on the two.</p>
<p>“Are child actors these days this capable?”</p>
<p>“Well, Yoruhata-kun’s son gave a green, but splendid performance.”</p>
<p>“He&#8217;s thirteen, isn&#8217;t he? It&#8217;s scary to think what she&#8217;ll be like when she&#8217;s around that age.”</p>
<p>“I wonder. Even if she is a prodigy now, she might be a genius at that time.”</p>
<p>“Once you hit twenty, you&#8217;re just an ordinary person, is it?” <span id='easy-footnote-4-18178' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18178' title='Flowingcloud: “When you&amp;#8217;re ten, they call you a prodigy. When you&amp;#8217;re fifteen, they call you a genius. Once you hit twenty, you&amp;#8217;re just an ordinary person.” This is a very famous Japanese saying that some may know from Free! (the swimming anime) which they are clearly referring to.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>“Haha, maybe so.”</p>
<p>Even as he was chatting, the passion in Tsukishiro-kun&#8217;s eyes had not disappeared. He was a man of three faces: the surface of his acting was like ice, like a flower in his private life, and like a blaze in his true nature. He was greedier than anyone else in his quest to reach the summit of the acting world. To him, he had decided that the young girl with the same name as her had the qualifications to stand shoulder-to-shoulder beside him.</p>
<p>Ahh, but as far as I was concerned, it was the same for me. A child of this age can be difficult to deal with when performing together. “Sakura” from the past was a different story though.</p>
<p>However, if it was that girl, at least, there would be little chance to complain about her performance. She seemed to be kept in a cage, so I am worried about her physical strength though.</p>
<p>I wonder why. I wondered why I was getting so fired up. When was the last time? Ahh, that’s right, it has been a while since I have last heard her name. Maybe I was reminded of that day.</p>

<p>“Do you have any dreams for the future?”</p>
<p>“How about you? Do you have one, Kakinuma-san?”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t reply to a question with a question&#8230; Of course, I want to stand at the top of the acting world.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, my dream can coexist with yours.”</p>
<p>“Coexist?”</p>
<p>“Yes! At any rate, my dream is to strike fear into the hearts of people in Hollywood!”</p>
<p>“Ha-hahahahaha! What’s with that?! Ahh, okay, fine. I&#8217;ll star in your horror film and win the Best Actor award.”</p>
<p>“That sounds great! It’s a promise then, Kakinuma-san!”</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll still be frightening people in the afterlife. I wonder what she would say if she saw me. I&#8217;m sure she would sigh in disappointment, then come back to scare me with all she can. After all, I&#8217;ve even had nightmares from her acting as an evil spirit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of any evil spirit as sincere as you, as passionate as you, and as terrifying as you. I will no longer act in a way that will make you feel sorry for me.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s your turn, Kakinuma-san.”</p>

<p>Her provocative smile burned into the back of my eyelids. Her life as an actor had been lacking in some respects, but it would be interesting to see her come back.</p>
<p>“Kakinuma-san?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;—Ahh, I&#8217;m sorry. It&#8217;s nothing.”</p>
<p>The next scene is with me and the girl. It was the scene where the principal, Kinukata Kozo, calls out to Hiiragi Lily. Kinukata was indirectly involved in the incident that caused Hiiragi to break down, and for that reason, he feels guilty. As a teacher, he was torn between his sense of justice, his fear of losing his position as principal, and his feelings of guilt towards the girl. Thus, he tolerated anything, no matter what happened. He does not operate for justice, but neither does he move for evil. That&#8217;s what kind of human he is.</p>
<p>In this scene, his stance of not condoning bullying, but not overlooking it either is depicted.</p>
<p>“Well then, let&#8217;s start. Scene—”</p>
<p>Three girls were in conflict. The three girls were Yoruhata-kun’s daughter, a bullying victim who was not a major character within the selected child actors, and a young girl… Sorahoshi, Tsugumi-kun. She played a mysterious girl who was boyish and attractive in some regards. I was looking forward to seeing what kind of villain she would show us, which is unsuitable for her age.</p>
<p>“—start.”</p>
<p>Director Hiraga&#8217;s voice. His well-conveyed voice flipped the switch of our consciousness. In front of us, there were three girls. From the circumstances, I could instantly guess what was going on.</p>

<p>“What are you guys doing?”</p>

<p>Well now, what kind of performance will you show this old man? What would a lisping kid, a preschooler child actor, show us right after their mischievous performance earlier?</p>
<p>That’s right. As if mocking me for being halfheartedly in the performance, her pupils similar to glass marbles pierced towards me.</p>

<p>“We were just playing. Right?”</p>
<p>“Eek.”</p>

<p>The girl playing the victim exclaimed softly as her shoulders jolted. It was splendid acting. However, it was not her true ability. She was being engulfed by the strange atmosphere and was being forced to act.</p>
<p>The girl who was at the heart of the matter was not Sorahoshi Tsugumi, who came to greet us. Instead, it was Hiiragi Lily, whose personality development materialized into evil itself due to an incident.</p>

<p>“Sensei. You get it, right? We were just playing.”</p>
<p>“A-Ahh. Is that so? But, it&#8217;s already late today. Go home before it gets dark.”</p>
<p>“Okaaay. Let’s go, Kaede-chan.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Okay.”</p>

<p>Akimi Kaede, played by Rin—Yoruhata-kun’s daughter—nodded as she looked at Lily and me with concern. Lily quietly walked away, leaving the victim&#8217;s child behind, then turned around and looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>“See you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing.</p>
<p>Nothing was fun.</p>
<p>Nothing made her happy.</p>
<p>Only to destroy and protect.</p>
<p>Only to love and snatch away.</p>
<p>A strong message struck through her eyes.</p>
<p>“Cut. As expected, good work.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Kakinuma-san?”</p>
<p>“It seems like I wasn&#8217;t quite as warmed up like everyone else. I&#8217;m quite embarrassed. I&#8217;m sure I can do better next time.”</p>
<p>“Even better than that? However, that was very lifelike. You conveyed your perplexing feeling.”</p>
<p>Director Hiraga&#8217;s words were eye-opening. What came next was a flame that I had almost forgotten. I had no intention of acting perplexed. Nevertheless, if those around me could feel it, then there was no mistaking it.</p>
<p>I was forced to act. That little girl made me act.</p>
<p>“Looks like I’ve lost my energy. Heh-heh.”</p>
<p>“K-Kakinuma-san?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, no, it&#8217;s nothing.”</p>
<p>I will only thank you for now. After this, I will have to apologize at your grave. It seems that I have not yet fulfilled the promise I made with you.</p>

<p>Hinomoto Television, Hallway (Evening)<br />
Tsugumi, who was going home, calls out to Koharu.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>After the script reading ended without any issues, we reviewed our future, then everyone decided to break up. I was actually planning to go home with Rin-chan, but she stared at her cell phone screen with a scowl, then apologized, telling me that she had an urgent matter to attend to. Because of that, I replied back telling her not to mind.</p>
<p>Since I had some free time on my hands, I asked for the staff&#8217;s permission to explore and at least memorize the layout of the TV station.</p>
<p>“Koharu-san, have you already memorized everything?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I am good at remembering directions.”</p>
<p>“From bird watching?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Occasionally, I go camping to watch them.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>You have various things memorized, huh?</p>
<p>As I was admiring her, my ears suddenly picked up some sort of sound. I pulled Koharu-san&#8217;s sleeve to stop her, then she tilted her head in puzzlement from the sound as well.</p>
<p>“Is it the conference room?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it certainly is.”</p>
<p>I was a little curious, or rather, interested, so I tried to approach the door.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>An argument? Is there a meeting?</p>
<p>No, this is different. This is something even more familiar to me.</p>
<p>“Koharu-san, shhh.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>I put my finger to my lips and moved there with Koharu-san. Rather, you can walk without making any sounds even though you haven’t trained in acting, huh, Koharu-san.</p>
<p>We quietly made it down the hallway, then slowly turned the doorknob—just a tiny bit—and peeked in.</p>
<p>If I’m not mistaken, from the nature of their voices—</p>
<p>“Okay, then, let’s do my line one more time, got it?”</p>
<p>—Bingo. Like I thought, they were practicing by themselves.</p>
<p>(&#8230;Rin-chan’s one of them. Then… who’s the other?)</p>
<p>As I got closer, I noticed one of the voices was a female voice that I was familiar with. It was Rin-chan’s, who I parted from earlier. Then, who was the other person? I secretly shifted my gaze with that in mind.</p>
<p>Their hair was glossy black, and their eyes were black-ish, though I couldn&#8217;t see the exact color of them clearly. Judging from his build, he was definitely male, but his strikingly beautiful features made the line between male and female seem ambiguous. He was a beautiful, androgynous, pretty boy. Could this be the “older brother” that Rin-chan talked about before?</p>

<p>“Why aren&#8217;t you crying?”</p>

<p>A single phrase.</p>
<p>I could hear him gulp as he said those words. Koharu-san, who was watching with me, trembled at his statement.</p>
<p>His face looked like he was holding back pain. His voice trembled and creaked, and he seemed to be on the verge of screaming. That one statement could affect the world, distort reality, and evoke illusions. It was as if, that’s right, as if she was “Sakura-chan” from the old days.</p>

<p>“That&#8217;s a strange thing to say. If I cry, will the two of you come back?”</p>

<p>Rin-chan, on the other hand, was also very good at acting. Her expression was as if she was smiling while crying. Her eyes were devoid of emotion. Rin-chan&#8217;s father and brother were both actors, and her mother, who was an announcer that was required to speak smoothly and has a wide lexicon, was more skillful than an unskilled actor.</p>
<p>Rin-chan must have been exposed to the world of acting from an even younger age. An ephemeral performance as if she was a different person. Maybe there was a difference in experience, but the boy was extraordinary.</p>

<p>“Cry. If you don’t cry now, you&#8217;ll surely… you’ll never be able to really cry again!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Even though they died because I cried?”</p>
<p>“It was an accident! It&#8217;s not your fault. It&#8217;s not… your fault. You don&#8217;t have to blame yourself! …Cry. It&#8217;s okay to cry (to be forgiven).”</p>

<p>A cry that sounded as if it was coming from a second voice. I&#8217;m sure the viewers will put various expressions on this one line. It could be forgiveness, salvation, or possibly, anger. It has the power to make one feel that way.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s watch more modern dramas and movies. I&#8217;m sure that in the past twenty years, there have been a lot of great performances shown to the world. Good acting that invoked a strong desire.</p>

<p>“I’m—ah.”</p>
<p>“—Hm? What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Tsugumi!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Ah, she noticed me.</p>
<p>My eyes met Rin-chan&#8217;s during her performance, and she cut her act and ran to me. She looked so adorable, like a puppy, but I felt guilty towards the boy.</p>
<p>“Sorry for peeping.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. If it’s you, Tsugumi, you can have the box seat. Is that okay? Brother.”</p>
<p>“Haa? What are you talking about? Of course it’s not—”</p>
<p>As the young boy attempted to speak, she stopped suddenly as he looked at me. Seeing that, Rin-chan smiled and called the boy out without a moment&#8217;s delay.</p>
<p>“Brother, you’re looking at Tsugumi too much, even if she’s cute.”</p>
<p>“Don’t—no, that’s not—”</p>
<p>“Are you saying she’s not cute?”</p>
<p>“I didn&#8217;t say that! That’s not it! Hey, you!”</p>
<p>The boy pointed at me as if shaking off her influence.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the one, right? The one Rin called an “acting genius”.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I said that. Do you get it now, Brother?”</p>
<p>“You went through them in detail, Rin.”</p>
<p>Well, I understand that.</p>
<p>The boy perked up his shoulders and spoke in a tone unimaginable from his angel-like looks.</p>
<p>“So, you. If you feel bad about peeping, you should keep me company with the script reading.”</p>
<p>“Keep me company… that sounds lewd, Brother.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant. Don’t pinpoint that part only.</p>
<p>They’re close, aren’t they… wait, this isn’t the time to be impressed.</p>
<p>“Um, sorry for peeping in!”</p>
<p>“I am sorry, Yoruhata-sama. I&#8217;m the manager, the one responsible for this.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, cut it. I don&#8217;t care about responsibility or that sort. I just want to see what she&#8217;s capable of.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>He’s a person who speaks their mind quite clearly. To be honest, I have a favorable impression of him. And as an actor, my spirit quivered from the first “challenge” I had received in this life.</p>
<p>This was something that had happened to me in my previous life. A child of a single parent. A child who ran away from her parents. A child who rose to fame only due to her misfortune. At the filming scene, at the audition, on the sage, and behind the camera, numerous people fought against my spirit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t underestimate those who challenge me just because they were children. That is the worst thing I could ever do after all.</p>
<p>“By all means, I will be in your care.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. You’ve got some guts, don’t you? Rin.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. Tsugumi, I&#8217;m not going to upload it, but I’m going to film this for reference, okay?”</p>
<p>“Well then, Rin-sama. May I, the unworthy Mikado Koharu, accept this important role?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Upload? I wonder what “upload” means. Well, it should be fine since Koharu-san didn’t stop her.</p>
<p>“Which scene?”</p>
<p>“It’s this script. Not the scene that Rin did at first but this one here.”</p>
<p>I see. A girl, whose parents were killed in an accident due to her own selfishness, has closed her heart. This was the scene that Rin-chan was playing earlier where the boy meets the girl and wants to help her by breaking into her heart. In the script, the timeline is after that.</p>
<p>The girl, Rena, has her heart slightly melted by the words of the boy, Shou, which had been hardened like ice. This all collapsed in the worst possible way when her aunt Asako, who missed her parents, said, “I wish you didn’t exist.”</p>
<p>The rooftop of an apartment building. Rena is about to jump off. Shou stops Rena, who is prepared to die.</p>
<p>“Well then, Rin. Please give us the signal.”</p>
<p>“I’ll show you the true ability of a great director.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t do anything unnecessary, okay?”</p>

<p>Guilt.</p>
<p>Sentiment towards her parents.</p>
<p>Fear towards her aunt.</p>
<p>The mere feeling of hope towards the youth.</p>
<p>The simmering hatred towards herself.</p>

<p>“Scene—Action!”</p>

<p>My violent emotions burst forth, overflowing like it was burning my heart.</p>

<p>“Hey, what are you doing over—”</p>
<p>“Don’t come!!”</p>
<p>“—”</p>

<p>That’s why, please.</p>
<p>Please ignore (abandon) me.</p>

<hr />
<p>Hinomoto Television, Meeting Room (Evening)<br />
Rin’s older brother, Kou stares at Tsugumi who was holding the script.</p>
<hr />

<p>Her silver hair swayed. Her blue eyes looked straight ahead. Her looks were unexpectedly familiar for someone whose outward appearance makes me think of another country. I forgot to blink due to all of her molded into this divinely arranged, unworldly beauty.</p>
<p>—which is something I won’t say due to her being annoying. I definitely won’t say this to that peeping little girl.</p>
<p>“Which scene?”</p>
<p>I was so angry at the little girl who accepted Yoruhata Kou’s challenge as if it was nothing. What is it? Do you really plan on standing toe-to-toe with me? What a joke. Rin’s cheeky gaze put an end to these rambling thoughts.</p>
<p>I get it. Ahh, I get it. No matter where you go in this world, one’s ability is everything. If I challenge her to a challenge that measures her ability, I’ll put a stop to this.</p>
<p>“It’s this script. Not the scene that Rin did at first but this one here.”</p>
<p>She read the script with a lax look on her face, then, of all things, she slammed it closed. Did she memorize it? Did she have an eidetic memory? Just that might make me relatively jealous.</p>
<p>No, no, what am I talking about? There&#8217;s no way I’d be jealous. Even I could do that if I tried. Surely I could.</p>
<p>“Brother?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s nothing.”</p>
<p>I shook my head horizontally at Rin&#8217;s small, quizzical voice. Don&#8217;t mind it. All the nonsense and noise is unnecessary for me now.</p>
<p>Imagine it. I am a boy who&#8217;s in love with a girl several years apart. She was like a sister to me, but she&#8217;s now grown up. I am Shou, the boy who has sworn to protect her, but hates himself for his worthlessness. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18179' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18179' title='Flowingcloud: When my man said, “イメージしろ (image-shiro),” I actually cringed inside so hard. This reminds me of Kai from Cardfight Vanguard. This is his second most well-known catchphrase from the anime (the most being “Final Turn!”).'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>“Well then, Rin. Please give us the signal.”</p>
<p>“I’ll show you the true ability of a great director.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t do anything unnecessary, okay?”</p>
<p>Immerse myself.</p>
<p>Script reading? Screw that. This isn&#8217;t some sort of cheap place. This is a place spirits and spirits clash—a place for serious acting.</p>
<p>The rooftop.</p>
<p>Rena is standing there.</p>
<p>I caught up to her.</p>
<p>“Scene—Action!”</p>
<p>The girl’s trembling back, as she was about to throw herself off, froze my heart.</p>

<p>“Hey, what are you doing over—”</p>
<p>“Don’t come!!”</p>
<p>“—”</p>

<p>Her voice blurred from her tears. The atmosphere trembled and l froze from her seriousness.</p>

<p>“What did you come here for? Leave me alone!”</p>
<p>“No! Let’s go home, Rena! Do you think this is going to make aunty and uncle happy?”</p>
<p>“Aunty Asako will be happy.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>

<p>If only you had never been born.</p>
<p>I certainly did see the moment when these sharp words pierced Rena. Even though I saw it, I couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>Rena’s sneer must have been targeting herself. But for some reason, those words pierced me as if it was directed at me.</p>

<p>“Hey, that&#8217;s enough, isn&#8217;t it? Why don&#8217;t you just let me go back to my mom and dad?”</p>
<p>“Do you really think you&#8217;ll see them if you commit suicide?”</p>
<p>“Ah, hahahaha, I know. They don&#8217;t want to meet the people who killed them!”</p>

<p>An influx of images. A broken down white-walled apartment building that smelled of paint.</p>
<p>No, no, no, there aren’t such buildings these days. It must be a well-maintained concrete building.</p>
<p>The image that flowed into me was like dealing with an adult, like a child who is about to cry. The newborn embryo had matured… that’s not it!</p>

<p>What is it? Why is it so disjointed? Whatever, shake it off and take a step forward.</p>

<p>“They don’t want to see you? Don’t make me laugh! They were going to go to Rena because they loved you so much. If you deny that, you&#8217;ll be denying the hearts of those two…”</p>
<p>“—That’s…”</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s go home. You&#8217;re going to catch a cold. Let&#8217;s go home, Rena—!”</p>
<p>“N-No, don&#8217;t come!”</p>

<p>Shaking her head in refusal, Rena&#8217;s feet took a step off from the roof of the building. It was not a deliberate attempt to suicide. It was an unexpected accident caused by her agitation. Just as her young body was about to be thrown into the air and begin to naturally fall, Rena smiled as if relieved.</p>
<p>That’s why I ran. I won’t let her feel relieved. I won’t let aunty’s and uncle&#8217;s love, and my feelings, go to waste. I made it in time and grabbed the cold, trembling hand.</p>

<p>“Wh…y?”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re going to die. Don&#8217;t die! I—I don&#8217;t want Rena to die.”</p>
<p>“Why, why… uwahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!”</p>

<p>I hugged her little head. Only the realization that the warmth had not disappeared kept me from crying.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18187" src="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00055-210x300.jpeg" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00055-210x300.jpeg 210w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00055-717x1024.jpeg 717w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00055-768x1097.jpeg 768w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00055-1075x1536.jpeg 1075w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00055.jpeg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 85vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>“Cut!”</p>
<p>The voice.</p>
<p>The sound.</p>
<p>The color.</p>
<p>I came back to myself at the sight of our eyes meeting.</p>
<p>“How long are you going to hug her? Brother.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, don&#8217;t worry about it.”</p>
<p>This is the first time. For the first time, our worlds intersected. That moment, I was certainly “Shou”. It was strangely frustrating that I had to take him out by this odd person.</p>
<p>“Wai… it’s a draw this time.”</p>
<p>“Errr, sure.”</p>
<p>“What is it? You&#8217;re being pretty meek. You accepted my challenge so easily.”</p>
<p>Sorahoshi Tsugumi nodded in a somewhat puzzled voice. What’s with her? Out with it.</p>
<p>“Well, hmm.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so indecisive. If you have something to say, how about you say it?”</p>
<p>When I asked this, Rin, who was beside me for some reason, sighed.</p>
<p>“You mean separate (hanase), Brother.”</p>
<p>“Tell me (hanase)&#8230; separate (hanase)? Ah, my bad!” <span id='easy-footnote-2-18179' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18179' title='Flowingcloud: Talk/tell/speak all is “hanase” (plain form in “hanasu”) which is a homophone of to separate/divide/part (hanase).'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>My younger sister pointed out that we were still embracing each other closely, then we separated and I apologized. Is this a skit!? When I separated from her in a fluster, Sorahoshi Tsgumi scratched her cheek and returned to normal.</p>
<p>Guh… it’s somewhat vexing.</p>
<p>“T-That’s all for today. Let’s go, Rin!”</p>
<p>“Ah, sure. Well then, Tsugumi, see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah. See you tomorrow!”</p>
<p>I grabbed Rin, who was waving carefreely, and left the meeting room. As I walked with my shoulders perked up, Rin half ran beside me, then I matched her pace, remembering my mother&#8217;s teachings.</p>
<p>“How was it?”</p>
<p>“Hah. If it’s just that, then it’ll be an easy victory for me.”</p>
<p>“If it’s just that?”</p>
<p>“If it was just that part.”</p>
<p>How should I put it, if I seriously performed, I understood slightly. There’s this something slightly off, rather mismatched. It’s hard to put it in words.</p>
<p>“What if you lost to her in that state?”</p>
<p>“Lose? Hmph, that’s—”</p>

<p>It would be certain that a monster would be born.</p>
<p>I swallowed the words that were about to unintentionally come out of my mouth. I shook my head cursing her and telling her “it’s nothing” as she just tilted her head in puzzlement.\</p>

<p>Lowell Residence (Evening)<br />
After returning home, Tsugumi plunges into her father’s chest.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>When I came home from the first meetup, I was greeted by my smiling parents. I jumped into the warmth of their gentle bodies, and as my tall father picked me up, my field of vision broadened.</p>
<p>“I became friends with Rin’s older brother.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see, I see. My angel is a genius at making friends, huh?”</p>
<p>“Ara ara.” <span id='easy-footnote-1-18180' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18180' title='Flowingcloud: Ara ara mom at it again.&lt;br /&gt;
Arocks141: Ara ara.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>A gentle smile. Gentle words. When I take into consideration that these were directed to me as their daughter—as parents and child, I felt uneasy.</p>
<p>“I thought Tsugumi might want to watch some movies and dramas as part of your acting studies, so I&#8217;ve prepared a theater room, so let’s watch them together later.”</p>
<p>“Really? I&#8217;m so happy!”</p>
<p>“When you were younger, we used to watch fairy tales and theater masterpieces together.”</p>
<p>“Ehh! I don&#8217;t remember.”</p>
<p>I sorta remember, but I sorta don’t remember? Also, I&#8217;m happy—I’m happy, but what&#8217;s a theater room?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect they would prepare something like a small movie theater and I was busy trying to hold back the cringe from my face.<span id='easy-footnote-2-18180' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18180' title='Arocks141: The text says ‘cramp on’ and not ‘cringe from’&amp;#8230; But we all know how things really are.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“Tsugumi, let&#8217;s go see a play sometime. If you find a theater troupe you like, shall we invite them?”</p>
<p>“That’s a good idea! As expected of my goddess. What were we talking about again?”</p>
<p>Inviting a theater troupe… Errrr, how am I supposed to stop this? Aren’t you spoiling your daughter a bit too much here?</p>
<p>“Daddy, Mommy, um…”</p>
<p>“Hm? Ahh, that’s right. Do you want to sleep with us today?”</p>
<p>“Ah—S-Sure.”</p>
<p>I was looking for words to stop him, but perhaps I was too tired, but I obediently nodded my head to my father&#8217;s words. Putting my body aside, even though my mental age was 30 years old, I still wanted to sleep together with my parents!</p>
<p>My father&#8217;s big hand gently stroked my hand to calm me down as I tried to have it take his hand off my head in a fluster.</p>
<p>“Would Tsugumi’s room be fine?”</p>
<p>“Haha, it’s a little too small, Dear. Shall we sleep in our own room?”</p>
<p>“I like that. Then, let’s have Haruna burn some aromatherapy oils.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Then, let&#8217;s have Koharu-san bring Tsugumi&#8217;s stuffed animal as well.”</p>
<p>When I was a child, I longed for my own room. If I had a space to myself, I thought I could escape from my father, who was a violent drunk.</p>
<p>However, in reality, I dreamed of sleeping in the shape of ‘川’ with my parents. I fantasized about how happy I would be just to have them both looking at me and calling out to me gently, and then, the reality came before me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never experienced anything like this. I’ve never experienced anything so warm. Even though I’ve never experienced it, now, I&#8217;m puzzled by how much I can surely experience it as much as I want.</p>
<p>As a horror actress, Kirio Tsugumi was highly praised for her hungry, mad love acting.</p>
<p>I am now just a child that is growing up enveloped in love.</p>
<p>(How can I respond to both of their love?)</p>
<p>I know how to act that way, but I don&#8217;t know how to behave like a spoiled child. I felt that the boundary between the Tsugumi living in the past, and Tsugumi living in the present, was slightly shaken.</p>

<p>Kakinuma Residence (Night)<br />
Kakinuma sets his smartphone on speakerphone and leaves it on top of the desk, then he sits down on his sofa.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“Ahh, hello. It’s me.”</p>
<p>“That’s rare of Uncle to call me.”</p>
<p>“Am I really that lazy?”</p>
<p>“That’s not it, but you’re busy, right? After all, you’re the great actor, Kakinuma Souzou.”</p>
<p>“Stop it. I have just personally experienced my immaturity.”</p>
<p>In a room in my house, I talked on my smartphone. The person on the other end of the line was my nephew ages apart from each other. He, too, followed the same path as I did, and oddly enough, has become popular and he has a similar appearance to me when I was younger. This popularity is not only due to his lineage or appearance. He has more talent than I did when I was young, and he was just as greedy as I was back then.</p>
<p>The last time I saw him was two years ago; when he was only sixteen years old. He looked more sophisticated on TV, but I wonder how he would when we meet up in person. I&#8217;m looking forward to that time.</p>
<p>“&#8230;That really is rare. Did you become timid? Stop it. Uncle, you’re my goal.”</p>
<p>“It’s easier for you to surpass me now, right?”</p>
<p>“If you really think so, please tell me that in a non-ambitious tone. What is it? Don’t tell me you called because you’re full of ambition after something happened. Haa… my goal got further away again.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, isn’t it worth it though?”</p>
<p>My nephew’s intimate sigh was somewhat comforting. It was hard for me to lose focus, since he had set his sights on an old man like me. He was born two years after she had passed away, and he was also my hope. My sister, several years apart, gave birth to him in exchange for her life.</p>
<p>However, in hindsight, I may have been naive. If I hadn&#8217;t been remonstrated in such a way by a child with the same name as hers, I wouldn&#8217;t have realized that I had lost my energy.</p>
<p>“So, what are you calling for?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nothing much. A project within my group of friends got brought up. I wanted to invite you—as a competent actor.”</p>
<p>“Is that sarcasm?”</p>
<p>“Heh heh heh, It’s not. I meant it.”</p>
<p>“Tsk, just you wait and see before long… And, the project?”</p>
<p>I opened my diary and scrutinized the regrets from that day. In fact, I was thinking about refusing. However, today, on my way home from work, I contacted my friends and decided to act. It was because I felt like she would laugh at me if I held on to my regrets.</p>
<p>“Do you remember a movie called “Saya”?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;You’re bringing this up even though it’s traumatic for you?”</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m glad you seem to remember.”</p>
<p>“Saya”. Saya, a girl who lost her life due to bullying, roamed about the school as a ghost. One day, Saya, who was supposed to have disappeared with deep sorrow and loneliness, meets a girl who can see her. The lonely girl, Sae, and the ghost, Saya, become friends and deepen their bond as if their harmony was pre-established. However, on the day of Sae&#8217;s graduation ceremony, she encountered a random attacker who broke her heart, and she became like a doll. A few years later, at a class reunion, Saya—sunken deep into sadness—learned the truth about Sae&#8217;s assault by a classmate. Having her best friend best, Saya becomes an evil spirit and takes revenge on Sae&#8217;s former classmates. <span id='easy-footnote-3-18180' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18180' title='Flowingcloud: Fun philosophical theory. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-established_harmony&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>“We’re remaking “Saya”.”</p>
<p>“Huh? No, but, isn’t the leading actor—”</p>
<p>“That’s right. It’s Kirio Tsugumi—the legendary actress.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, that’s right, the reason why Uncle has remained single.”</p>
<p>“Kai.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, you don&#8217;t have to be so serious and angry… Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Good grief.”</p>
<p>The first half was about a lonely, kind-hearted female ghost. The second half was about an evil, terrifying, sorrowful evil spirit. It was a horror movie where the duality of the characters creates fear, and the scene in which Saki, the main character and sister of the assailant, gets caught up in the whirlpool of fear was so terrifying that there was no end to the number of children who started crying when it was broadcast on television.</p>
<p>At the time, she was often used for her dual nature themes because of her previous hit, and this was the work that made the “horror” of her dual nature be known. Therefore, in foreign reviews, those who prefer “the abyss of evil”, which displayed her performance of deep love, call her a “ghost”. However, those who prefer “Saya”, which showed the madness of love, call her an “evil spirit”.</p>
<p>There has not been a suitable role for this child actor and he has been wandering here and there, but… he might manage one way or another. That was one of the reasons I decided to take part.</p>
<p>“Well, sure. Of course, the role I’m playing is Endou Hiroki, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Are you worried?”</p>
<p>“You’re joking… I’ll make them say that my acting was better than yours.”</p>
<p>“Heh, I’ll be waiting.”</p>
<p>At that time, I played the role of Endou Hiroshi, a detective hired by the assailant. Now, my nephew will play the role. This could be said to be the perfect stage to make a break with the naive idea of leaving it to the younger generation.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s been twenty years since you left this world. I won&#8217;t let anyone tell me that these twenty years were days of nothingness anymore.)</p>
<p>I finished my call and put my smartphone down on the desk, then I stared at the moonless night. When I thought of you in that night sky, strangely enough, my fighting spirit that I was convinced was all used up was boiling and overflowing.</p>
