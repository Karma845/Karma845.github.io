<h3>Theater 3</h3>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 1</strong></p>

<p>Rindou Affiliated Elementary School, Reception Room (Day)<br />
Documents are spread on the desk for Tsugumi’s mother, and Tsugumi is observing.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>—Rindou Affiliated Private Elementary School</p>
<p>It was a prestigious school that has produced or supported the activities of many celebrities. II did not know of this institution unrelated to me in my previous life, but among the students that were raised here, I knew quite a few people from my previous life. I looked at the list of graduates, which was displaying the person’s identity clearly, and my eyes followed the names I knew.</p>
<p>There were students in the elementary school section that had been child actors at the time. I knew some of the names listed as well. Excluding Sakura-chan, whose acting was outstanding even though she didn&#8217;t go to a specialized school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see the V-cinema actress Kusunoki Oza is on the list. Here, Tsugumi.” <span id='easy-footnote-1-18460' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18460' title='Flowingcloud: Direct-to-video is referred to as V-cinema in Japan. I included the link for those zoomers who don’t know what direct-to-video is. There’s a “V-Cinema” section in there as well for those who want to read up a little on it.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>“You’re right!”</p>
<p>“I also heard she appeared in a horror movie… but I don’t know too much about it.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi-chan and your mother both have refined tastes.”</p>
<p>The famous V-cinema actor, Kusunoki Oza, and her sworn younger brother, Koda Riku, were famous. They are both in their sixties now, right? I miss those actors. If I remember correctly, they co-starred in a horror movie about the yakuza. Kusunoki-san looked better with a dagger than a pistol, and Koda-san was very good at playing the role of her younger brother.</p>
<p>In the work where she co-stars with Kirio Tsugumi, Koda-san comes to the prison to pick up Kusunoki-san to celebrate her release from prison, but he suddenly became delirious and shot Kusunoki-san dead. The person who cursed Koda-san at that time was none other than me, Kirio Tsugumi.</p>
<p>As I recall, she must have been a child actor at that time. As I was thinking about it, I checked the elementary school section graduation list, but I couldn&#8217;t find the name I had in mind.</p>
<p>(I hope you&#8217;re doing well, Sara-chan.)</p>
<p>In a film at that time—Tomb of the Dragon, Itsuko, Kabura Sosaburo’s wife (Kabura is played by Kusunoki-san), was poisoned to death by Kabura&#8217;s mistress, Minori. It was a conspiracy by Kabura, who wanted Minori as his wife even though he could not kill Itsuko—the daughter of the previous leader of the clan—who became an evil spirit and cursed them to death. At this time, Minori’s daughter, Rumiko, was played by Sara-chan. Sara-chan was a child actor who splendidly performed the role of the villain, and received high praise for her performance.</p>
<p>She left the world of acting for a while due to family reasons, but later returned. I never got to meet her after her return in the end.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, are you tired?”</p>
<p>“Nope, Daddy. I&#8217;m fine!”</p>
<p>When I replied to my father, he smiled and said, “Is that so?” as he picked me up. He must have thought I was tired since I was so absent-minded. I tend to get lost in thought. Gotta be careful.</p>
<p>“There is a salon for the students. It is open to visitors, so how about you take a little break?”</p>
<p>“Let’s see, Tsugumi, how about it?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Thanks Daddy.”</p>
<p>My father picked me up and took me to the so-called salon. Rather, what is a salon for students? I&#8217;m sure the tuition is quite expensive here, though it’s too late to think about it now.</p>
<p>“—This way.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>The salon was adjacent to the botanical garden (even though the garden is inside a building!) it seems, and on the other side of the frosted glass, there were flowers, trees, and even birds spreading their wings. In the center of the dome-shaped space was a white antique table and chairs. The space was soundproofed, so it seemed that students use this space to practice acting, rest, study for exams, and bring food to eat. Depending on the student, their servants were even permitted to enter… this kind of sounds like elegant tea breaks of the rich, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>I slipped out of my father&#8217;s hands and quietly approached Koharu-san, who was following me. When my parents are around, you don’t have much presence, huh, Koharu-san? Rin-chan didn&#8217;t even notice you.</p>
<p>“Koharu-san.”</p>
<p>“How can I help you, Tsugumi-sama?”</p>
<p>“You can do some bird watching, you know?”</p>
<p>I am taking a break after all. As I told her while giving a few tugs on Koharu-san’s sleeve, shook her head as she smiled—her expression almost never changes.</p>
<p>“No, I am fine. I am filled with an inexpressible feeling just by watching Tsugumi-sama, the birds, and the flowers.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re exaggerating. But, let me know when you want to take a break.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand. I am having a blissful time, thus there is no need to worry about me, and I am fine.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>I nodded to Koharu-san, then returned to my parents. My mother took me by the hand and gently caressed me as I sat down on the tall chair.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a gift to be able to pay attention to others. You’re such a sweet girl, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“You are indeed our angel. Good girl. But, you must not forget to put yourself first. Okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>Like I thought, they were good parents. I wish my parents from my previous life would take a lesson from them. As my parents proceeded with the conversation, my job was to listen to the conversation with the president while relishing the tea and cookies in front of me.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi-chan, do you plan to pursue a career in theater?”</p>
<p>“Actually, her debut as a child actor has already been decided.”</p>
<p>“Oh my! I will be sure to watch the program on the day it airs.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am sure that will make Tsugumi very happy.”</p>
<p>Listening to the conversation between my father and the president, I drank the tea that Koharu-san had prepared for me. Occasionally, I would eat a cookie that my mother offered me, feeling embarrassed, and before I knew it, my father had joined the group. Stop it, I’m going to get fat.</p>

<p>“—Well then, it’s about time we go.”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, did you find out more about your school?”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’m looking forward to it!”</p>
<p>“Haha, good girl.”</p>
<p>They left the salon and had one last administrative talk. We were about to enter the reception room together when I suddenly felt a gaze piercing my skin.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>When I turned around, it was Rin-chan&#8217;s brother, Kou-kun, in his lesson clothes sticking to them as he was walking with his friend.</p>
<p>He wiped his sweat off his face with a white towel and talked to his friend with a serious expression. Was it feedback for today? I would use the words enthusiastic to describe him, indicating that I don’t know much about him yet.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re still here.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Kou-kun.”</p>
<p>“Who are you to call me Kou-kun?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, you don&#8217;t like it when my daughter calls you that?”</p>
<p>I could hear my father&#8217;s voice above me. Then, what do you think happened? Kou-kun quivered his shoulders in surprise, then looked away somewhat embarrassed. Kou-kun’s appearance is that of an angel’s, but the fact that he’s a naughty child is amusing.</p>
<p>Through my analogical reasoning, I felt that he was fundamentally a good-natured and serious person, with a touch of kindness in his bluntness. Rin-chan really has a good family. Kou-kun responded to my father’s words overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“No, it&#8217;s not like that.”</p>
<p>“I see, isn’t that great, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“Yup!”</p>
<p>“Ahh, that’s right. If you could, would you keep Tsugmi company?”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>I could not help but ask again without thinking after hearing my father&#8217;s suggestion. There’s no problem even if I’m with Koharu-san, no, even by myself.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Kou-kun thought of my confusion, but he nodded with a small sigh.</p>
<p>“Well, sure. I’m used to taking care of Rin after all.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Well then, Tsugumi, be a good girl.”</p>
<p>“O-Okay, I will! Daddy, Mommy, see you later.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we&#8217;ll see you later.”</p>
<p>…Thus, one way or another, this weird situation occurred. When I nervously looked up, I saw a boy, who was probably Kou’s friend, grabbing his shoulders and having a private conversation with him.</p>
<p>Though I should say, I wonder if they were trying to seriously hide the contents of their conversation. Their voices were quite loud, and frankly, I could hear everything perfectly.</p>
<p>“Dayumn, she’s like a fairy. Hey, Kou, where did you meet her?”</p>
<p>“She’s my sister’s friend.”</p>
<p>“Your sister’s a beauty too, you know.”</p>
<p>“Putting that aside, you good, Tanaka? You were called by Uemura, right?”</p>
<p>“Crap, you’re right. There were a lot of those idiotic problems. See you later, Fairy!”</p>
<p>“Eh, ah, bye.”</p>
<p>Having said so, Kou&#8217;s cheerful friend ran off at a brisk pace. The remaining person, Kou-kun, brought me to the bench beside a vending machine and sat down next to me.</p>
<p>“You’re peeping at me every time I see you.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for bothering you that time.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t really mind.”</p>
<p>When I bowed my head, Kou-kun scratched his cheek awkwardly. Boys at this age are somehow very awkward. I found it strangely lovely, and I found myself giggling, letting my feelings show.</p>
<p>I feel like I understand the reason why Rin-chan is attached to him, always calling him, “Brother, Brother.”</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Hey, kids shouldn&#8217;t be using honorifics.” <span id='easy-footnote-2-18460' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18460' title='Flowingcloud: I tried my best to make her sound somewhat formal, but anyway, Tsugumi defaults to honorific language whenever she speaks to someone she’s not familiar with.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“Hahaha, sure, got it.”</p>
<p>“Gosh.”</p>
<p>A sigh. Narrowed eyes. Eyes that look like the night sky peeping out from his light black hair were like a moody cat.</p>
<p>“Are girls your age this cheeky?”</p>
<p>“There are all kinds of girls.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure there are, but that’s not it. Rin is easy to understand. Is it because you’re rich? —Ah.”.</p>
<p>Kou-kun felt perplexed and tilted his head. Why’d he suddenly tilt his head in contemplation? I figured out the reason for that immediately. I must have been surely teased as a rich person, and his pangs of conscience must be at work. It would be simple to tell him to not worry about it as he was bewildered, but that seems like it would make things awkward.</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re talking to such an intelligent girl, I might as well exercise my tactfulness. Switch lightly. I pretended to wipe the sweat off my face to hide my youthfulness from my friend&#8217;s older brother.</p>
<p>“Then, if you were to strip me of my money and tiara, what would you have said to me?”</p>

<p>Line of sight. My eyes, which had been looking at the ceiling, sank as if I had come upon an idea as I looked at Kou-kun.</p>
<p>Enucation. Words that were wooing him. As if I was conveying to him that I was testing him.</p>
<p>Expression. Boredom, hogging, distorted love. How could one tell that it was still love?</p>
<p>Breath. A shallow breath means nervousness. If it were you, how would you perceive it?</p>

<p>“—Nothing.”</p>

<p>A beat. In the one breath it took to bring his gaze from the ceiling down back to me, Kou-kun understood my intent.</p>

<p>“Huh? But, you would not be able to get anything out of saying nothing. Even so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not good at putting things into words. Still, my thoughts are more plentiful than words.”</p>
<p>“Even if you were to be driven to the depths of the earth with only that truth in your heart?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Also, let me make one thing clear: Even if I am driven to a distant land, it would be because I do not have the eyes of desire and the slippery flattering, not because I have lost the truth of my love for you.”</p>

<p>The way he straightened his back, then said so in a lively manner was more mature than what his age would suggest. He immediately swallowed down the subject that contained hints of a disaster, understood my meaning, then spoke powerfully as if challenging me back.</p>
<p>I feel a little embarrassed by his brief comment. It was not him, but me, who subconsciously underestimated him deep inside.</p>
<p>At the very least, I should follow his sincere performance to the end.</p>
<p>I am an arrogant king.</p>
<p>A king who wished for words that flattered him from his children, and died in tragedy.</p>
<p>I am a lonely madman who banished his youngest child, whom he loved more than anyone else, over a trivial matter.</p>
<p>(Well then, once again—Scene, Action.)</p>
<p>Well now, dress me in a dress of words, my sweet children.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Rindou Affiliated Elementary School, Hallway (Day)<br />
Kou told Tsugumi words that ridiculed her coming from a wealthy family and braced himself against his own rule of thumb.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>(Ah, this is going to make her cry.)</p>
<p>The words just came out. Also, my rule of thumb. Generally, girls that are treated curtly would cry, and behind a guilty conscience, memories of her painful experiences would mock her.</p>
<p>But why? This girl doesn&#8217;t cry or scream, but instead replies aloofly. Moreover, her engine started up much faster than mine. Last time, I was the one who sold her the fight. Now, I was the one being sold a fight. When I thought about it, an irritation similar to elation rushed through my veins to my heart.</p>
<p>(Interesting!)</p>
<p>In response to my words, Sorahoshi Tsugumi stood up. We were being seperated like Romeo and Juliet, but we were in conflict with each other like Hamlet and Laertes.</p>

<p>“Then, I have no more family like you.”</p>

<p>Eyes. Chilly, frozen eyes.</p>
<p>They were not the eyes of a loved child. It was a whirlwind of madness spun, even stronger than her cruelty. This is the same girl who was smiling so happily just now?</p>
<p>I almost didn&#8217;t feel the oddness as I did before, but only at this one moment. I don&#8217;t believe in any illusions where a girl, who immediately became friends with Rin, can certainly look people in the eye, and more than anything else, skillfully perform the “evil” role.</p>

<p>“Then tell me, my lord, that the reason I have lost your heart is because I do not have the power of glib, and the way I operate in silence is displeasing to you.”</p>

<p>I raised my voice and declared like I was scolding myself harshly as I trembled.</p>

<p>“Do not implore me—it’s sickening. The arrow has already been fired. My body and heart that you loved are all a curse to me. Carry that curse with you as baggage wherever you go.”</p>

<p>Even so, it was meaningless in the face of the storm of madness. The corners of her mouth were raised in a thin, drawn-out sneer that could not be misinterpreted. It was mocking one’s own child who was banished for displeasing her.</p>

<p>“I wish you had never been born.”</p>

<p>A word that’s truer than any other. Darkness. Ahh, that’s right, she’s embracing the darkness. If that was the case, I won’t lose. Who do you think I am?</p>
<p>In contrast to the symbol of darkness, Kirio Tsugumi, I am the second coming of Kiritani Ouka, symbol of light, and eventually, the man who will surpass them.</p>

<p>“So for now, let us part with tears in our eyes. However, remember this. Hidden schemes will one day be exposed to the light, and anyone who extols evil will end up suffering pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence. Okay, so you’re backing down here. Ahh, but you can’t. There&#8217;s still something I need to tell you. I can’t put it well into words, but that’s right, it’s something import—ah.</p>

<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a gaze in between my interrupted concentration. Looking around, I saw Tsugumi&#8217;s parents, Rin and co, and the president, watching us with their arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Aren&#8217;t you going to continue? Brother?”</p>
<p>“Rin-chan, perhaps this is where the scene ends.”</p>
<p>“Ohh, I see. That&#8217;s Tsugumi&#8217;s mother for you.”</p>
<p>When I moved my neck like a tin man that had forgotten to oil themselves, the usual bunch were there. As if her switch was flipped off, she was completely out of her role, and was just the usual Sorahoshi Tsugumi.</p>
<p>…How does this fella switch so easily?</p>
<p>“Are you done, Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“Yup! Thanks for playing with me, Kou-kun.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah.”</p>
<p>Why do I have to be so depressed? I don&#8217;t even know who to swear at, so I just pretend to wipe my sweat off and look up at the ceiling again. However, her chilly, despising figure did not disappear from within my chest.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 2</strong></p>

<p>Breathing.<br />
??? (?)</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>—Haa, haa, haa…</p>

<p>I walked in the darkness. The flashlight that I held in my hand trembled, and I was unsteady from the creaking footsteps.</p>

<p>—Haa, haa, haa…</p>

<p>My vision was blurred and I could see traces of blood. I was at the limit of my exploration.</p>

<p>—Haa, haa, haa… Kuh.</p>

<p>My eyelids suddenly closed, perhaps from pain. I wiped my eyes and looked ahead, trying to shake off the fear—</p>

<p>“Hey, where are you going?”</p>

<p>—A voice called out to me from behind. I turned around and a hand touched my back.</p>

<p>“Aha, ha, hahahahahhihihihihihi.”</p>

<p>Blackout.<br />
Screams.<br />
The sound of rain.</p>

<p>Noise.</p>

<p>“Awa, awawawa, awawawawa.”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, you’re bad at this.”</p>
<p>“No, she’s good for her first time.”</p>
<p>I put down the controller at the sound of my young friends&#8217; voices.</p>
<p>“It’s scary. Scary, but interesting. It’s really hard, Juria-chan.”</p>
<p>The school tour was over. There was still time until lunch, so we are now playing games at Rin-chan’s house.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Yoruhata Residence, Living Room (Day)<br />
Tsugumi holds the controller together with Rin, Juria, and Mimi in a row in front of the TV. Thinking about how things got this way.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>In the end, we left Kou, who was still at school, and visited Rin-chan&#8217;s house. My parents had to go to work (They forcibly opened up their morning schedule. Sorry about that), so only Rin-chan&#8217;s father, Yoruhata Kazuma-san, was there to welcome us with a warm smile on his face.</p>
<p>Juria-chan, dressed in a boyish-look like I was today, and Mimi-chan, dressed in a girlish outfit with a soft skirt that catches people’s attention. Then, there was Rin-chan, who looked cute and fashionable in a navy blue dress, but changed into a jersey as soon as she arrived home.<br />
It was daytime on a weekday. The flowers were starting to be in full bloom. In front of Kazuma-san, who was smiling as he watched over us, Juria-chan revealed her horror game with a “tadah” and showed it to us.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, which one do you want to play first?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, t-they’re all scary in the end…”</p>
<p>“You have Biopandemic 9! Let’s play that one, Juria.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Is that okay with you, Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, like I thought, it&#8217;s famous for its scariness.”</p>
<p>It’s noisy when three women get together. I know that it is no different even with three children of the same gender. I gently grasped Mimi&#8217;s trembling hand and smiled to reassure her. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18463' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18463' title='Flowingcloud: The first sentence is a pretty common saying in Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;
Arocks141: I maintain that I had either no say or no hand in this.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>“Tsugumi-chan… will you persuade them with me to—”</p>
<p>”It&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s not scary if we play together.”</p>
<p>“—Of course, I knew it’d be like this.”</p>
<p>Mimi-chan hugged a cushion of an unfamiliar character in Rin&#8217;s house closely with an expression that indicated she’s given up. Her expression gave me the impression that she must be used to it.</p>
<p>“Where do you put whatever it is in this thing?”</p>
<p>“That’s where we’re starting?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Juria, Tsugumi is like a granny.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>This time, Mimi-chan comforted me as I curled up into the ‘く’ character. You&#8217;re a sweet girl, Mimi-chan…</p>

<p>Then, we go back to the beginning.</p>
<p>Initially, I was surprised by the video quality.</p>
<p>Afterward, the complex controls confused me.</p>
<p>And then, I was grinning at the effects that were more terrifying than I had imagined.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that it was a thrilling time for me, but to my regret, I was really bad at playing games. According to Juria-chan, I don’t have any sense. Gaming sense that is.</p>
<p>Rin-chan brought snacks and juice as we decided to take a break. I had always thought that sweets for children of this age were cheap candies, but there were elegant chocolates and potato chips in the lineup. <span id='easy-footnote-2-18463' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18463' title='Flowingcloud: Dagashi refers to cheap candies and snack foods. The Japanese equivalent of American penny candy in a nutshell. You used to be able to get them at Dagashiyas, but you can get them at Japanese convenience stores now. You might have heard of the manga/anime Dagashi Kashi. It’s pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagashi&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagashi&lt;/a&gt; '><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“Did you get them at the department store?”</p>
<p>&#8220;E-Err, you mean at the mall? Nope. They’re sold in convenience stores, you know?”</p>
<p>“It’s easy to forget, but Tsugumi is a rich young miss after all.”</p>
<p>“Nah, Rin, you can&#8217;t just forget being escorted in a car like that normally.”</p>
<p>They’re sold in convenience stores.. Well, I&#8217;ve never been to a convenience store since I was reborn, even when I was with my parents.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I didn&#8217;t really go much in my previous life either. After all, it was cheaper by being on good terms with the greengrocer or butcher and having them sell me the scraps. My last resort was to drink brewed chamomile tea, but in the end, I could survive with just water. I used the photocopier at the library, and copied recordings at Tae-chan, my fellow actresses&#8217; place. Phew, I do miss those times.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi doesn’t look like the type that went to preschool.”</p>
<p>“Yup, Juria-chan’s right.”</p>
<p>Digging through my memory, I find that Mikado-san (Koharu-san&#8217;s mother) took care of that part. Long story short, Mikado-san was my wet nurse. It was safer than going to nursery school. Well, the tutor that I had gotten in advance concluded in as you know.</p>
<p>“Did the three of you meet at nursery school?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Way before that.”</p>
<p>“M-My mom and Juria’s mother are friends.”</p>
<p>“My mom is friends with Mimi&#8217;s mom too.”</p>
<p>Then, Mimi-chan&#8217;s mother became a bridge between all of them. Mimi-chan&#8217;s mother must be a kind person just like Mimi-chan.</p>
<p>“M-My mom’s often said to be sexy, but she’s cozy and nice at home.” <span id='easy-footnote-3-18463' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18463' title='Flowingcloud: Author uses the onomatopoeic term ぽやぽや which relates to how cozy she is at home, but this also expresses how “fat and plump” someone is. Not sure if this was intended or not.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>“So that’s why Mimi-chan’s also kind.”</p>
<p>When I said this, she shook her hands and head in a fluster without a second’s delay in between.</p>
<p>“But, didn’t you console me earlier?”</p>
<p>“T-That was, umm…”</p>
<p>Rin-chan patted Mimi-chan, whose face turned bright red, on the back. Juria-chan smiled at Mimi-chan’s blushing. After smiling for a while, Juria-chan looked a little sad and looked down.</p>
<p>“My mom has been busy since way back. Mimi&#8217;s aunty used to take care of us since she was always out.”</p>
<p>She&#8217;s an actress after all. She sure is busy. However, whenever one asks about a busy actress, it’s in my actress nature to want to know their representative works. I think her name was Asashiro Sasatsuki-san. I’ll bring this homework to the library later.</p>
<p>Hm, wait, I can look it up on my cell phone, huh? This isn’t good, looking it up on my cell phone didn’t come up as my first choice…</p>
<p>“Does everyone know their parent’s debut work?”</p>
<p>When I timidly asked everyone, Rin-chan raised her hand first.</p>
<p>“Yup!”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>“My mom doesn’t have a debut work!”</p>
<p>I held back my wry smile as I was almost thrown off by her excessive energy. Come to think of it, Maho-san is an announcer, isn&#8217;t she? When I asked Rin-chan if it was so, she nodded while responding, “That’s right.”</p>
<p>“My dad’s debut work should have been “Detective Hinata Yuma&#8217;s Case File”.”</p>
<p>“W-Wasn’t Kazuma-san so cool!? An adult’s charm! Forbidden love!”</p>
<p>Rin-chan answered energetically, but Mimi-chan followed suit with even more passion. Forbidden love (koi), forbidden love (koi), huh? That’s deep (koi). <span id='easy-footnote-4-18463' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18463' title='Flowingcloud: The character for love used here is ‘恋’, which is read as ‘koi’. I don’t think I need to explain this silly pun any further.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>“M-My mom&#8217;s debut work is called “Tsubaki ~Love Rendezvous~”.”</p>
<p>“I know. My dad told me. He told me, “Rin, soap dramas are too early for you.””</p>
<p>Ah, Love Rendezvous? It seems like the essence of daytime dramas hasn’t changed since my previous life. Mimi-chan, who was speaking with sparkling eyes, must really love her mother&#8217;s acting. I could even feel her passion.</p>
<p>“What about Juria-chan?”</p>
<p>“Me? My parents… uhh, No. I can’t… tell you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>
<p>Juria-chan had been happily participating in the conversation earlier, but then, as if to cover up her distress, she lowered her eyebrows and laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>“Mom is… an amazing actress… but to be honest, she doesn’t want anyone to think that even though she’s amazing.”</p>
<p>Juria-chan’s words sounded somewhat sad. I didn&#8217;t know what to say to her when she was like that, but for the time being, I tried asking a harmless question.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Was her debut work a role she didn’t like?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I really like it though.”</p>
<p>Juria-chan hugged her knees and the words that came spilling out. Her eyes were dispirited and sinking down, as if avoiding the fluorescent lights. Even now, she seems like she’d break anytime.</p>
<p>“&#8230;If it’s something Juria-chan likes, then I also want to come to like it as well.”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“After all, we are friends, aren’t we? I want to know what my friends like. Right?”</p>
<p>She had small, squishy hands. They were just like mine—a child&#8217;s hands. I don&#8217;t really like the idea of her hands being hung down like this so weakly. I wondered if I was just trying to act cool. In that manner, I smiled at Juria-chan to the best of my ability, and eventually, I picked up on Rin-chan&#8217;s and Mimi-chan&#8217;s voices.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, you’re an amazing person, just like what I thought.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah, she’s right. You’re really, really cool.”</p>
<p>The two’s voices were off putting, but right now, Juria-chan comes first. Juria-chan showed numerous signs of hesitation, and eventually, she nodded.</p>
<p>When Juria-chan raised her head, the pain on her face from earlier was gone. She wiped the area around her eyes with her thumb, and I could see her usual appearance.</p>
<p>“My mom says there are no decent adults who are nice to women like that, but Tsugumi’s in the safe zone!”</p>
<p>Satsuki-san… What are you teaching your daughter?</p>
<p>“Ah, but don&#8217;t tell others about the title! It&#8217;s a friend&#8217;s oath!”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll also keep it a secret.”</p>
<p>“M-Me too!”</p>
<p>Rin-chan and Mimi-chan took action immediately and shouted after my reply.</p>
<p>“So, the title is…”</p>
<p>Just as she was about to tell us, I heard a melody I had heard somewhere before. This is, if I remember correctly, the main theme song of &#8220;The Depths of Evil”, a production in which I performed in in my previous life. She really does like horror, huh?</p>
<p>“Sorry, give me a moment—Hello, mom?”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Rin&#8217;s house.”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>“Eh! Really!?”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’ll go right now!!”</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>I could imagine what kind of exchange they had. Even so, Juria-chan’s whole face began to smile, and she seemed like she wanted to share her joy, so I asked her, “What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>
<p>“My mom said that her meeting finished early, so we can have dinner together today!”</p>
<p>“Really!? That&#8217;s great, Juria-chan!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. she’s coming to pick me up, so I’ll be going!”</p>
<p>Juria-chan then hurriedly put on her clothes and ran, yelling, &#8220;I’ll lend you all the game!” and ran off. It seemed that Satsuki-san had pulled up in front of the house, and from the sound of voices coming from the front door, it seemed that she was thanking Rin-chan&#8217;s father when she arrived.</p>
<p>Juria-chan ran out of the living room with a fierce dash, then fell forward heavily as she made a U-turn back. The moment she ran back towards us, she immediately bent down and secretly lowered her voice so that only we could hear her.</p>
<p>“The Dragon’s Tomb.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a secret! Got it!?”</p>
<p>This time, Juria-chan flew out the door.</p>
<p>“She’s so energetic.”</p>
<p>“R-Rin-chan’s not that different.”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>Two voices.</p>
<p>However, it felt like a hallucination, something that I could only hear from a far distance away somewhere.</p>
<p>After all, the title of that work was—</p>
<p>“The Dragon’s Tomb?”</p>
<p>It was a work that I—Kirio Tsugumi—had performed in in my past life.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 3</strong></p>

<p>Yoruhata Residence (Day)<br />
Tsugumi sees off Juria and reminisces on the title, “The Dragon’s Tomb”, that was mentioned when Juria left.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>1985. At the time, I was a fifteen-year-old girl with nothing to show for, and I kept myself fed by playing minor roles. In those days, I thought everything I did should be related to studying, so I spent my free time reading books, watching films, and wandering the streets. However, during one of those walks, I found a leaflet falling to pieces pasted onto a telephone pole. I decided to apply for the small scale audition that was being held by a small production company.</p>
<p>At the time, the leading actors had been decided, but the other roles were undecided—an audition lacking splendor. They first gathered everyone that passed the screening and they decided on their role based on what the actor was good at.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, at that point, there were only a few roles available: an evil spirit, a villain, a victim, and the protagonist&#8217;s best friend. The direction of the story is also a polarizing one, so the characters were not decent people. Even so, the film is filled with people who were living in obscurity right now and who really wanted to make it big. That was why the most unpopular role was the evil spirit, who would have their face hidden with makeup and could not become popular as an actor.</p>
<p>(Hmm…)</p>
<p>That was the film: The Dragon’s Tomb.</p>
<p>It was my debut work as an evil spirit actress.</p>
<p>(Asashiro Satsuki, Asashiro Satsuki… It’s no good, I can’t remember her.)</p>
<p>Even so, the main characters were quite the lineup, and they were hired by the production company with their little-to-none money. The leading role is played by Kusunoki Oza-san—25 years old at the time—a famous V-cinema actor who had a straight-laced, old-fashioned style of acting. Although Oza-san dies at the beginning, she appears in recollections of memories and becomes a key person in the story. The other was Koda Riku-san, who murdered Kusunoki-san for an unknown reason and ends up living while on the run. The film is structured into two time-axes: the present and the past.</p>
<p>I played the role of an evil spirit, the daughter of the previous clan leader, Itsuko. She was a tragic girl who married at 16 and was murdered at 18. The role of Minori was played by Urui Matsuko-san, a V-cinema actress. Minori was a yakuza’s wife who killed Itsuko in a conspiracy with Kaburaso Saburo played by Kusunoki-san. Kasaba Sara-san played Rumiko, who bullied Ai, the friend and now penpal of Saburo’s and Minori’s daughter. The role of Ai was played by Mikawa Miho-chan.</p>
<p>The two most likely candidates in terms of age were Sara-chan and Miho-chan. Sara, who was eight years old at the time, played the role of a twelve-year-old, however, she was a very good actress. On the other hand, Miho, who was 12 years old at the time, was petite and played the role of an 8-year-old girl. I had a strong impression that they were still gems in the rough.</p>
<p>Now… Sara would be 43 and Miho would be 47. They were girls younger than me, but now, they were already older than I was in my previous life.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>(That means she definitely changed her stage name.)</p>
<p>“Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>(Is she Miho-chan or Sara-chan?)</p>
<p>“Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>(She didn&#8217;t like her role. Then, is it Miho-chan? But you see…)</p>
<p>“Tsugumi… There’s no other choice. Take that!”</p>
<p>(She was—) “Hyahhh!?!?”</p>
<p>I flew up on reflex when I felt a caressing sensation on my sides. When I turned around and came back to my senses, I found that Rin-chan made use of her fingers and Mimi-chan was smiling wryly.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi is off guard.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you meant what you said, Rin-chan.” <span id='easy-footnote-1-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18466' title='Flowingcloud: Lost in translation moment and I’m not going to figure a way to make this work. Rin-chan uses the term “わきがあまい” (waki ga amai), which has several meanings. It could mean she was not paying attention and caught off guards, but could also literally mean that her sides are weak.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>I-I thought my heart was going to burst. I managed to catch my breath while softly grabbing Rin-chan&#8217;s fingers, who seemed to be proud of herself.</p>
<p>“You weren’t responding, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Ah. That’s, umm, sorry.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Tsugumi is my friend after all.”</p>
<p>“Uh, thank you?”</p>
<p>Huh? I felt like I got deceived somehow?</p>
<p>“What do you want to do, Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“What do I want to do?”</p>
<p>“My mom often tells me to ask myself, “Why?”, when I’m feeling icky inside.”</p>
<p>Why? Why, huh? It’s surely because I (Tsugumi [present]) want to clear away my friend’s unhappiness. The first friends I made in this life. After all, it’s too painful for a girl who loves her mother so much, but not to be able to say that she loves her mother&#8217;s works. However, I know it can also be seen as meddling.</p>
<p>And, I (Tsugumi [past]) am surely thinking about what will happen to my colleagues who acted in “The Dragon&#8217;s Tomb”. During the filming of that film, everyone was desperate. We started out by taking it easy, but in the end, we all gave it our all, and after the final shoot, we hugged each other and cried. I would like the reason why she doesn’t like that film.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
<p>“Why does Juria-chan’s mom not like The Dragon’s Tomb?”</p>
<p>My hesitant feelings spilled out naturally.</p>
<p>“Then, let&#8217;s watch The Dragon’s Tomb.”</p>
<p>Rin-chan proudly puffed out her chest, and Mimi-chan stared at her with respect. This girl is truly unpredictable. I don’t know if I should look forward to the future, or should be scared of it.</p>
<p>“Eh!? T-that’s a scary film, right?”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry. I heard that the movies back then weren’t as scary as the movies today.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>“I-Is that so?”</p>
<p>“The acting skills are old too.”<br />
…………</p>
<p>“Movies with no CG aren’t scary at all, you know?”</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>“………………Huh?”</p>
<p>Hmm, is that so?</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s with this chilly feeling?”</p>
<p>“S-Stop it, Rin-chan…”</p>
<p>Aside from Juria-chan, who’s a rare fan of horror films, most five-year-olds probably don&#8217;t watch horror films. Then, having them watch a horror film would probably be easier to understand than using a hundred words. Of course, I won&#8217;t tell them to watch “Saya” since they’re my friends.</p>
<p>However, if it was something like “The Depths of Evil”, the aftereffects wouldn&#8217;t be so bad. After all, it&#8217;s not good to decide on the value of a film based on its rumors.</p>
<p>“I’ll go ask my dad if he has the DVD!”<br />
Rin-chan said before leaving the living room, running for another room, and returning with Kazuma-san in tow. Kazuma-san stooped down to match Rin-chan and smiled as he staggered along. The thin case in his hand must be the DVD.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a VHS… Well, I guess that’s fine.</p>
<p>“Man, I’m put on the spot. Look here, guys. You can&#8217;t all see this movie.”</p>
<p>Kazuma-san smiled bitterly and showed us the packaging. But, what does he mean that we couldn’t watch it? Did he forget to break the tab and overwrite it? No, it&#8217;s a DVD, so that’s not it. I wracked my brain while Mimi-chan looked a little relieved. <span id='easy-footnote-2-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18466' title='Flowingcloud: Boomers would understand, but not the zoomers.

<p>“Ehh! Dad! Why!?”</p>
<p>And, Rin-chan was the quickest out of us to ask him.</p>
<p>“Uhh… R… 15?”</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>“That’s right. You can’t watch if you’re under 15.”</p>
<p>I feel bad for Rin-chan, whose cheeks were bulging, but it can&#8217;t be helped now that they mentioned it. If I were the adult in this position, I wouldn&#8217;t let five, six-year-olds watch a R15+ film. <span id='easy-footnote-3-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18466' title='Flowingcloud: Japan follows a similar rating system to Britain. Japan’s film rating system is as follows: G, PG12, R15+, R18+. What each rating stands for… Well, it’s pretty self-explanatory. '><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>…Juria-chan seemed to have watched it, but I wonder how she did it?</p>
<p>“Then, I&#8217;m going to be a 15 year old starting now!”</p>
<p>“Rin-chan, h-how are you going to do that?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsugumi! Give me a sample of a 15 year old!”</p>
<p>“I see, a sample… wait, eh…”</p>
<p>Kazuma-san wrly smiled as he watched Rin-chan spout unreasonable things. Mimi-chan looked as if she wanted to tell her, “Let’s give up already.” Rin-chan didn’t want to give up. As for me, from a moral standpoint, I wouldn’t want to let them break the R15 rule in front of an adult just to prioritize my own greed. Now that I think about it, there were some scenes in “The Dragon’s Tomb” that were pretty borderline okay.</p>
<p>If this is the reason for them to stray from the right path and become a delinquent, then I wouldn’t be able to look them in the eye ever again. A long skirt that drags against the ground and a sailor uniform that reveals their belly button. A school bag that had been dumped in boiling water, flattened, crushed, and has iron plates inserted into it to fight with. Samadhi… I-I can’t, I definitely can’t let them fall into that hole.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, as I thought, let’s give—”</p>
<p>“No, not yet.”</p>
<p>“—Rin-chan?”</p>
<p>Rin-chan interrupted Mimi&#8217;s attempt to stop her and raised her voice. I wonder what I’m feeling, I have a bad feeling about this—a feeling that it&#8217;s not going to end like this…</p>
<p>“There’s exactly three actors here. If one of us gets recognized as a 15-year-old by my dad, then we’ll be good!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Rin-chan&#8217;s unexpected words made me harden up like a stone statue unintentionally. As my eyes reflexively drifted towards Kazuma-san who lost his timing to interject and is now looking up into the void.</p>
<p>“Mimi, what kind of 15-year-old would be good if we were to become one?”</p>
<p>“U-Umm, let’s see, if Kazuma-san was the teacher, and we were the students for example, and umm…”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. I see, as expect of Mimi.”</p>
<p>Rin-chan looked at Mimi-chan with eyes filled with expectations. Mimi-chan faltered due to Rin’s pure gaze, however, she was getting fired up little by little.</p>
<p>…However, Kazuma-san did not miss that. Kazuma-san, as one would expect, raised his voice to keep us in check.</p>
<p>“If you’re lost, it’s best to go ho—”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sure that sensei is a soft-hearted person who has someone he doesn&#8217;t want but has no choice but to be engaged with. Even though sensei is all we have, sensei only talked about the person he didn’t even like. Then, we invaded sensei&#8217;s house and a forbidden love—awawawa.”</p>
<p>“—And, and?”</p>
<p>Kazuma-san&#8217;s suggestion was quickly brushed aside. Kazuma-san&#8217;s mouth flapped open wide then closed. Mimi-chan didn’t seem like she could be stopped and Rin-chan nodded her head in satisfaction.</p>
<p>…But, yup. It’s not possible to quit here after they prepared all this so far. After all, you see, I was an actress by nature. I swore to the Heavens and Earth that I would not allow myself to run away from the stage I desired without giving all my strength.</p>
<p>“No, wait, even if that were the case, how could I go about doing a romantic performance when we’re parent and child? Let’s just sto—”</p>
<p>“You’re not wrong. Then, I’ll be the cameraman and director.”</p>
<p>“U-Umm, I&#8217;ll be… Tsugumi-chan and Kazuma-san’s forbidden love… awawa, I’ll do my best!”</p>
<p>Rin-chan swiftly put the situation in order without letting Kazuma-san utter another word. She quickly started to prepare to film on her cell phone, and Mimi-chan took a deep breath. Looking at that scene, I apologized to Kazuma-san in my heart, but the inside of my mind was filled with acting.</p>
<p>“Haa, I got it, I got it. You’ve beat me. It can’t be helped, I’ll go along with this act.”</p>
<p>“T-Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Dad.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, haha, well, yeah. Well, it’s fine, but…”</p>
<p>Kazuma-san finally gave in and agreed. Well anyway, in the end, two young girls acting as 15 year olds is too much fluffiness… I better give my best support so they don’t fall astray into the wrong path in the future.</p>
<p>“Then, we&#8217;ll stay in the living room and Dad will be the teacher.”</p>
<p>“Sure, sure. I’ll be in your care, my cute Director. Ahh, that’s right, let me turn off my smartphone.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Kazuma-san took out his smartphone and operated it. I guess that means he’ll face me properly. He’s a kind person.</p>
<p>The edge of the living room. That was the line we decided on: outside the line was “offstage” and inside the line was the “stage”. First, the two of us enter. After sensei invited us to sit, the match would begin. I exchanged looks with Rin-chan, then when we nodded, Rin-chan pressed the button on her smartphone that was held up by a tripod.</p>
<p>There was… nothing special I needed to prepare, so I held the pouch I brought with me. I thought this would be used as a prop after all.</p>
<p>“All right, then, the title will be “Forbidden Love”. Well then, lights, camera, action!”</p>
<p>Okay, let&#8217;s tone down my switch. The girls that like sensei intruded into his house. Let’s go with that feeling.</p>

<p>“You’ve come. Well, have a seat.”</p>

<p>Since we had just barged into his house, I expected to be treated roughly. Contrary to my expectations, Kazuma-san gently welcomed us into his home.</p>
<p>Kazuma-san sat on a large sofa. Mimi-chan and I sat side by side on the other side of the low glass table. The distance between us even felt a little close. I could feel Mimi-chan&#8217;s nervousness as she gulped next to me.</p>

<p>“Let me get you some drinks right now. Is juice okay? If I remember correctly, Mimi-chan likes orange juice, right?”</p>
<p>“Eh, ah, y-yes.”</p>

<p>Mimi-chan answered quickly. I was amazed at the exquisite way he treated us like children while he couldn’t escape this mayhem. I think I need to follow up on this one.</p>

<p>“Sensei.”</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s wrong, Tsugumi-chan?”</p>
<p>“Please stop treating us like children.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, sorry, sorry. You are a girl even though you’re tiny.”</p>

<p>My words “treating us like children” made Mim-chani&#8217;s eyes open wide as she realized that she had been deceived just a moment ago. Kazuma-san still maintained a smile on his face. No matter how I argue with him, he never showed any gap in his gentle and enveloping attitude. As expected of the person who raised Kou-kun. As one would expect from a regular on Getsuku where shows are always guaranteed to get high viewership ratings. His stronghold can&#8217;t be broken by ordinary acting! <span id='easy-footnote-4-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18466' title='Flowingcloud: For those who forgot, Getsuku is the time slot for dramas that air at 9pm on Monday. This is traditionally the most popular time for TV dramas. This term appears often, so it’s convenient if you remember this term.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>

<p>“S-Sensei, are you going to marry, Sensei?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, that’s right, Mimi-chan. I have a person who I promised to marry.”</p>
<p>“Umm, err, b-but will you play with us after you marry?”</p>

<p>Mimi-chan leaned forward and told him.The way she said he couldn’t play with us was good. Her voice is subdued, she bit her lips, and her words are trembling. If I’m not mistaken, her mother was an actor who could play the bewitching role in soap dramas. Of course, Mimi-chan’s efforts must not be ignored. However, at the same time, it was a skill—that’s right, a skill that flowed in their blood. Such thoughts were going through my mind.</p>

<p>“No, you can come over and play.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’ll surely welcome you two.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>However, as he leaned over and scooped Mimi-chan up from her side and had her sit back down again, Kazuma-san gently stroked her head. None of his actions would be possible with a 15-year-old girl. Also, once you accept them, you’ve lost the psychological battle. Somehow, I have to do something.</p>
<p>But, what should I do? How can I reverse this situation where we’re being treated like children through and through.</p>

<p>“Well then, it’s okay for you to come over and play, but it’s about time to go home, isn’t it? Look.”</p>

<p>“Look,” he said as he pointed at the way, then I quickly turned my gaze in that direction.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s the five o&#8217;clock time signal.”</p>

<p>The five o&#8217;clock time signal. Before I can question him, I hear the Yuyake Koyake melody. <span id='easy-footnote-5-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-18466' title='Flowingcloud: This is the melody played at schools, city hall, etc. at 5pm sharp made for young children, reminding them it’s time to go home. They only play roughly a 30 sec melody instead of the full song though. This is another method on how Kazuma-san tries to treat them as kids.&lt;br /&gt;
Full Song: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FMta-NyvI&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_FMta-NyvI&lt;/a&gt; '><sup>5</sup></a></span>

<p>“Your mother will be worried. Right?”</p>

<p>At the end of the melody was Kazuma’s hand.</p>

<p>“Right?”</p>
<p>“Ah you’re right. I-It’s already five?”</p>

<p>Without thinking, Mimi-chan slightly rose to her feet.. However, as soon as she did so, Mimi-chan noticed that the clock’s hand was before five o&#8217;clock. However, she could not overturn the flow that she had got on. Mimi-chan realized that she had been played, and while she was dumbfounded, Kazuma-san wove his way through that gap and smiled at her.</p>

<p>“Well then, I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“O-Okay&#8230;”</p>

<p>When did he prepare that melody? That&#8217;s easy. Kazuma-san said he would turn off his cell phone, but played the melody. He must have set it to play the moment he pressed the play button when he turned his eyes towards the wall.</p>
<p>There’s nothing to be said. From beginning to end, we were simply dancing in the middle of Kazuma’s palm.</p>
<p>This is Yoruhata Kazuma, the noble youth of Getsuku!</p>
<p>As he prompted, I realized that we couldn’t drag our feet here any longer. Wasn&#8217;t this the right thing to do? After all, I didn&#8217;t have to show “The Dragon&#8217;s Tomb” to children. Wasn’t that all right? But, somewhere in my heart, a murky feeling—one that could not agree deep down—clung to my heart.</p>
<p>We got up from our seats and walked dejectedly offstage. Once we leave, no matter what we do, the stage is over. I wonder if it&#8217;s okay for it to end. But, what can I do at this point? I shook my head, unable to shake off my indecision and hesitation—then&#8230; I caught sight of it.</p>
<p>“Like I thought, it didn’t work… Dad is amazing after all…”</p>
<p>A soft voice. If it wasn’t for my ears, I surely would have failed to hear that voice. Rin-chan’s murmur. The loneliness hidden in her eyes and dispirited voice. The disappointment from the audience that weren’t able to watch the stage they desired. That reality thunderously flared up in the form of anger, anger of my childish acting—my own indulgent performance.</p>
<p>(What actress am I if I could not even fulfill one expectation, the one expectation everyone thinks I cannot meet?)</p>
<p>Think. Think. Think—Sorahoshi Tsugumi.</p>
<p>She wanted me to act. She wanted me to be something. How could I call myself an actress if I could not fulfill a single wish of a child?</p>
<p>What did Mimi-chan say initially? What kind of acting did she want? What did she want me to be?</p>
<p>(“I&#8217;m sure that sensei is a soft-hearted person who has someone he doesn&#8217;t want but has no choice but to be engaged with. Even though sensei is all we have, sensei only talked about the person he didn’t even like. Then, we invaded sensei&#8217;s house and a forbidden love—awawawa.”)</p>
<p>Love, love, huh? Forbidden love. The love one desires.</p>
<p>Affection that makes one go mad. A passion that makes one grieve in pain. An ecstasy that causes one to overcome illnesses.</p>
<p>Kazuma-san is a young noble that puts on a sweet mask. An adult combination of Kou-kun and Rin-chan. If he were a teacher, he would probably be very popular. I am a student and cannot get married yet, but in another year, I will be legally recognized as a woman. If it’s for sensei’s sake, I could surely do anything, and have anything done to me. That’s love after all. <span id='easy-footnote-6-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-18466' title='Flowingcloud: Legal age of marriage in Japan is 16 for women (but legal consent from parents is required for those under 18) and 18 for men. Tsugumi is “15” right now, so she only needs one more year until she becomes a “woman”.'><sup>6</sup></a></span>
<p>My teacher has a fiancee due to his parent’s orders. But, I have only him. I only have him in my eyes, and I can do anything and everything for him.</p>
<p>However, because he has a fiancee, he created a smokescreen by showing me pictures of them cuddled up together like lovers, even though their gazes were looking somewhere else.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, Sensei.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make you forget about that woman (fiancee).</p>

<p>“Mimi-chan. I have something I forgot, so go back home first.”</p>
<p>“S-Sure, but… something you forgot?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. Something really important.”</p>

<p>I won’t even let you think about running away.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Yoruhata Residence (Day)<br />
Kazuma tactfully deals with Mimi and Tsugumi, then is relieved with how things had smoothly proceeded.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>(Well then, I wonder what’s going on…)</p>
<p>Not having understood the course of events, I was out of luck when I returned to my study and picked up my novel that I had begun to read. I was negligent to assume that just the three of them wouldn’t make an uproar after Satsuki-san took Juria-chan back home. When I tried touching the surface of what was occurring, I was unable to enter their girl-characteristic conversation topics, and before I knew it, I was about to act as the partner in a “forbidden love” with a five-year-old girl.</p>
<p>Of course, I would be lying if I said I didn&#8217;t want to see my partner&#8217;s acting ability after talking so much about her. Both of my children are excellent, but putting aside Rin, who has yet to bloom, it was too funny to think that she could surpass Kou who has been said to be the second coming of Kiritani Ouka.</p>
<p>(It would be embarrassing to play the role of a prince in front of the children, but man.)</p>
<p>Seeing the look of anticipation on Rin&#8217;s face as her heart swelled with excitement, I don&#8217;t think I could have refused. More than anything else, I thought that Rin might learn something, so I couldn’t do anything half-heartedly as her father.</p>
<p>At any rate, even if you factor my bias as a parent, Rin&#8217;s talent is tremendous. If this becomes the opportunity that makes her bloom, it would be a great blessing for me as a parent and as an actor.</p>
<p>(The world is changing. If Rin had not said so, I would have made light of them as just a child’s opinion, but now, is she the real thing or just a sham? Either way, if we were going to do an improvised play, I thought I would at least face this kid so she wouldn&#8217;t lose face… Were my expectations too high?)</p>
<p>In the end, she went along with the plan I made on the spot. Tsugumi-chan did show a little bit of mature behavior, but that was all. It was likely that Rin was just exaggerating—was what I thought, however…</p>

<p>“Mimi-chan. I have something I forgot, so go back home first.”</p>

<p>I turned my head towards where I could hear those words coming from. Are we going to continue? It could be said that it was already over, but putting aside Mimi-chan that was already stepped out offstage, Tsugumi-chan was still onstage.</p>

<p>“S-Sure, but… something you forgot?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. Something really important.”</p>

<p>Having said that, Tsugumi-chan turned back and walked away.</p>
<p>Well then, what kind of teacher should I go with next? Well, I guess it’ll be fine if I go along with the feeling of what my partner wants to do. Yoruhatas are good at that kind of thing.</p>
<p>However, it would be tricky to keep it sweet the second time around. I&#8217;m sorry for Tsugumi-chan, but next time I&#8217;ll go with a colder approach. It’d be scary in various meanings if Maho finds out, but for the time being, let’s not think about it. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Well then, let’s see what you’ve got this time. Putting myself aside, don’t let Rin down. Got it, Tsugumi?</p>

<p>“—Am I bothering you?”</p>

<p>A worrying behavior. Forgetting something was just an excuse, huh? I see, that’s a bit of a childish worry. After I prompted her to sit on the sofa in front of me, I sighed loudly.</p>

<p>“Let’s see. I can’t say that it was okay to intrude into my home.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Sensei. But, I—”</p>
<p>“You came back to retrieve something you forgot. Therefore, go back home after you drink this. Okay?”</p>

<p>I placed an empty cup. It&#8217;s not uncommon for cups to be toppled over depending on the contents of the performance. If I left a stain on the living room carpet, I don’t know what to say to Maho.</p>
<p>Tsugumi-chan was looking downwards. She hid her eyes with her bangs and looked dispirited. I see. she turned back on impulse, but had been reprimanded and was depressed. If that’s the case, I can guess what will happen next. She confesses her feelings, gets rejected, then gives up or she cries. If it were an impromptu play by a child actor, the conclusion would be something like that.</p>

<p>“I want you to teach me something.”</p>
<p>“Did you not understand something during class? Okay, what did you not understand?”</p>

<p>I smiled gently. Let&#8217;s set up a situation so that it becomes easier for her to confess her feelings. Tsugumi-chan is still looking down. I could not see her eyes and her voice was flat. I wonder if she was nervous or excited, and this would be a good scene to put a little more emotion. Well, I can guide her with feedback later. For now, I should accompany her to the end.</p>

<p>“Sensei, do you really love your fiancee?” <span id='easy-footnote-7-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-18466' title='Flowingcloud: Lost in translation slightly. In the previous dialogue, Tsugumi asks for Kazuma to “teach me something.” The term she uses is ‘教えて’ which means to teach, but also to tell. Thus, while Kazuma interpreted it as “teaching”, Tsugumi jebaited Kazuma as she meant to tell her if Kazuma really liked his “fiancee”.'><sup>7</sup></a></span>

<p>A flat tone. Is there some intention behind it? But, I don&#8217;t get the feeling that the world is changing as Rin said. Are there conditions depending on the role?</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s fine. I guess she wants to take it in the direction where she loves me more than my fiancee. If that&#8217;s the case, then I&#8217;ll go along with her.</p>
<p>…Nonetheless, isn’t the term “fiancee” a bit too old? <span id='easy-footnote-8-18466' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-8-18466' title='Flowingcloud: Tsugumi uses the term “許嫁” (iinazuke) which is older term. People tend to use the term “婚約者” (konyakusha) nowadays. They both mean fiance/fiancee.'><sup>8</sup></a></span>

<p>“Ahh, of course. I love her.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. —Ah, could I have some water?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>

<p>Water? Ahh, you don&#8217;t want to hear it. You want to deceive and divert my attention, huh? Mhm, I see, that&#8217;s clever.</p>

<p>“Ahh.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>Her hand extended in a camly, but perhaps out of nervousness, she knocked over the cup. She stood up in a fluster, walked around the table, and tried to wipe the stain with a handkerchief she took out of her pouch. The cup had fallen over in my direction. I see… this is the sort of scene where she wipes my pants and our hands touch.</p>
<p>I get it, I understand. I was made to perform lots of embarrassing dialogues and acts by Maho. Girls love that kind of thing. No, this was for Rin&#8217;s sake. I can&#8217;t be embarrassed about it.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, Sensei. I&#8217;ll clean this up right away.”</p>
<p>“No, that&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll wipe it myself.”</p>

<p>I matched her timing and reached out my hand. But, was she still nervous? The handkerchief slipped from Tsugumi-chan&#8217;s hand and fell at my feet.</p>

<p>“I was careless.”</p>

<p>She reached her hand out.</p>

<p>“—Aha.”</p>

<p>I felt a tingle creep through my spine. Faster than I could raise my head, she embraced my head closely.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you.”</p>

<p>Small hands.</p>
<p>Thin body.</p>
<p>Flower aroma.</p>

<p>“Sensei’s the one at fault here, you know—after all, you compared a woman you don’t even love to me.”</p>
<p>“Let—”</p>
<p>“Yes, there we go.”</p>
<p>When our bodies separated and I got away, she pushed me against the back of the sofa. It was something even someone with a child’s strength could do. All I had to do was assist her in the direction of the force, in the direction where I tried to back off. Then, she rested her knee between my legs, twisted her body like a cat, and placed her thumb to pinkie on my chest with a hand lacking any hesitation.</p>
<p>Her expression, which had been hidden by her bangs. Her long, which had been hidden so I could not discern it. They were distorted by lust and longing, imitating a warped crescent moon.</p>
<p>What should I do? What should I do? What to do? No, first I need to back off. I can’t afford to put my hands on my student, a young girl not to mention.</p>

<p>“If Sensei pushes me away, I might hit my head and pass away, right?”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18467" src="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00072-210x300.jpeg" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00072-210x300.jpeg 210w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00072-717x1024.jpeg 717w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00072-768x1097.jpeg 768w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/00072.jpeg 1006w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 85vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>One step before I was about to put that thought into action, that thought was denied at a perfect timing, then I stopped thinking for a moment. I learned from a lecturer a long time ago that this is due to the psychological principle where people experience an in-denial-response when their ideas get rejected.</p>
<p>No. Don’t go with the flow. What will happen to my position as a teacher? What about my house? How would I explain this to her (fiancee)? That’s why, reject her!</p>

<p>“It’s fine to forget about your position, money, upbringing, and bonds.”</p>

<p>Again!</p>
<p>She’s interrupting me again! Her eyes distorted, like an unreasonable child. Those were devilish eyes.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>

<p>I murmured. My voice sounded shrill with excitement. I wonder whether that hot passion was in my chest, or in her hands.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you forget everything. That’s why—”</p>

<p>Her small hands traced her own pale pink lips.</p>

<p>“—Please go crazy for me. My precious, my only Sensei.”</p>

<p>That finger elegantly traced my lips.</p>

<p>“—Cut!”</p>

<p>The passion faded away.</p>
<p>The usual innocent glance, gentle, apologetic, and well-mannered beauty.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much! Um, sorry for showing such a vulgar act.”</p>
<p>“—Ah, ahh, no, it’s fine. It’s just a performance after all.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>What is this? What is going on? Of course, no matter how you look at it, I could not have any unusual feelings for a girl whose age is separated by many years. However, that was not the problem. That uncomfortable feeling was not that.</p>
<p>No, that’s it—at that moment, I was not the father guiding my daughter’s friend in acting, but I was definitely a teacher named “Yoruhata Kazuma”.</p>
<p>(Is the world changing? It’s not that simple.)</p>
<p>The more sensitive one is, the more amazing that image’s “regurgitation” becomes. She has excellent senses. Talent and skill to swallow up others through acting. At only five years old?</p>
<p>(Currently, I am definitely—swallowed up in her world.)</p>
<p>I looked at the girl enjoying a conversation with my daughter. She’s an ordinary girl, however, at that moment, she was a “woman” that possessed both childishness and a bewitching charm, blurring even the boundaries of age.</p>
<p>“Good grief, Rin’s discerning eye is truly terrifying.”</p>
<p>“The Tomb of the Dragon”. The film, although a horror production, was a more glamorous film than the scene that she just showed me in real time. Well, it would at least make you think whether it would or not.”</p>
<p>“Well, it can’t be helped. It is the reward.”</p>
<p>But, well, I’d feel bad for Rin and Mimi-chan, so I&#8217;ll watch it with them. That’s right, looking at the DVD in my hand—suddenly, I realized that my hand was shaking.</p>
<p>(Ha, haha. Man, I’ve been had no matter how I look at it.)</p>
<p>I sunk deeply into the sofa and stared at my trembling hands. I’m not sure if the corners of my mouth curved in fear or excitement. Either way, a sigh spilled out of my throat as if on par with its scariness.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 4</strong></p>

<p>Yoruhata Residence (Day)<br />
Tsugumi watches the film “The Dragon’s Tomb” side by side with Rin and Mimi. Tsugumi reminisces about those times while watching over her scared little friends.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The words “The Dragon’s Tomb” written in blood appeared on the screen. The film began with a scene where Tatsu, a yakuza, shoots and kills his brother who has just been released from prison, in front of a tomb. Tatsu is manipulated by an evil spirit to kill his friends, and as he runs away, a woman&#8217;s footprints consisting of blood continue to follow behind him… This is the scene many people have seen in the promo. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18480' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18480' title='Flowingcloud: We finally get more info about “The Dragon’s Tomb”! The title itself is a pun. Tatsu’s name is ‘辰’, which literally means the zodiac dragon. Thus, the “dragon’s tomb”. Get it?'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>“Eh, um, he’s already dead…”</p>
<p>I held back the urge of having a wry smile appear at the sound of Rin&#8217;s voice as she muttered, overcome with surprise. It’ll be intense from here on… Yeah, well, this is also considered studying.</p>
<p>Then, the scene after this is a recollection. Kabura Sousaburo, the elder brother of the person who died at the beginning of the film, kills Kabura&#8217;s (yes, his own) ex-wife, Itsuko—played by Kirio Tsugumi—in order to stay with his mistress, Minori. Therefore, Minori breaks down when Itsuko appears in her dreams every night, and evil falls upon Minori&#8217;s daughter, Rumiko. That was because the one Rumiko was bullying at school is actually Ai-chan, an elementary school student who used to be Itsuko&#8217;s penpal.</p>
<p>That’s right, this bullying scene and the scene where Rumiko is later killed by Itsuko are the scenes in which Rumiko, performed by Kasaba Sara, received a great deal of recognition.</p>
<p>“Awawa, A-Ai-chan met Rumiko, Tsugumi-chan…”</p>
<p>The screen showed Rumiko questioning Ai on the stairs.</p>

<p>“Look who it is, Gomiko-chan.” <span id='easy-footnote-2-18480' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18480' title='Flowingcloud: Decided to leave it as is. It’s common for Japanese female names to end in ‘ko’, so Rumiko calls Ai, gomi-ko. Gomi means trash. Basically, another mean way to call someone trash.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“&#8230;That’s not my name.”</p>
<p>“Are you talking back? You think you’re great now, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Rumiko approached Ai with a sneer as she looked down on her. At most, she comes off as a haughty girl. However, when Ai glared back at her without fear, Rumiko&#8217;s attitude visibly changed.</p>

<p>“Why is someone like you getting close to Muraoka-kun? Don’t tell me perhaps you mistaken yourself as someone special? Don’t make me laugh. Someone like you is just a trash can that no one wants to deal with. Don’t get cocky when you’re just a bitch. Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry!!”</p>

<p>Madness. The face of malice from her everyday life revealing itself. The intense performance she gave. Ai was frightened and frozen in fear by it, and Rumiko saw that with a warped smile.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Someone like you should have never been born.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>Ai fluttered about in the air from the staircase. Ai created a red pool at the bottom of the stairs. Seeing this, Rumiko pointed her finger and laughed, then turned on her heel and walked away, as if bored.</p>
<p>“Eh? Eh? Eh? S-She died?”</p>
<p>Mimi-chan muttered in a stifled voice. However, this is the place where Itsuko possesses her and helps Ai. Kindness shown by an evil spirit, sort of. This scene had divided opinions.</p>
<p>“Mimi, Mimi, it looks like she survived.”</p>
<p>“Oh… T-That’s good.”</p>
<p>Rumiko almost killed Ai, then comes the climax. The scene is the one I’ve mentioned—the scene at the beginning of the story where their group, led by Tatsu the junior brother, go to celebrate the release of Kabura Sousaburo from prison. Tatsu wipes his eyes with his thumb, happy that his brother has been released from prison. But in fact, Tatsu was having an affair with Minori, so he gave her a wink, one that only Minori would understand.</p>
<p>Then, when Minori sees Tatsu off, a trail of blood appears behind her. Here, Itsuko groans, which the viewer notices, but Minori does not notice.</p>

<p>“■■■u■”</p>
<p>“■a■a■■”</p>
<p>“i■uuu■”</p>

<p>A hoarse voice. The sounds of scraping. The sound of something being ground, kneaded, and crushed. Rin-chan and Mim-chani noticeably sprung up. Umm, I’m kind of sorry…</p>
<p>Then, here is the scene where the directors adopted some ideas while I argued with him about how this wasn’t good and how that wasn’t good. The evil spirit approaches Minori, disappearing and appearing, moving and changing its position in time matching the flickering light bulbs.</p>

<p>“■■■i”<br />
‘<br />
“I-Itsuko? H-How?!”</p>

<p>Minori spoke frightenedly after she noticed her.</p>
<p>—Rin-chan and Mimi-chan swallowed their saliva after hearing her.</p>

<p>“@#)($@$(**” <span id='easy-footnote-3-18480' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18480' title='Flowingcloud: It’s gibberish in the raws.&lt;br /&gt;
Arocks141: Yeah, utter gibberish.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>“Eek!”</p>

<p>An incomprehensible voice. A rain of blood poured down on Minori. Rin-chan and Mimi-chan were in tears.</p>
<p>The scene switched to where the camera shows bloody footprints while Rumiko held her knees in her room. Rumiko saw Ai being saved. She thought Ai was dead for sure, but she might have survived. When that thought came into mind, Minori might be scolded. This scene shows Rumiko’s strong feelings of avoiding being scolded rather than feelings of guilt.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>

<p>The wooden door creaked open.</p>

<p>“Mom? Tatsu? Is dad home?”</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>“Mom? What’s with you? You could at least give me a response.”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Mom? Are you perhaps angry?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Geez! What is—Eek!”</p>

<p>Watching her once again, Sara-chan really acted that well. The door opens, revealing a sea of blood, and Sara-chan shows derangement true to her nature. She looks around in horror, and then her eyes meet with Itsuko, the evil spirit, floating just beyond her gaze.</p>
<p>The scene where Itsuko’s cloudy eyes filled the screen. Next to me, I heard Rin-chan’s and Mimi-chan’s feeble shriek.</p>

<p>“Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!?”</p>

<p>The camera moved from Rumiko’s neck then panned down. Rumiko’s body slowly rose. A muffled voice. Blood flowed down like a waterfall from under her feet into the corridor.</p>

<p>“■■■■i, ■■■■a.”</p>

<p>A voice that ought not to be sound.</p>
<p>Dissonance coming from a human throat that could not produce sound.</p>
<p>Soon, Rumiko&#8217;s struggling legs drooped weakly, occasionally jerking and twitching.</p>
<p>Blackout.</p>
<p>Rin-chan and Mimi-chan, who were in front of the screen, became white as a sheet, and the scene returned to Tatsu, after the beginning of the film. Here, a flashback occurs. Tatsu was actually in a relationship with Itsuko, but he left her for Minori. However, he kept seeing Itsuko, who was married to his older brother.</p>
<p>The scene in which he clings to Itsuko&#8217;s grave and begs for her forgiveness is quite touching, but Rin-chan and Mimi-chan&#8217;s eyes were cold.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, forgive me, Itsuko.”</p>

<p>Thus, Itsuko appears in front of Tatsu, and the confused man shoots her with a pistol. Then, Minori, Rumiko, and other people whom Itsuko cursed and killed are lying there as if they were killed by Tatsu… This was the scene where I was evaluated highly as a horror actress. Phew, how nostalgic.</p>

<p>“Why, why, why, why, why!!”</p>

<p>When Itsuko finally appeared, Itsuko made a gun shape with her hand and stuck it into her mouth. Then, as if manipulating Tatsu, he also performed the same action and stuck his gun into his mouth.</p>

<p>“Ughh, ughhh!! F-Forgi—eek!”</p>
<p>Gunfire.</p>
<p>The blood downpoured over Itsuko&#8217;s tomb wiggled and wriggled, then turned into the character “辰” (Tatsu). Then, Itsuko&#8217;s distorted laughter echoed and darkness fell.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Awa, awawa, awawawa, awawawa, awawawa.”</p>
<p>On the screen, we were informed what happened later that day. It is the scene where Ai and her male classmate send a letter typed on a typewriter to their usual correspondent. She puts it in the mailbox and goes home.</p>
<p>The day after, Ai spends her daily life with a slight pain. Then, at midnight, the story closes out when a reply to her letter is mailed from empty space into her mailbox at her house.</p>
<p>“How was it?”</p>
<p>“W-W-Why hasn’t Tsugumi’s expression changed at all?????”</p>
<p>“I can’t…. I can’t…”</p>
<p>Rin-chan held my right hand tightly without letting go.</p>
<p>Mimi-chan clung to my left hand tightly without letting go.</p>
<p>Yup, this is what should happen when you watch a horror movie.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since I’ve watched it, but it’s unthinkable that this is Kirio Tsugumi’s first time playing an evil spirit.”</p>
<p>“T-Tsugumi? Dad, Tsugumi didn’t appear in the movie.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, no, you’ve got it mixed up. It’s a horror actress from back then. There aren’t any horror films Rin can watch at your age after all.”</p>
<p>“???”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. My blind spot was that they were designated as R15+. If that’s the case, it wouldn’t be surprising for them not to know. Ahh, but I could have made that scene scarier. I could have made the joints look like they were in the rigor mortis state. Also, the voice should have been more muffled. That was a scene I didn’t want to be put in the film even though that would have made the scene more realistic.</p>
<p>Sara-chan must have surely been more afraid—that’s right, Kasaba Sara-chan, the actor playing Rumiko. You could clearly see in the video. She’s older now and her makeup made it difficult to recognize her expression, but that was definitely Sara-chan. Asashiro Satsuki-san was Sara-chan.</p>
<p>“Uuh, i-is that voice synthesized?”</p>
<p>“Nope. It’s different—it seems.” <span id='easy-footnote-4-18480' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18480' title='Flowingcloud: Our girl was about to give herself away before the end of the first volume lol.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>“Oh, Tsugumi, you’re well informed. Every bit of it seemed to have been done technique-only.”</p>
<p>Oh yes. When I first saw vocal percussion on TV in an electronics store in 1983, I thought to myself, “That’s it. This is going to expand my acting range.” So, I watched how street performers moved their mouths, and practiced while wiping off real blood vomit by gnawing into my oral cavity. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t hurt my throat.</p>
<p>That helped me to naturally expand my vocal technique. The way I did my voice later on was quite terrifying if I had to say so myself, and I believed I finished perfecting it in “Heartbeat”, the last movie I appeared in while I was alive.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, Mimi.”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>“Wh, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Stay over for the night.”</p>
<p>Trembling fingers.</p>
<p>Bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>Blood coming from the lips.</p>
<p>“Umm, Rin’s father&#8230;” <span id='easy-footnote-5-18480' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-18480' title='Flowingcloud: If you’re confused, Rin’s the one that’s asking for them to stay over for the night.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>
<p>“Haha, I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>I took out my smartphone, opened it with facial recognition. I opened it, then, errr.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, flick it this way.”</p>
<p>Flick, tap, and ohhh, it appeared!</p>
<p>“Hello, Mommy?”</p>
<p>“Ara, what is it, Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“Is it fine if I stay over at Rin-chan’s house tonight?”</p>
<p>“Oh my. Hehe, sure, that’s fine. Could you hand the phone over to Mr. Yoruhata?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mommy! Umm, my mother would…”</p>
<p>As I spoke, I handed the smartphone to Kazuma-san and he willingly accepted it. Kazuma-san looked cool casually talking with his hand on his waist. Rin-chan and the others who could easily operate these devices were also cool.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, Haha, it’s alright.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Yes. Well then, I will contact you tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After having an adult conversation with my mother, Kazuma-san returned my smartphone to me. When I smiled at Rin-chan and Mimi-chan, who were still clinging to each other, those two smiled back like a flower blooming.</p>
<p>Occasionally, this sort of thing is… yeah, sort of fresh and nice.</p>
<p>Why did Sara-chan come to hate acting?</p>
<p>What on earth happened during the blank 20 years?</p>
<p>I had countless questions, but for now.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, are you here?”</p>
<p>“Awawawawa, awawawawa.”</p>
<p>Let’s give my adorable little best friends a helping hand.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene: Ending</strong></p>

<p>Bedroom, Yoruhata Residence (Night)<br />
Mimi wakes up, giving a side glance towards Rin and Tsugumi who were deep asleep.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>“Toilet.”</p>
<p>Mimi opened her eyes with a snap and muttered as if groaning. It was a physiological phenomenon, so there was nothing she could do. If she doesn’t get up, a disaster is going to occur.</p>
<p>“Mmm.”</p>
<p>However, the image of Rumiko&#8217;s body hanging from the ceiling by the evil spirit still stuck in her mind. If I were to escape from this safe peace where the three of them were sleeping in the shape of the ‘川’ character, a pale arm would instantly reach out and clamp down on her head.</p>
<p>That dreadful thought accompanied by the chilliness ran up her spine, and Mimi hugged her body tightly.</p>
<p>“Rin-chan, Rin-chan!”</p>
<p>Mimi instinctively called out to her best friend.</p>
<p>“Zzz, I am the messenger from the heavens…”</p>
<p>However, her best friend was not one to get up easily.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi-chan, Tsugumi-chan.”</p>
<p>As a last resort, she called her to her somewhat amazing new friend.</p>
<p>“Hollywood… Hollywood…”</p>
<p>However, she was also brazenly sleeping soundly, with the occasional grin and giggle.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Now, she was in a tight spot. She had to choose between fear and being a maiden. It flashed through her mind: If the three got together at her friend’s house again, would it be possible to forget this act of indignity??</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not scared, I’m not scared.”</p>
<p>The time she hesitated was short. She may be six years old, but she was still a little girl. She couldn&#8217;t make a choice that would stain her dignity at her best friend&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>She crept out of her futon and put on her glasses. She walked, frightened by the sound of her own footsteps. “If only Juria was here.” The number of times those words repeated in her mind surpassed the number of fingers on both hands.</p>
<p>“It’s not scary, it’s not scary, it’s not scary. It’s not scary, right? Scary… ugh.”</p>
<p>It was a friend&#8217;s house. She knew where the toilet was located. The floorboards didn’t creak. The lesser the noise, the lesser the fear. She entered the bathroom with this in mind, and the white light reassured her.</p>
<p>However, the real horror began here. Once she got out of the bathroom and turned off the light, her vision, which had been accustomed to the light, had been reset. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to sleep in the toilet than to go back in the pitch black? Mimi quickly shook away this thought. Dignity was one thing, but there was no way she could sleep alone.</p>
<p>“I’m not scared… I think. I’m not scared… probably. Scary things are—”</p>

<p>“&#8230;”</p>

<p>“—!?”</p>
<p>Voices. Voices. Mimi heard voices. “That was close,” Mimi thought, a calm part of Mimi told herself. If she had noticed it on her way to the toilet, her maiden’s dignity would have been shattered.</p>
<p>Half in relief, half in resentment, Mimi turned her head in the direction of the voice. Was it from the living room? Looking closer, she saw a faint light leaking from the edge of the door.</p>
<p>(An adult?)</p>
<p>Mimi realized that it was the voice of Rin&#8217;s parents. At this point, she wanted to hear the voice of a reliable adult, even if it was just the voice that escaped through the door.</p>
<p>Mimi walked unsteadily and somewhat timidly down the hallway, then stuck to the door like a fox warming itself in a snowy field.</p>

<p>“—?”</p>
<p>“Eh—lly?”</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>“Sh—”</p>

<p>As expected, those voices were directly coming from Rin’s parents. What sort of conversation were they having? Her child-like ability to concentrate increased, and she picked up more clearly on the conversation.</p>

<p>“Look here. When you lowered your head, Kazuma.”</p>
<p>“I see, her switch was already on at that point.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a child’s smile, but this is too shoddy to be an adult’s calcultive smile.”</p>
<p>“Truly what it means to be in between an adult and a child. So she was acting as a 15-year-old girl, huh?”</p>
<p>“So, what’s the impression from the adult who let a five-year-old girl perform such a role?”</p>
<p>“Well, I have completely no idea why the theme went from a “15-year-old girl” to “a 15-year-old’s forbidden love”. I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>“Pft… ahaha, I get it. Pft, hahaha.”</p>

<p>Mimi immediately realized that this was a review. At that time, Mimi watched, holding her breath alongside Rin. The usually cute Tsugumi approached Kazuma with an adult-like atmosphere and completely aced Mimi&#8217;s request of “forbidden love”.</p>
<p>Mimi asked herself at that moment if she could act like Tsugumi. Can she act like that? Mimi’s heart replied with words bouncing back at her.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s no way I could do that.)</p>
<p>Yuugao Natsu—Mimi&#8217;s mother is an active soap drama actress. Although she smiles nonchalantly and says things like, “That’s all I can do,” her mother’s dramas that she watched alongside her father, who’s always kept on suspense, all show a different and sexy side of her mother.</p>
<p>I want to act like this too. That’s right, Mimi studied acting at a very young age, crying over the difficulties of vocalization and acting, but she was a girl that continued to work hard.</p>

<p>“It seems like she doesn’t have any acting experience, you know?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. That girl is unmistakably—a genius.”</p>
<p>A genius. If one was born with the making of a genius, they could destroy the efforts of ordinary people with the snap of a finger. Why does Mimi not have that talent? Why does Tsugumi have that talent?</p>
<p>‘No,’ Mimi shook her head. Juria could also give an amazing performance. If one were close enough, they would know that Rin&#8217;s talent is also amazing. Only she herself was mediocre.</p>
<p>(That’d be nice.)</p>
<p>If Mimi had that talent.</p>
<p>(That’d be nice.)</p>
<p>If Mimi had that ability.</p>
<p>(That’d be nice.)</p>
<p>If Mimi could also perform like that.</p>
<p>(That’d be nice.)</p>
<p>Will that smolder dwelling in her young heart disappear?</p>
<p>The next thing she knew, Mimi was back in the bed where the three of them were sleeping. She took off her glasses and looked at Tsugumi, who was happily sleeping at point-black range. The more she looked at her, the more she realized that she had a beautiful face, and when she tried touching her cheek, it was soft and bouncy. Mimi also knew that her eyes, which were now shut tight, were dazzling blue like jewels.</p>
<p>In comparison, how about her? She had the ordinary chestnut-like brown-colored eyes that could be found anywhere. In addition, she couldn’t say she had good eyes, since watching a lot of TV had an effect on her eyes, and wore unfashionable glasses.</p>
<p>(That’s nice.)</p>
<p>Born a genius.</p>
<p>She could act without practicing.</p>
<p>She looks so beautiful that one could mistake her for a fairy.</p>
<p>She could perform bad roles flawlessly, so good that she didn’t say no when pushed onto her.</p>
<p>(That’s nice.)</p>
<p>In the end, even in her fifteen-year-old acting, Mimi was holding her back and couldn&#8217;t do anything. Tsugumi later followed up, telling her not to worry about it, but it was all the more miserable. It was as if her own worthlessness was being thrusted before her, making it even painful.</p>
<p>Therefore.</p>

<p>“That’s unfair.”</p>

<p>The words that leaked out were accompanied by a piercing pain.</p>
<p>Mimi could not understand “what” it was, so she pulled the blanket over her head to escape her fear.</p>
<p>(What is this? I don’t know, but—it’s painful.)</p>
<p>A throbbing pain.</p>
<p>She felt as if a bud of pain, oozing out from inside her heart, stretched out like black ivy.</p>
