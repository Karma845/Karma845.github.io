<h3>Theater 1</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 1</strong></p>

<p>Indoor (Day)</br>
Fluorescent lighting. Five child actors are lined up side-by-side.</br>
A silver hair girl sighs.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>What fear is. What it means to enjoy fear. That was something I have always been asking myself ever since I became involved with horror. Thus, although just my pet theory, I believe that those two questions are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Fear is for everything that lasted up until yesterday to be destroyed, and for that yesterday to be today. To enjoy fear is to realize that today is an extension of yesterday, yet different than yesterday.</p>
<p>What is it that I want to say?</p>
<p>“Asashiro Juria, six years old! Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>“Yuugao Mimi, six years old. Um, I’ll do my best. Nice to meet chu. Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yoruhata Rin, six years old. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>The three girls beside me cheerfully announced. The three of them have their own unique personality: the lively type, the quiet type, and the cool type. There were many participants besides these children, but I believe that only these three seemed like they knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>Well, at this stage, everyone starts off being mediocre. I think of them like ‘they’ve got themself together, how admirable’, or like ‘wow, how cute’, but nothing more than that. However, if I were to state one complaint.</p>
<p>“Well then, could you tell me about yourself?”</p>
<p>It was a man with a beard showing me a smile that showed he was fond of children. He looked old due to his beard, but most likely, he was one of the few young famous directors. Even though his strictness could not be seen right now, I could tell.</p>
<p>After all, from my many years of coming in contact with people, there were those who had the same inextinguishable flame inside their eyes. There was a time where I made everyone and everything shiver in fear&#8230; but let’s put that aside.</p>
<p>Similar to the other participants, I faced him and took a step forward. I am currently not a horror actress. At that moment, I stepped forward, burdened with my parent’s expectations. I am inexperienced—that’s right, I am a little girl after all.</p>
<p>“Sorahoshi Tsugumi, five years old. Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>As I bowed politely, I could see my parents, who were observing, being deeply moved. As usual, my doting parents were worried, but it was not like I could wave my hand at them so I hope you forgive me with just eye contact.</p>
<p>Sorahoshi Tsugumi, formerly Kirio Tsugumi.</p>
<p>Really, why did it turn out like this?</p>
<p>The actress spirit that I cultivated for many years was stifled by my small sigh.</p>

<p>Hospital Room (Day)<br />
On top of the bed.<br />
Sorahoshi Tsugumi’s Monologue</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>When I woke up, I was enveloped by a sense I was familiar with. The white sheets, beige curtains, white ceiling, and IV bags that I caught at the edge of my eye. It never happened ever since I became famous, but it happened from time to time in my early days when I collapsed from overwork. My house was dirt poor no matter how you framed it. On top of lacking nourishment, I worked too much.</p>
<p>When I looked around, I found a lot of things around the bed, such as many paper cranes, colored paper, fruits, dolls, and so on. I wonder where they came from? I guess the dolls are from a Japanese horror movie.</p>
<p>(Where’s the nurse call… huh?)</p>
<p>As I extended my arm to the bed’s edge, I suddenly noticed a bizarre sight. No no, that can’t be it, give me a moment. I am a woman that would cooperate with ‘the black one’ if it’s for a horror film. <span id='easy-footnote-1-16213' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16213' title='Flowingcloud: I have no idea what this means.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> What are you going to do if you shiver like this? With these chaotic thoughts, there was no way I could keep calm.</p>
<p>After all, I want you to try and imagine. The (if anything, it was losing its elasticity) arm that I was used to seeing had turned into a small, soft, and youthful, pure white arm.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16215" src="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/00014-210x300.jpeg" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/00014-210x300.jpeg 210w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/00014-717x1024.jpeg 717w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/00014-768x1097.jpeg 768w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/00014-1075x1536.jpeg 1075w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/00014.jpeg 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 85vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>(Why did this… no, in the first place.)</p>
<p>Script.</p>
<p>Truck.</p>
<p>Being crushed.</p>
<p>What happened after that?</p>
<p>(If this was a horror film, wouldn’t I be chased around by the destiny of death?) <span id='easy-footnote-2-16213' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16213' title='Slothmaster (Arocks): This author seems to have taken that idea from a movie I will not name “The Final Destination”.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>The sudden flashback of the scene gives me a mild headache. Could it be that I have died once? If so, is this me as a child? Did I have such beautiful, white skin? I feel malnourished as if I were a dead tree though.</p>
<p>How is my body now compared to that? White. Springy. I felt like I was a little skinny, but I don&#8217;t really care about that. Could it be that? The so-called cycle of rebirth mentioned in Buddhism? Me? An atheist with no religion, and have been playing the role of a blasphemous evil spirit or a haunted god? That&#8217;s ridiculous. That&#8217;s a horror story, isn&#8217;t it? <span id='easy-footnote-3-16213' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16213' title='Slothmaster (Arocks): No, it would be a satyr at best. Nowhere near the level of horror.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, I heard a voice. Whose voice is it, I wonder? It was a strange feeling as if it was familiar but not familiar. I don’t know, however, how do I put it, it feels like my body remembers?</p>
<p>As I listened with a light, the curtain was suddenly opened. What I saw there were a beautiful man and woman who were a feast for the eyes. The woman was indeed a yamato nadeshiko beauty with glossy black hair that stuck out over her forehead and fair skin. Her tear-stained cheeks were quite reddened. The man was a different type of beauty. Silver hair and blue eyes. His nose was straight and he was tall. He looked like he had just stepped out of a sculpture. <span id='easy-footnote-4-16213' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16213' title='Flowingcloud: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_nadeshiko&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_nadeshiko&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>(Umm, who was this again—)</p>
<p>“—Daddy, mommy?”</p>
<p>Before my thoughts could come to a conclusion, a lovely voice came from my throat, similar to a bell ringing. Perhaps, could this be my voice? No, if I had a beautiful voice like this, whispering horror should be easy&#8230; wait, that’s not it.</p>
<p>Hearing my voice, my parents—I presume they were my parents—looked at me in amazement. Then, they rushed over to my bed as if their life depended on it and they put their noodlefish-like hands on my cheeks.</p>
<p>“You’re awake!? Ahh, that’s great, my Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi… I was wondering what would happen at one point. I can’t bear it if my angel left this world.”</p>
<p>Most likely, my parents were shedding their tears constantly like that. Even if they were crying, it was picture-perfect. Amazing.</p>
<p>“I… what?”</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, you slipped down the stairs and fell. 13 steps to say no less!”</p>
<p>It’s like that famous story where they’re fine after 97 steps. Nah, I’d die from that.</p>
<p>“Afterward, you continued sleeping for three days. Look, Minako got overwhelmed with worry and folded a thousand cranes.”</p>
<p>Those paper cranes were folded by (probably) my mother. Amazing. <span id='easy-footnote-5-16213' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-16213' title='Slothmaster (Arocks): Is this a horror story, or a comic story? Pick one, author!'><sup>5</sup></a></span>
<p>No, no, no, that’s not the point. I could not help but get confused and lose my train of thought. However, I guess I will just have to accept it having come this far. If I close my eyes and try to remember, certainly, there are this body’s memories. I mean, in terms of taste and personality, this girl was, in all probability, me. I guess this is a reincarnation of myself, living as me even though I had no memories. I could only thank my parents for loving me properly, even though I must have been a strange child.</p>
<p>“So, are there any places that hurt? My angel.”</p>
<p>“Nu-uh.”</p>
<p>“That’s great. Ahh, I will go call the doctor.”</p>
<p>No, but, what is it? I can’t, my brain isn’t functioning well in any way. Perhaps the backlash from recalling my memories, but I feel somewhat feverish.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“I’m… going to sleep.”</p>
<p>However, I made sure to tell them, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me.&#8221; After I said that, my consciousness faded, drowning in the warm darkness.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Hospital Room (Day)<br />
Maxwell (Father) replies to Minako (Mother).</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>“Dear? How’s Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>“She’s sleeping. She seems to have a slight fever.”</p>
<p>I exhaled softly in front of our sleeping angel on the bed. My heart ached as I looked at Tsugumi, who had smiled at us so bravely after all that had happened.</p>
<p>“She was always a sharp kid. She probably took our feelings into consideration.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right, Dear. Tsugumi is our angel, why did this sort of…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say anymore, Minako. I don’t want to see you worrying over it. After all, you are my goddess.” <span id='easy-footnote-6-16213' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-16213' title='Slothmaster (Arocks): Angels and Goddesses? It’s now a religious story? Author, decide already!'><sup>6</sup></a></span>
<p>At the same time I planted a kiss on Minako’s forehead, who was depressed, the doctor came in late. The old man is the person we have the utmost trust in. We silently bowed, told him the situation, then we moved to the corner of the hospital room.</p>
<p>“The fact she woke up means she is probably fine. However, we will continue to keep her hospitalized for this week and watch over her situation.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>After watching the doctor leave, I snuggled up to Tsugumi. Her face is very similar to that of Minako, a Japanese, and she is very cute, but her hair and eyes are similar to mine, platinum blonde hair with sapphire eyes. To us, she is an adorable angel, but apparently, to the masses, she looks &#8220;devilish”.</p>
<p>Her face is beautiful and lovely, and her skin and eyes seem to have lost their color. The fragility and transience of her face, which seems to melt away if you touch her, attracts anyone. To the point where moths lured by the moonlight will forget themselves.</p>
<p>I wish I had not chosen her private tutor just based on their education. I thought that if she was the same gender, nothing unusual would happen, but I did not expect her to push her down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Let’s hire servants only with referrals from someone more reliable.”</p>
<p>“Well then, should we arrange for one from the Sorahoshi main family?”</p>
<p>“You’re right. I have connections I can use there. It is for Tsugumi’s sake after all.”</p>
<p>“Yes. —Let’s do everything we can to ensure that our lovely child does not get hurt, Dear.”</p>
<p>“Ahh.”</p>
<p>Therefore, Tsugumi, please continue smiling innocently forever.</p>
<p>In order to do so, I will get whatever you want.</p>
<p>No matter what method I have to use, you see.</p>
<p>That’s right, when I caress Tsugumi, I can feel my heart stirring in delight.</p>
<p>Please, I wish you happiness in your future.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 2</strong></p>

<p>Reminiscence: Western-style Building (Evening)<br />
A middle-aged woman’s face is hidden by the evening’s backlight.<br />
Tsugumi chases after that woman. Reminiscence over → Hospital Room (Evening)</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>&#8220;How lovely.”</p>
<p>&#8220;How adorable.”</p>
<p>&#8220;How sweet.”</p>
<p>&#8220;How…”</p>
<p>&#8220;How…”</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohh, ohh, Tsugumi-sama. Please be mine.”</p>
<p>&#8220;What should I do? How can I get you to smile at me?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahh, that’s right. If only you could live in my world.”</p>
<p>A woman with a crazy smile on her face chased after me, who did not know anything. As I was chased to the stairs, she pushed my body. Her crazy smile was something to behold. She has the talent to act as one of the “mental” actresses.</p>
<p>She was… if I remember correctly&#8230; She was my private tutor. A tutor that my father arranged for me. She was a teacher who was arranged for me in order to prepare for an event that I never heard of in my past life—elementary school entrance exams. She is a veteran tutor from a famous university who has been studying for 30 years. It seems that she had a preference for potential little girls (shoujo), and fell in love with Sorahoshi Tsugumi, a lovely Scandinavian beauty, and got herself into a mess. <span id='easy-footnote-1-16488' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16488' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): Tsugumi is five right now. The term shoujo refers to girls who are 7~18 of age. This b*tch is the pedo of the pedos.'><sup>1</sup></a></span> Thus, it must have been quite a reasonable burden to my childish personality, reviving my memories from my previous life. Tough luck.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fever occurring and my deep sleep, I was able to sort out my memories. I opened my eyelids as if waking up from a daydream and saw the white ceiling for the second time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yaw&#8230;n.”</p>
<p>When I yawned loudly, the IV inevitably got in the way. Hmm&#8230; I am good at getting down on all fours in a bridge position with the IV in, but I would get in trouble if they find me doing that. I will have to give up my light exercise.</p>
<p>I would feel guilty to use the nurse call button just to ask someone to come. Helplessly, I looked around the bed and saw a lovely calendar. It seemed that this girl in this life and me from my previous life liked the same animals. I saw a cute print of a snake, raven, and frog. Mom and dad, I’m sorry for liking such ominous animals.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, what year is it now, I wonder? —2020… Ehh?”</p>
<p>The era name… Reiwa, what’s that? What about Heisei? Well, even in this life&#8217;s memory, I did think that the TVs were quite thin and cell phones were awfully small, but I see, it’s been 20 years… If it has been that long since I was alive, my acquaintances and friends must be old or at a decent age. I, well, was never really young either.</p>
<p>Well, if that’s the case, I wondered what happened in the horror industry? If I said that I liked horror films that were famous in my time, I wonder if I’ll be mocked as a boomer?</p>
<p>“I want to watch TV…”</p>
<p>It was not just horror. How far have cell phones advanced? What about the internet? Also, what about VHS? A world I do not know. How fun it would be to be filled with entertainment with a sense of values that I do not comprehend. I wondered how exciting it would be to be able to come in contact with films that had developed and evolved over the years.</p>
<p>I rummaged around my bed and found a few picture books. Grimm&#8217;s Fairy Tales, Andersen, and Shakespeare. They were all masterpieces that had been handed down to my generation. From among them, I opened a picture book that I picked up randomly. I knew that the only way to contain my excitement was through theater. <span id='easy-footnote-2-16488' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16488' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): This is the “Andersen” Tsugumi is talking about if you didn’t know: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Slothmaster (Arocks): Damn, this would be the perfect time to bring out the Matrix Mr. Anderson meme.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“Sleeping Beauty. Mhm, this is good.” <span id='easy-footnote-3-16488' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16488' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): Sleeping Beauty is in Grimm’s Fairy Tales.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>It feels repulsive to call myself a beauty, but I was just sleeping at first. Even though I am good at getting into my role, if there is a situation setting that is easy to get into, there’s nothing better than that.</p>
<p>I am a sleeping princess. I was cursed by an evil witch on my birthday and put to sleep for a hundred years. Then, a prince appears, and with his kiss, I awaken beautifully.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Did you kiss me?]”</p>
<p>I put my hand on the prince&#8217;s cheek, then he squeezed my hand back.</p>
<p>“[I had been cursed by a witch to sleep.]”</p>
<p>I lightly complained to his kind gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It was a lonely, ice-cold, cruel curse.]”</p>
<p>When the prince saw the sorrow in my words, he said, &#8220;You don’t have to worry anymore. From now on, I will protect you.”</p>
<p>“[Yes.]” I told the beautiful prince. My lips trembled, and I surrendered myself in joy and love. Happiness filled my heart, and I embraced the dawn as a ray of light shines through the darkness of my heart.</p>
<p>“—It’s my angel.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice called out to me, and I stepped down from my role. Without even time to think that being a heroine wasn&#8217;t my thing, a familiar beautiful man knelt before me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohh, Tsugumi, my angel. Who are you going to win over with those lovely eyes of yours?”</p>
<p>He is the kind of person that would die if I randomly gave a name. Because I thought that would actually happen for some reason or another, I settled on something safe.</p>
<p>“Daddy and mommy!”</p>
<p>“Well well, am I already Tsugumi’s captive? Here, hugggg—”</p>
<p>My mother appeared behind my father and gave me a hug. My father was taken aback, but he easily got up and joined the circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I dreaming right now? My goddess and my angel are playing together in such a lovely way? Would you two let me join in?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hehe, what should I do? What do you think, Tsugumi?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hehe, I&#8217;ll give you special permission!”</p>
<p>“Ohh, dear. Oh, how kind of you two to show such concern for someone like me&#8230; Now, will you give me your angel’s embrace too?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!”</p>
<p>I wonder if this is what an innocent child feels like. I don&#8217;t think it was like this, but it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m acting 100 percent of the time. Although I try not to show my shyness, my desire to play with my warm parents is something that overflows from deep inside me.</p>
<p>After all, I was an abused child in my previous life. Just when my violent father passed away, my mother abandoned me. If my grandparents had not saved me, I would have died. Just as I was about to take up acting and support my grandparents, they passed away peacefully. It was true that I longed for a family.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, that truly was wonderful acting. Does Tsugumi perhaps want to go into acting?”</p>
<p>When asked, I thought for a moment. I am sure there are many more options now than in my previous life. Wouldn&#8217;t it be a waste not to try them out? Those kinds of thoughts flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>However, such thoughts were being drowned out by the overflowing impulse in my heart. I still wanted to be an actor. I wanted to fulfill my dream of becoming an actress who instills fear in every person in Hollywood, something I could not achieve in my previous life. <span id='easy-footnote-4-16488' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16488' title='Slothmaster (Arocks): She might instill a lot of things into the people in Hollywood, though I doubt it would be ‘fear’.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>Therefore, I have no regrets about how I answered. I am sure they will let me take acting lessons. If I studied now, if I trained now, how much ability will I be able to obtain? I could not help but be excited just by thinking about it.</p>

<p>Hospital Room (Night)</p>
<p>Father peeks at the bed through the door gap.</p>
<p>The setting sun hits the father’s face from the side who is looking at the Tsumugi.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>&#8220;[Did you kiss me?]”</p>
<p>The bed in the hospital room looked like it was a bed covered with thorns.</p>
<p>“[I had been cursed by a witch to sleep.]”</p>
<p>Wet eyes. The words she spun. I almost sympathized with the pain as if it was cutting at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;[It was a lonely, ice-cold, cruel curse.]”</p>
<p>I could not hear the prince’s voice. Even though that should have been the case, I had a flickering visual hallucination of the beautiful prince taking her hand.</p>
<p>—You don’t have to worry anymore. From now on, I will protect you.</p>
<p>I should not have been able to hear it, but it resounded as if following my sympathetic soul.</p>
<p>“[Yes.]”</p>
<p>Then, long-awaited words were sweet and mesmerizing.</p>
<p>&#8220;A foolish witch. Binding her to her sleep then setting her aside.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure&#8230; that&#8217;s not the intention of the story, Minako.”</p>
<p>Minako was peeking together at the other side of the hospital room. I came to my senses at Minako’s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;The witch was jealous, you see. Jealous of Tsugumi&#8217;s beauty.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hehe, if you want to make our Tsugumi the main character, that would ruin the story. It would be foolish to get caught up in beauty and ugliness. If you confronted Tsugumi, you would realize that you’re just an insignificant ant.”</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s no doubt in that.”</p>
<p>Tsugumi was oblivious to our husband-wife harmonious banter. Therefore, when I gave Minako a look, she smiled softly and took a step back.</p>
<p>“But it was a really great performance. Does Tsugumi perhaps want to act?”</p>
<p>After a few exchanges, I asked Tsugumi. Then, Minako understood my intentions and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>If you said no, then we would take you to the best film festival. So that you would not be bored with the pleasure of watching.</p>
<p>If you said you do not know, we will watch over you and see where you go. So that you can choose again in the future.</p>
<p>However, if you nod your head…</p>
<p>&#8220;Mhm.”</p>
<p>—I&#8217;m going to prepare the best stage for you. So that my angel will shine on the silver screen.</p>

<p>Hospital Room (Morning)<br />
Tsumugi wakes up and stares at the ceiling.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>I sighed as I stared blankly at the white ceiling. After a night&#8217;s sleep, I woke up and made sure this was not a dream. The reflection in the hand mirror was of a platinum-blond-haired girl with blue eyes. Also, if you look closely, you can see that this is a private room. A very expensive room.</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, eating hospital food, and getting diagnosed, I had no time for anything else. In my free time, when I racked my brains and tried to remember at least a little bit about myself, information came pouring out.</p>
<p>My name is Tsugumi Sorahoshi Lowell. Oddly enough, I had the same first name as my previous life. My father was Maxwell and my mother was Minako. I’m what you would call a half. My age is five, blood type B, and my favorite things are frogs, snakes, and ravens. I&#8217;m the kind of kid who gets excited about ghost stories. It was kind of like, how should I put it, me without memories. I’m in preschool and I have a private tutor at home, but she pushed me down the stairs and awakened my memories of my previous life. <span id='easy-footnote-1-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16697' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): The name for her is in First, Last format because that’s how the author wanted it. Also, yes, Japanese people have this weird thing to purposely point out half-Japanese people. It’s kinda this racist thing ingrained in their blood. Calling someone a “half” is not very PC.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>Did I hit something hard and revive my memory? If that&#8217;s the case, then I&#8217;m worried about my own head, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the main cause—then, as I was deeply thinking about it, I heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Tsugumi, you look like you’re doing fine.”</p>
<p>“Ah, mommy! Morning!”</p>
<p>The person that entered the room was my mother, a beautiful Japanese woman with dark hair. She sat down next to me with a gentle smile on her face and patted my head to check how I was doing. When a beauty does this to me, I felt, how do you put it, somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<p>However, I just regained my memories as an adult, but on the outside, I&#8217;m still a child, a child that these people dote on. As an actress, I&#8217;ll do my best so that they see me as their child.</p>
<p>“Since you&#8217;ve been asleep for so long, let&#8217;s practice in the hospital to see if you can walk outside properly.”</p>
<p>“Practice?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If your legs hurt when you walk or it&#8217;s difficult to walk, you have to properly tell Mommy, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>I see, you mean rehabilitation. It&#8217;s true that if I don&#8217;t walk, my body will deteriorate. In my previous life… well, I was poor and in distress, so I felt like I was walking around looking for food. It&#8217;s the complete opposite of what I’m going to do now.</p>
<p>I put on my slippers and my mother held me by the hand and started walking. I was worried that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep my balance, but even with the change of my line of sight, I seemed to manage one way or another. <span id='easy-footnote-2-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16697' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): She’s talking about her height. She thought Adult → Child height would cause her to lose her balance.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>(Rather&#8230;)</p>
<p>Maybe this body has pretty high specs to begin with. If I look, I can see far and clear. If I imagine how I want to move my body, I can do exactly that. Even though I should have no physical strength at all, I felt as if my body was constantly improving itself to its best condition.</p>
<p>Just by walking, I feel as if my awareness went all the way to the tips of my hair. I wonder how much it would change if I ran or jumped. Even in yesterday&#8217;s improv play, I could not believe how much my voice had grown&#8230; Could this be something great? Even after all this time, I can still feel my face become stiff.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, how do you feel?”</p>
<p>“I feel super good, Mommy!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, is that so? Well then, shall we make our way to the courtyard?”</p>
<p>My mother led me by the hand and we walked out into the courtyard of the hospital. I wore a coat over my hospital gown, but I felt a little chilly. Come to think of it, it&#8217;s only February&#8230;</p>
<p>In the courtyard, people, who seemed to be also hospitalized patients, were spending their time as they pleased. There were people in wheelchairs, elderly people with walkers, and children about my age. Even after twenty years, I guess this sort of scene has not changed much.</p>
<p>“Sorahoshi-san.” <span id='easy-footnote-3-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16697' title='Cloud: Sorahoshi is Tsugumi’s middle name. Sorahoshi-san would be Tsugumi’s mother.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>“Ah, sensei.” <span id='easy-footnote-4-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-16697' title='Cloud: “Sensei” does not only mean teacher, but is also an honorific used for doctors, authors and various other professions.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>“May I have a word with you?”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mother greeted the doctor in charge. I believe his name was Kunimoto-sensei, or something like that. He was an old man, but he was polite and kind enough to directly talk to me—a child.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, go and play in the area.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s going to talk about what’ll happen from here, money, and other things too sensitive for a child to hear. I replied cheerfully, reading the situation, then took a step forward to head towards the children around the same age.</p>
<p>The sensation of kicking the earth.The sensation of it transmitting through my slippers. My instincts tell me that if I start running at this speed, I&#8217;ll fall, thus I instinctively slowed down.</p>
<p>(H-Huh?)</p>
<p>One more step. It’s normal this time. Then, little by little, I increased my gear. It&#8217;s like prancing, but with this body moving with perfect balance, I think I can really jump around. I can&#8217;t try it here, but I&#8217;m sure I can do somersaults and handsprings with ease. With my hands behind my back, I might even be able to do a &#8220;telephone pole”, bunny hopping and landing on my head then bouncing back up. <span id='easy-footnote-5-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-16697' title='Cloud: I was too lazy to look this up so do your own research.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>
<p>With this body, I would be able to reproduce many of the techniques that I had tried so hard to acquire in my previous life, on top of strengthening them. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about, high speed off the bridge. <span id='easy-footnote-6-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-16697' title='Cloud: Dw, I’m also too lazy to look up these references.'><sup>6</sup></a></span>
<p>&#8220;—Just give it to me!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, my thoughts were interrupted by a voice I heard. It seemed that a boy in casual clothes was trying to grab a doll that a girl in a hospital gown was holding. I don&#8217;t know which one of them it belongs to, but is that a monster made of soft vinyl or something? No, it might be some kind of mascot character. It was an indescribable creature with the tail of a dinosaur and the body of a polar bear.</p>
<p>As they fought over the doll, it somehow slipped out their hands and fell at my feet. I picked it up to give it back to them, but they had obviously backed away, looking at me and the doll in turn. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>&#8220;Shit, a foreigner.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, she’s so pretty…”</p>
<p>Ah, I see. Foreign girls are hard to talk to, aren’t they? However, if I don’t do so, I think I need to be the one that begins the conversation… I need to get some information to find out whose doll this is. Besides, they’re going to continue fighting when I hand it over so it’s complicated.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m going to go to all the trouble, I might as well try to do something to stop them from fighting. There were many techniques that the horror actress Kirio Tsugumi had acquired. Some of them are as follows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello.” (In actual English)</p>
<p>&#8220;Eek, a foreign language!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Uwa, uwa!”</p>
<p>First, is to greet them with “hello” in English. Then, I hold up the doll and show it to them. Ah, the name of the doll is engraved on the bottom of the foot. Bearsaurus. <span id='easy-footnote-7-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-16697' title='Cloud: Yes, the name is literally Bear-saurus. Bear + Dinosaur (specifically T-Rex) = Bearsaurus.'><sup>7</sup></a></span>
<p>&#8220;[Hi, I&#8217;m Bearsaurus. What is your name?]”</p>
<p>&#8220;I-It talkeddddd!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Awawawawawawawawawawawa!?”</p>
<p>The children jumped back in an easy-to-understand manner, and then, timidly approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Can you tell me your names?]”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yu-s, I’m Tatsuki!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m, Kanako!”</p>
<p>“[Tatsuki and Kanako, right!?]”</p>
<p>I was moving the dool while ventriloquizing, but I was surprised by how my throat operated several times better than I imagined. Even though I was supposed to not be used to this kind of throat movement, my body was able to follow the movements I wanted to do with more than 100 percent accuracy. I&#8217;m becoming more and more aware of this, but isn&#8217;t this something amazing?</p>
<p>&#8220;[Why were you two fighting?]”</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s because keeping Bearsarus to herself…”</p>
<p>“Hmph! Onii-chan brought it home last week though!”</p>
<p>Wow, aren’t you really popular, Bearsarus-kun. It&#8217;s a combination of cute and cool, right? If you ask me, I could kind of see it… Hmm, well whatever.</p>
<p>A lovely older brother and younger sister pair. The sister is hospitalized and the Onii-chan is visiting her. If possible, I’d want to be impartial and have them play together on good terms, but well then, what should I do?</p>
<p>&#8220;[Hmm, but I love both of you though.]”</p>
<p>A depressed tone. Lower the voice volume. As Bearsarus hung its head, they looked away awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;[I&#8217;ll be lonely if the two of you fight over me.]”</p>
<p>“W-We’re not fighting!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Mhm.”</p>
<p>Tatsuki-kun was upset and Kanako-chan was depressed. As if to interrupt them, I raised my voice, &#8220;[Ah, that&#8217;s right],&#8221; and just as I had hoped, they both looked at Bearsarus.</p>
<p>—Then, at the same time, my voice was transmitted to the surroundings. “Oh my,” a nearby nurse muttered. An old man with a cane whispered to himself, “I wonder what’s going to happen?” then turned towards the Onii-chan who backed off from Bearsarus. The movements of the puppets, after that the voice. This is a method of making the performer—me—disappear from view, creating a world of just the doll and the children.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Tatsuki-kun and Nanako-chan, let&#8217;s take turns staying together! How about it? Like this, I&#8217;ll be happy to be with the two of you forever!]”</p>
<p>The two of them looked at each other as Bearsarus loudly advocated for a solution. Then, they nodded at each other.</p>
<p>“All right, then, I’ll let Kanako have it next.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks, Onii-chan!”</p>
<p>A small round of applause echoed around us. When I held out Bearsarus to Kanako-chan, she happily accepted it.</p>
<p>“[I can&#8217;t talk anymore, but I&#8217;ll always be by your side.]”</p>
<p>&#8220;Mhm.”</p>
<p>Then, she quietly separated from the crowd. The people were looking at the doll and the two of them. The older brother and younger sister made up with each other. Afterward, some people applauded me as well. I&#8217;m just someone who works behind-the-scenes, so I give a small bow and ran off.</p>
<p>My body in this life really can move better than I thought. I can do more things than I imagined. I had a sweet-honeyed hallucination that I could make it to Hollywood, more easily than in my previous life. However, there are infinite possibilities, is it okay to have the same dream as my previous life?</p>
<p>(I wonder what my current father and mother would think.)</p>
<p>I wondered if I could call myself a normal child for trying to enter the world of acting now. Wouldn&#8217;t it make these two good people sad if their beloved child suddenly started saying strange things?</p>
<p>In my previous life, er, well, “up until the other day” personally speaking, I was trying to make it into Hollywood. However, that life is over now and I&#8217;m living as a new person. I&#8217;m going to continue living. If that&#8217;s the case, isn&#8217;t going to school like a normal person, getting married like a normal person, showing my grandchildren to the two of them&#8230; isn’t being a normal girl like the best way to repay my parents?</p>
<p>(If that’s the case, I would seal off Kirio Tsugumi’s dream—and, what would I aim for then?)</p>
<p>It was painful. I was born into a happy family, but what am I supposed to do after that? Can I give up my dream? These thoughts clung to me like mud and became chains that pulled me down. It doesn’t look like I could come up with an answer at the moment.</p>
<p>After that, I had just been discharged in a daze, went to the hospital for checkups, and could finally catch my breath when I got home. I was sitting on my bed that has a canopy affixed to it, pondering how I could coax my parents to let me read the newspaper article when I heard a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“I’m here!”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Tsugumi-sama.”</p>
<p>“Mikado-san! It&#8217;s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it has been a while, Tsugumi-sama.”</p>
<p>The person who appeared from the other side of the luxurious door was Mikado Haruna-san, the servant who takes care of me (in a genuine maid&#8217;s uniform no less). If I remember correctly, she returned to her hometown due to family business on the day I collapsed I think.</p>
<p>I was worried about her because she seemed to have regretted it when she came to visit me, but she seemed to have recovered somehow.</p>
<p>“I have been informed that you are going out today.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Is that so? Where are I going?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, the location is a secret, is how it’s supposed to be. Now then, let&#8217;s get you dressed up.”</p>
<p>A secret location&#8230; Is this a surprise?</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m looking forward to it,&#8221; I told Mikado-san while I thought for a moment. Come to think of it, she said she was going to do something to celebrate my discharge from the hospital. I hope the party isn’t too formal, but I still haven’t grasped how rich people operate in this world.</p>
<p>Even the size of this house is unclear for me. After all, there is a limit to the knowledge a child can acquire. Wherever I go today, I&#8217;ll see the standards of this world.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re looking beautiful today as well, Tsugumi-sama.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Thanks, Mikado-san.”</p>
<p>The frills on my skirt of my white dress swayed softly as I spun around in front of the mirror. A stitched ornament and pink ribbon, then I put on a fluffy coat on top of everything. A white broad-brimmed hat and a white pouch with a flower brooch attached. It was all white. As I was in a Western-style building, I thought that I would be wearing shoes inside, but contrary to my expectations, I was wearing slippers inside. Well, my mother is Japanese after all.</p>
<p>I left my room and went to the living room, with Mikado-san following me. As soon as Mikado-san opened the door—which looked luxurious and heavy—for me, I saw my parents in their elegant suits. They were an extremely handsome man and beautiful woman, but I seemed to have picked the best of both their appearances&#8230; Although this may be late, I was worried that I would be bullied at school for being too exotic. <span id='easy-footnote-8-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-8-16697' title='Cloud: Another example of Japanese views on foreigners. Just being a foreigner already makes you weird, and looking beautiful on top of that? I don’t need to spell out the rest for you, do I?&lt;br /&gt;
Slothmaster (Arocks): I wonder if we’re trolls. Both this and Alchemist are perfectly good stories, but Cloudy and I can’t help retort and comment and denounce the stories… Even though we actually love them!'><sup>8</sup></a></span>
<p>“Ohh, you look charming today as well, my angel.”</p>
<p>“You look lovely, Tsugumi. Well now, properly show Mommy.”</p>
<p>I did as I was told and spun around and kissed them on their cheek and played around. I don&#8217;t know what a normal parent and child acts but I&#8217;m sure this is normal. In my previous life, I may have been in very harsh circumstances, I thought to myself now, although a bit too late.</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s go then, shall we?”</p>
<p>“Okay, dear.”</p>
<p>I left through the entrance hall and out the marble entranceway, accompanied by the two who were in a good mood. I change into a pair of cute white loafers. We’re currently in the latter half of February, and I dressed up just right for the chillness outside. However, I was embarrassed to discover that anything and everything I had was girlish and that it unbelievably suited my appearance.</p>
<p>We left the Western-style house and passed through a nice garden that would make one ask, &#8220;&#8230;Am I in a forest?”, under a green arch, then a large, elegant fence opened automatically. A large white limousine was parked there, and the driver, an elderly gentleman named Makabe-san, opened the door for me. It&#8217;s amazing how they’re naturally using a limousine as their private car&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, Mommy, where are we going today?”</p>
<p>“Haha, it&#8217;s a secret, you see.”</p>
<p>“But, it&#8217;s somewhere Tsugumi would like.”</p>
<p>Sitting side by side on the limousine sofa, I listened to my parents&#8217; conversation. It seemed certain that it’s a surprise, but well now, I wondered what they thought would make me happy.　In my previous life, my hobby was watching horror movies. However, I didn&#8217;t know anything about horror movies in this life, so I didn&#8217;t know what I was really interested in, and I felt like I was randomly reading a lot of books.</p>
<p>I wonder what else is there? Maybe a frog, raven, and snake museum? I think women generally would be scared of them, but my mother in this life was fine with them, so I thought that was normal before my memory came back.</p>
<p>“It seems like we’re almost there.”</p>
<p>My father suddenly announced as I was relaxing while drinking a non-alcoholic cocktail (They had some in the car, that’s amazing.). I emptied my glass in a hurry and neatly fixed the hems of my clothes. My parents would be embarrassed if their rich daughter showed up in a shabby outfit.</p>
<p>As my mother combed my hair with her hands while her lips loosened, the scenery outside came to a halt without a sound nor tremor. It seemed that we had arrived at some kind of entrance. Makabe-san opened the door for me, followed by my mother and father escorting me out. Then, the eyes of the people in the surroundings were drawn to me.</p>
<p>Those types of gazes were&#8230; curiosity, admiration, astonishment, anxiety, and fear. Hehe, I wonder where their emotion of fear comes from? I didn&#8217;t know this before, but it seems that I have extraordinary talent in this life, and I can tell a lot of things just by the kind of gaze I get, even without looking at their expressions. Someday, I will finish dying all your gazes in fear. Hehehehehe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re having fun, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“Did something catch your eye?”</p>
<p>Oops, it leaked out. I need to stop being so careless.</p>
<p>“Not really. But, I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing what&#8217;s there!”</p>
<p>At my words, my father smiled and patted my head. I felt like the gazes around me changed, but… I wonder what’s up? Curiosity with a side of favoritism, or something like that?</p>
<p>Well anyway, Father quickly finished registering and led my mother and me inside. My father perfectly matched my child&#8217;s pace, he surely must be a very popular person&#8230;</p>
<p>We took the elevator and after a short walk, we saw a large door. The name of the venue was affixed to the top of the door. I couldn&#8217;t see it clearly even if I tiptoed and stretched myself as much as I could. My mother softly picked me up. I&#8217;m five years old now, I&#8217;m sorry that I’m so heavy&#8230;</p>
<p>“Err… new-year-serial-drama-child-actor-audition-venue…”</p>
<p>New Year.</p>
<p>Serial.</p>
<p>Drama.</p>
<p>Child actor.</p>
<p>Auditions.</p>
<p>Venue!?</p>
<p>“You read those characters properly, well done.”</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have time to come to my senses at Father&#8217;s words, and the door was thrown open, while I was still in confusion. Inside, there were several pairs of parents and children. They were my rivals for the upcoming audition.</p>
<p>Can I really aim to be an actress in this lifetime? Shouldn&#8217;t I live as a normal girl? This smoldering discord in the back of my mind was unleashed along with the remains of my former dream. At the same time, a part of my thought changed instantaneously. I am currently exerting myself to gain a role. I left behind my veteran actress life where offers would come rolling back in my previous life. My soul reminded me that I was now in the same situation as when I was just starting out, where I had to acquire my own spoils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mommy.”</p>
<p>&#8220;? All right, go on.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>I let go of my mother&#8217;s hand. The gazes were still on me. If that’s the case, this is the moment to make this the highlight scene. The innocence that colored my expression. This is the moment for me to show off my innocence and the advantage of being a child. I prepared myself, gently brushing the edge of my skirt, then put my hands in front of me.</p>
<p>So the spectators could see my movements, their gaze shifted from my hands to my waist, from my waist to my chest, then from my chest to my face. As I moved, I smiled and bowed my head vigorously.</p>
<p>“My name is Sorahoshi Tsugumi! It&#8217;s a pleasure to meet you today!”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;(Huh?)”</p>
<p>I looked up and tilted my head. I thought it was going to be a fight for the mount, but there was no counterattack from anywhere. The only thing I heard was a small sigh, as if releasing heat, that made my earlobe tremble.</p>
<p>“You’ve already made everyone your prisoner…That&#8217;s my angel.”</p>
<p>“That was a splendid greeting, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, I might have gone too far with this. But. Should everyone desperate for an opportunity to be on TV and possibly be given a role be more desperate? There aren’t many other ways to spread my reputation besides TV and radio. Magazines don&#8217;t have the same influence as TV after all.</p>
<p>Or, is this for a local program? Maybe it&#8217;s a small station since I was able to attend without even having to practice beforehand. But well, the building is magnificent, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Even if you tell me I’m being too childish, there’s nothing I can do about it. I wonder why, but compared to my previous life, my self-control has really degraded. Controlling your emotions is the foundation for an actress. My mental age may have been brought down by my new young body. From now on, let&#8217;s keep an eye on what&#8217;s going on around me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I see everyone has gathered. Now then, everyone will be divided into groups of five, then we’ll be moving the location of the audition venue. The audition is divided into an interview and a practical test. The practical test will include speech, singing, and various tests, but at the current stage, technique is not the… everyone?”</p>
<p>The young staff member who entered the room gave a quick explanation, but I noticed that the reaction was somewhat slow before looking up at him. Finally, everyone, except us, sporadically started to react, and the staff member tilted his head in confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Err, well, we&#8217;ve divided the groups according to age and other factors. However, due to the number of participants, we will have one group of four people. At the current planning stage, the script will be written according to the cast, thus we have not decided on the number of successful applicants yet. Therefore, we are trying to create a place where the children can have a no-pressure performance… Well then, handouts will be handed out at the entrance, so please move to the booth with the venue and your name written on it.”</p>
<p>I see, their stance is to have us not be rivals, but to cooperate. I just didn&#8217;t know about it because this audition was a surprise from my father and mother, but I wonder if the others knew about it? If so, it&#8217;s understandable that they wouldn&#8217;t make the preemptive jab.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t blatantly pick a fight. They might have concluded that I was someone who couldn&#8217;t cooperate.</p>
<p>“What, it&#8217;s not a contest?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hehe, it would be pitiful for the other children if it was, Dear.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s true.”</p>
<p>&#8230;Father, Mother, I&#8217;m glad you both have a high opinion of me, but it hasn&#8217;t even started, okay? When I was working as an actress, at times, there was an extraordinary child actor. They were someone whose acting ability could put adults to shame and have a child-like vigor. They were the only ones who weren&#8217;t scared of me when filming with her, thus we co-starred many times. <span id='easy-footnote-9-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-9-16697' title='Slothmaster (Arocks): We’re using ‘they’ since the gender of the child actor/actress isn’t actually known… That said, I feel like a flag has been raised…'><sup>9</sup></a></span>
<p>What I should be aiming for now is to be a child actor like her. I think that person should be just about thirty years old right now. I can&#8217;t wait to buy their video. I&#8217;m sure the TV/VCR combo televisions are getting more efficient. I&#8217;m rich, so maybe I&#8217;ll get a laser disk. I want to see her in action. <span id='easy-footnote-10-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-10-16697' title='Cloud: Holy sh*t, is she a boomer?

<p>“Group D, right? It looks like the other girls are already here.”</p>
<p>“The actress Asashiro Satsuki is there. Do you think she’s bringing out her daughter?”</p>
<p>“Even if she is, she&#8217;s not Tsugumi&#8217;s enemy.” <span id='easy-footnote-11-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-11-16697' title='Cloud: I can’t tell whether the author is trying to meme and saying she’s not an enemy as in “not a match for Tsugumi” or “they’re cooperating together”.

<p>I looked in the direction of their gazes after noticing the voices of my parents who were speaking at volume so perfect that it was not audible to those around them. A woman with bright red hair and a girl smiling cheerfully at her feet. Maybe they were fellow friends, but there were two close-looking girls around her.</p>
<p>One was a quiet-looking girl with glasses and her hair tied into two. The other girl had glossy black hair and slanted eyes and looked a bit strong-willed. Their personalities are well-divided: the lively type, the quiet type, and the cool type. I think I&#8217;ll go with the impish type. Evil spirits are also acceptable. I think I&#8217;ll say hello and join the circle. <span id='easy-footnote-12-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-12-16697' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): Fun puns from the author. 小悪魔 means devil/imp. 悪霊 means evil spirit.

<p>“Everyone in Group D. Thank you for applying for this audition today. We would like to begin with a brief interview, so will the children please introduce themselves.”</p>
<p>I stopped my feet that were heading to greet them, and turned to the staff who came to explain. He was a young male staff member, with a cameraman and a sound staff beside him. They seemed to be filming this for the time being and there was also a bearded man who seemed to be the director.</p>
<p>Looking around, the other groups seemed to be doing the same, and it seems like one group has only four people. But yeah, this group was perhaps a little different from the others.</p>
<p>“Well then, could you tell me about yourself?”</p>
<p>The bearded man who asked this question looked older because of his beard, but his actual age was probably much younger. If you look at the other groups, you can see that the facilitator was a staff member who guided the group, but this group is supervised by this person. I could sense that he has some sort of special intention.</p>
<p>“Asashiro Juria, six years old! Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>“Yuugao Mimi, six years old. Um, I’ll do my best. Nice to meet chu. Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yoruhata Rin, six years old. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>There was no hesitation in the three of them as they answered clearly. Unlike the rest of the groups, these three must have some kind of experience or talent. They knew exactly what they came here for and what to do.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the director. He has a friendly smile on his face, but deep in his eyes, you could see a stern determination like flames. All directors who produce masterpieces have that kind of passion in their eyes.</p>
<p>“Well then, could you tell me about yourself?”</p>
<p>Similar to the other participants, I faced him and took a step forward. I was, at that time, not a horror actress. At that moment, I stepped forward, burdened with my parent’s expectations. I am inexperienced—that’s right, I’m a little girl after all.</p>
<p>What I need is not the greeting of a veteran, but a greeting of the girl who was about to take a brave step forward.</p>
<p>“Sorahoshi Tsugumi, five years old. Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>As I bowed politely, I could see the parents watching over me looking rather touched. As usual, I was worried about my doting parents, but since I couldn&#8217;t wave to them, I hope they forgive me with me just secretly winking.</p>
<p>I am no longer the horror actress Kirio Tsugumi.<br />
From now on, I will take my first step as the fresh child actor Sorahoshi Tsugumi.<br />
In order to live up to the expectations of my parents who love this weird child, I will do my best to gain this role.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>&#8220;Man, Tsugumi-chan, was it? I feel pretty sorry about her.”</p>
<p>After the brief interview, as I&#8217;m getting ready for the next one, the audition staff began talking to me. Today&#8217;s audition was a fixed game for the so-called ‘second-generation child actors’. In order to make the setting a school, we recruited many child actors, but the main actors are those three.</p>
<p>When that becomes the case, our current attention would be on the children of actresses and actors that would be under the spotlight. At any rate, the chances of finding a child with exceptional talent is more difficult than winning the lottery. I’ll be lucky if we find one.</p>
<p>For this reason, the auditions were held in groups of five, and only the three of them were assigned to individual groups, so that I, the director, meet them as well as keep an eye on them. Of course, if they were very awful, I plan on dropping them, but judging from their answers, I didn&#8217;t think that would be necessary. At the very least, child actors should be able to remember their lines and do what they are told.</p>
<p>The only daughter of Asashiro Satsuki, an actress in the morning drama series, Asashiro Juria.</p>
<p>She is a bright red-haired girl like her mother, and probably the leading character.</p>
<p>The only daughter of the queen of afternoon soap dramas, Yuugao Natsu, Yuugao Mimi.</p>
<p>She has a docile look but resembles Natsu in her childhood. She will probably become a seductive actress in the future.</p>
<p>The daughter of actor Yoruhata Kazuma, the face of Getsuku, and announcer Yoruhata Maho, Yoruhata Rin. <span id='easy-footnote-13-16697' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-13-16697' title='Slavemaster (Cloud): Getsuki refers to Monday at 9pm. This is when the most popular TV dramas air in Japan since baseball games aren’t played on Monday in Japan, thus there will never be a delay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getsuku&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getsuku&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>13</sup></a></span>
<p>She has a strong-willed look like her mother, but sweet-looking lips like her father. She seems to be a clever girl.</p>
<p>I see. They&#8217;re all good. I can understand why they call this a fixed game. No, maybe that&#8217;s why. I raised the corner of my mouth to answer the staff member who casually talked to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we don&#8217;t know yet.”</p>
<p>“Eh? But…”</p>
<p>“If you have a pair of eyes, the quota can decrease—or it may increase. That was the promise, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes.”</p>
<p>In front of that talent, the audacity of those who refer to this as a fixed game would be filled with awe.</p>
<p>The movement of her gaze, her grasp of the situation, the way she carries herself like an agitated sword fighter, the smile hidden under the vibrant lily flower. He thought that she was unlucky after being thrown into the group I was overseeing because she suddenly took part, but that may not be the case. The ones being tested are us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can decide on the theme of the next test, correct?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. You said to prepare some simple lines, right?”</p>
<p>“No. I&#8217;m going to change things up a bit.”</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>I was wondering how this job was going to turn out, but it looks like I’m going to have a lot of fun.</p>

Tsumugi makes up her mind and talks to the other child actors.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>The room was a little wider than usual. Desks were lined up in a row. From the corner of my eye, I could see props being prepared little by little. As I watched from the sidelines, I decided to go and greet the girls who were a year older than me.</p>
<p>After checking with my parents, I found out that their parents were in the entertainment industry. Moreover, the parents and the children were very close to each other. I see, I predicted it! &#8230;But I don&#8217;t think the kids would care about that kind of behind-the-scenes information. While my parents, who were strangely powerful, were curbing the other parents who were accompanying their children, let’s try interacting with them.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>When I called out to them, Mimi-chan, the quiet-type girl, hid behind Juria-chan, the lively-type girl, then Rin-chan, the cool girl, shook her head exasperated.</p>
<p>“Hi! Mom said it was going to be the three of us, but looks like there’s more!”</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s something you probably shouldn&#8217;t say. I hid such thoughts behind my smile and responded to Juria-chan.</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. I suddenly decided to join.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see. Ah, I&#8217;m Juria. Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m Tsugumi. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsugumi!? Tsugumi kinda looks like a fairy!”</p>
<p>Fairy… a fairy, huh? Certainly, my silver blonde and sapphire eye color scheme makes me look like a Nordic fairy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Mimi, greet her too!”</p>
<p>“I-I’m Mimi. It&#8217;s nice to meet chuu.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Rin. Nice to meet ya.”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Nice to meet you, Mimi-chan, Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>I managed to exchange greetings with all three of them. As expected, interacting with people is the basics of the basics. There might be an unforeseen connection after all. Above all, if you can&#8217;t mingle with even a single person at the filming site, you won’t be able to collaborate or empathize with them.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to open my mouth to chat a little longer, I was interrupted again. It seems like they’re ready.</p>
<p>“First off, we will have a simple dialogue test. We will hand you a script, so please read out loud the lines as you see fit.”</p>
<p>The scripts that were handed out were all the same. The scripts are the same so I guess they’re going to judge the difference in expression. However, the three of them just skimmed through it. They’ve probably memorized this, haven&#8217;t they? Well, I&#8217;ve heard that the scripts for child actor auditions are usually given two or three days in advance.</p>
<p>However, through my impression in this place today, it seems like the other children were not given this beforehand. Was this audition fixed? A fixed game? For some reason, I felt fired up, so I quickly looked over the script then closed it. In this life with my high-spec body, I had a good memory.</p>
<p>“Well then, let&#8217;s start with Asashiro Juria-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>The one in charge was the director. For some reason, I felt like the atmosphere seemed to be sharper than before.</p>
<p>Our partner was a woman prepared by the auditioner side. It seemed like she was a member of a theater company. The situation was simple: The daughter broke an ornament while her mother was away and she hid it. It seems like I’m the last one up, so I guess I&#8217;ll have to observe them first.</p>
<p>What Juria-chan was given was a broken piece of ornament. It looked like porcelain, but it seems like it was made of resin for safety reasons. It seemed that they wanted to see how she could improvise: How she could hide the broken ornament while acting.<br />
The dialogue was simple with more freedom in paraphrasing and scene setting, and was written as follows:</p>
︎
<p>Daughter: “Um, Mom.”</p>
<p>Mother: “What&#8217;s wrong? xxx (The child’s name.)”</p>
<p>Daughter: “&#8230;&#8230;” (You can stay silent, gloss it over, or insert some dialogue.)</p>
<p>Mother: &#8220;What is it? Dear, what are you hiding behind you?”</p>
<p>Daughter: “&#8230;It was very important, but I broke it.”</p>
<p>Mom: &#8220;Ah! Good grief, after I told you to be careful so many times. Don&#8217;t you have something to say?”</p>
<p>Daughter: “I&#8217;m sorry.”</p>
<p>Mom: “And then?”</p>
<p>Daughter: “&#8230; I won&#8217;t do it again.”</p>
<p>Mother: &#8220;Good.”</p>
<p>Or something like that. In the footnotes, it is stated that &#8220;you can rephrase matching to the image you are performing&#8221;, which means it’s okay to think of it as how the daughter, or rather, the person themselves, would perform when they’re guilty.</p>
<p>In other words, there are loose rules where as long as the person does not deviate completely from the script or give up in the middle of the performance, they are allowed to do whatever they want. Is there an actress whose spirit wouldn’t tremble? At least, currently, I am trying to stifle the crooked smile off my face.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m Minauchi Ran. I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! I’m Juria! I look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>Minauchi-san was a young woman, probably in her early twenties. Even though her partner was a child, she respected the other party. Most likely, she’s an honest individual.</p>
<p>Juria brought a bucket from the props that they said we were allowed to use however we wished. Thus, she used a bucket to completely hide the broken pieces of porcelain on the floor.</p>
<p>“Well, are you ready?”</p>
<p>The director said, then Juria-chan held the bucket with both hands and turned her back on Minauchi-san.</p>
<p>“Well then… lights, camera, action!”</p>
<p>The director&#8217;s yell was followed by the start of the performance. Well now, time to observe.</p>
<p>“Umm, err, Mom.”</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s wrong? Juria.”</p>
<p>“Well, I was cleaning and!”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Juria, what are you hiding behind you?”</p>
<p>An uneasy voice. Minauchi-san also changed her lines to match Juria&#8217;s performance. I guess I can expect her to be quite flexible.</p>
<p>“To-To tell you the truth, here!”</p>
<p>“Oh my!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry! It’s something important, right? I broke it…”</p>
<p>“Good grief, after I told you to be careful so many times. Don&#8217;t you have something to say?”</p>
<p>“Ughh… I won&#8217;t do it again.”</p>
<p>“Good. Don’t try to deceive me again, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so cute to see Juria in low spirits with her head down. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s like that at home too. It’s good to gloss it over, then properly apologize.</p>
<p>However, if you look at it from the dialogue point of view, she changed a lot of things&#8230; If you listened carefully to the performances of the groups nearby, they were all according to script no matter where you went. In fact, it even felt like they were testing Minauchi&#8217;s ability to handle the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut! That&#8217;s good, just as expected.”</p>
<p>“Ehehe.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll announce the results later, so let&#8217;s move on. Next&#8230; Mimi-chan.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes! I-I-I-I’ll do my best! Hwoo, haa.”</p>
<p>Mimi-chan clenched her fist and declared. I think she&#8217;s a person that always does her best. It&#8217;s just that she&#8217;s a little timid. Mimi-chan didn&#8217;t cover the broken pieces of porcelain with anything and just hid them behind her back. Both her hands were in front of her chest fidgeting, which was somewhat lovable.</p>
<p>When the director gave the same signal, Mimi-chan shut her eyes firmly and began her lines.</p>
<p>“U-Umm, Mom.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Mimi.”</p>
<p>“I-I, I knew it was something important to Mom, but I.”</p>
<p>“Mimi? &#8230;What are you hiding behind you?”</p>

<p>Mimi-chan averted her eyes as if scared of Minauchi-san’s gaze. Instead, she retreated a step back with her legs trembling.</p>
<p>“Oh my! &#8230;You broke it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Mhm. Sorry, I’m sorry, Mom!”</p>
<p>“Good grief. You aren’t hurt, right?”</p>
<p>“Nu uh… I won’t do it again, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Good. Be careful next time, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay…”</p>

<p>I wonder if her honest and proper apology included the feelings of guilt for hiding it. She must have a strict family. Subconsciously, I couldn’t help but think about Mimi&#8217;s real family.</p>
<p>That being said, Minauchi-san really is amazing. She probably doesn&#8217;t have any children yet, but she&#8217;s acting completely as a mother. I wonder if she’s also involved in this drama?</p>
<p>“Cut! Nice. You rephrased well and your expressions are quite good.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. &#8230;Phew.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Well then, next is Rin-chan, right? Are you ready to go?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Rin-chan frankly responded, then placed the broken pieces at her feet. Her style was to purposely not hide it, how fresh. However, if you properly think about it, when this sort of thing happens, a normal kid wouldn’t know what to do, wouldn’t they&#8230;</p>
<p>There was a broken piece of porcelain between Rin and Minauchi-san and they got into position. Minauchi-san was looking at it, pondering, but when the director took his place, her expression completely changed. Then, the curtains were raised again, in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>With an unconcerned, ‘tsun’ expression, Rin-chan turned her head away. <span id='easy-footnote-1-16815' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-16815' title='Cloud: Tsun as in tsundere.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>“Rin. What’s the matter with this?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s broken.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t broken before Mom went out, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ugh… I broke it.”</p>
<p>“Good grief. Don&#8217;t you have something to say to Mom?”</p>
<p>“I won’t do it again.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, but there’s one more thing. Out with it.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Good. You can’t lie again, all right?”</p>
<p>“Okayyy.”</p>
<p>This was very good. I thought she was the cool-type girl, but she&#8217;s pretty carefree. She probably has a cozy family. Her arrangement was well done and this one stuck to the script the most. There wasn’t much dialogue, so maybe they didn&#8217;t have to say much.</p>
<p>Given the situation, generally, she must have practiced this regularly at home? Her awareness is top-class. Well, it has nothing to do with me though. I just need to give it my best. <span id='easy-footnote-2-16815' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-16815' title='Cloud: Tsugumi’s basically saying that Rin has a lot of “real life” experience, aka she gets in trouble a lot.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>However, I’d be sorry to my parents, so I won’t go into my ghost mode.</p>
<p>Well now, let’s begin another fun play again today.</p>
<p>Topic: “The girl who broke something important.”</p>
<p>This is my self suggestion from long ago. I tap my chest with my index finger, then I fall into my role. <span id='easy-footnote-3-16815' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-16815' title='Cloud: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosuggestion&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosuggestion&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>I haven&#8217;t turned the switch on yet. That&#8217;s the director&#8217;s role after all.</p>

<p>“All right, that was good. You&#8217;re not so bad yourself, Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well then… the last one in this group. Are you good? Tsugumi-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I&#8217;m always ready!”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a good answer. Well then, take your positions.”</p>
<p>There&#8217;s enough of an audience.</p>
<p>The costar is ready.</p>
<p>Well, now then, let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<p>“Action!”</p>
<p>At the director&#8217;s shout—my consciousness switched with a click.</p>

Hiraga, the director, notices Tsumugi’s acting.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>In this program, the last turn belonged to that girl. She was the only one who was not given the script beforehand—in other words, it was time for her to improvise just about everything.</p>
<p>A normal kid would have either followed the script or ended up at their wits’ end. However, my instincts were sounding an alarm to me that it wouldn&#8217;t end like those common developments.</p>
<p>“(Well now, show me what you got, Sorahoshi Tsugumi.) —Action!”</p>
<p>The broken pieces of porcelain were in front of Minauchi-san and her. Compared to the distance Yoruhata Rin had, it was closer to her side. In regards to that, Tsugmi let her hair hang down and sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s wrong? Tsugumi.”</p>

<p>So far, all according to the script. However, Minauchi-san confusion was transmitted to me. Then, just as Minnauchi was about to open her mouth to tie everything together through ad libbing, Tsugumi looked up.</p>
<p>Her face drained of blood. White, tightly-knit lips. A trickle of tear fell from her large blue eyes, like a star’s twinkle.</p>

<p>“&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>Matching the timing she opened her mouth, Minauchi gulped without saying a word. It was as if she had been induced to act like that.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m… sorry. Even though Mom told me to be careful.”</p>

<p>I wonder if it was a treasure.<br />
It must have been something important.<br />
Tsugumi lifted the broken piece as if she were scooping up a small bird with broken wings.</p>
<p>“Even though it was something important…”</p>
<p>Her gaze dropped.</p>
<p>Her hand that held the treasure trembled.</p>
<p>The stream of tears wet the floor.</p>
<p>Feeble feet. / The slippers slipped off her hurried feet.</p>
<p>Her hands followed the broken fragment. / I wonder if the living room flooring was wooden.</p>
<p>Her heart in pain and her shoulders shivering. / A flickering light bulb. / Moonlight. / The night breeze. / Embrace her shoulder—</p>
<p>“Poor thing.”</p>
<p>I suddenly came to my senses when I heard the voice of the staff muttering next to me.</p>
<p>—No!</p>
<p>This is not the house where she lives. This is not a place to recall my memories.</p>
<p>A mesmerizing voice where if one kept listening, they’d be absorbed into her world.</p>
<p>The people around her all stopped whatever they were doing and were entranced by the girl wetting herself with pitiful tears. A voice that travels far, a tone that pierces your chest, lifelike acting that captures the atmosphere of this place into her world.</p>
<p>If this was a tear-jerker, the audience’s pillow would be soaked. If this was a story that bears anger, the audience would be trembling in anger. If this was a happy story, the audience would be cheering from the bottom of their hearts. If it was a horror story—they would be afraid just from imagining it.</p>
<p>(Doing this at the age of five—am I witnessing history in the making?)</p>
<p>What does Minauchi, on the other end, think about the “treasured child of that great actress” she’s facing? No, that would be if she was a third party, but she’s directly involved with her acting. There&#8217;s no time for her to think.</p>
<p>Minauchi first remained silent. If this were a stage where the roles were more fully developed, then this would be more like an improvised play. There was no choice but to keep acting.</p>
<p>“Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“Mom?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. It’s okay.”</p>
<p>“B-But. If it wasn’t for this…”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Minauchi hugged the trembling girl closely. It indicated that there was something more important than the broken object.</p>
<p>“Cut… Man was I surprised.”</p>
<p>That’s right, I lowered the curtains at the perfect timing. Rather than having her say the next line, it would have been more beautiful to draw the curtains closed here. That&#8217;s what my experience had told me.</p>
<p>And it must have been the same for Sorahoshi Tsugumi. She remained silent until the act was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsugumi-chan. Why did you decide to perform like that?”</p>
<p>I asked her as she bowed her head with a smile and thanked Minauchi. The other three felt guilty for destroying something that was “important to their mother”. However, she was the only one who acted as if she was in biting pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; it didn&#8217;t say ‘whose’ important thing it was in the script, so I performed thinking that it was my own important thing.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, you are not wrong.”</p>
<p>I see. Certainly, you can interpret it like that. And, even I could tell that she had the eyes to see through it.</p>
<p>If I think of her as a child and make light of her, it will be me who will be eaten alive. She was charming like an angel and her performance was that of a pure-hearted girl. That&#8217;s why, I must find out for sure in the next test.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Well then, you guys can take a break until the next test.”</p>
<p>After informing them, I issued directions to the staff that were still in a dreamy state of mind. There isn’t any time to take a break.</p>
<p>—Thinking back upon this scene, I never imagined that at that time I would be taught a lesson that her true worth could not be measured by a mere acting test.</p>

Tsugumi is surrounded by Juria, Mimi, and Rin.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>While the adults were preparing for the next test, I was surrounded by other children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsugumi, that was amazing. Where did you learn that?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Err, on my own, I guess. I was in the hospital due to an injury, so I had plenty of free time.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the girl who came up to me with the most glittering eyes was Yoruhata Rin-chan (written as ‘夜旗凛’), whom I had thought was a cool-type girl at initially. Rin-chan&#8217;s overall expression didn&#8217;t change much, but she talked to me with sparkling eyes, as if she was the type who spoke with her eyes.</p>
<p>Every time her deep jet-black hair swayed, I felt an uncomfortable feeling of, how do I put it, adorableness swelling up in me. What is this feeling? Love? No, that&#8217;s weird. I wonder if this is what those otakus call ‘moe’?</p>
<p>“I-I also won’t lose&#8230; I-I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>‘Funsu’, Mimi-chan fired herself up. Her name is written as ‘夕顔美海’. I checked her name tag. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18012' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18012' title='Cloud: I’ve linked a NicoDouga video that basically shows what ‘funsu’ is. Yui (from K-ON) doing cute things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm14053346&quot;&gt;https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm14053346&lt;/a&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>Surprisingly, she too was not scared or perplexed but was full of fighting spirit towards me. I thought her brown hair contributed to her plain impression, but when she showed her confidence like this, her bright hair color made her stand out.</p>
<p>“What’s with that? Hmph, this is just the beginning!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahaha, I guess so.”</p>
<p>“—‘funsu’!”</p>
<p>And finally, the most unexpected was the girl who seemed bright and amiable, Asashiro Juria-chan. Juria-chan turned her head away with a ‘hmph’ and crossed her arms while her bright red hair shook. That&#8217;s just right for a rival rising to the top.</p>
<p>But, what is it? On the one hand, my actress soul feels that way, but on the other hand, I also felt sighing at the fact that my previous life aged-self was teasing a young girl, which felt both childish and embarrassing. My feelings became complex, so I&#8217;ll let Rin heal me.</p>
<p>“Everyone, it&#8217;s about time to move on to the next test. This time, we’ve prepared a set that matches each group&#8217;s personality, so could we move to the neighboring room?”</p>
<p>They prepared a set? They’re going that far for a mere audition? Kirio Tsugumi debuted in her teens, so maybe I just don&#8217;t know much about the world of child acting.</p>
<p>But, when my gaze shifted just a little bit, I had a slightly uncomfortable feeling. The staff dripping with sweat, the staff hurriedly sending out instructions somewhere, Juria-chan’s mother’s extremely puzzled expression, my parent’s friendly smile—that’s normal, huh?</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, perhaps my fears were correct, but Juria&#8217;s mother quickly approached a young staff member and whispered something. Normally, one wouldn&#8217;t have been able to hear her, but that was that. If you were a horror actress, you wouldn’t fail to hear the breath of an actor.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s going on? I thought this was going to be over with a simple test?”</p>
<p>&#8220;S-Sorry, but Director Hiraga decided on the contents of the second test…”</p>
<p>“Like I asked, wasn&#8217;t that supposed to be a simple test!?”</p>
<p>“Eek, I&#8217;m sorry. At any rate, there was a change in personnel, so…”</p>
<p>“That’s right, who’s that kid to begin with!? Both her parents are smiling, but it&#8217;s strangely scary…”</p>
<p>“I-It was the sponsor’s idea… I don’t know any more than that.”</p>
<p>“Sponsor? Was Sorahoshi a sponsor?”</p>
<p>&#8230;Hmm, I guess it was a fixed audition to an extent, and now that there&#8217;s one more person, there&#8217;s more to do, I guess? I might have done something a bit bad. However, at least it didn&#8217;t seem like there was going to be a vacancy spot in this group.</p>
<p>Also, when you say &#8220;sponsor”, it feels like, well, you&#8217;re rich so you should at least be the one sponsoring. I never thought that the day would come when I would become one of those &#8220;sponsored actors&#8221; that I was so tired of in my previous life. I&#8217;ll have to get a role with my own abilities soon.</p>
<p>By the way, my name is legally ‘Tsugumi Sorahoshi Lowell’, but to make it easier for me to live in Japan, I called myself by my mother’s family name that was used as my middle name, so the sponsor might be listed by my father’s family name “Lowell”.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grrr, watch me, Mom! I&#8217;m definitely not going to lose!”</p>
<p>“Concentrate, concentrate, write the character ‘人’, eat.” <span id='easy-footnote-2-18012' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18012' title='Cloud: If you haven’t seen in manga/anime, it’s a Japanese thing to write the character for ‘person’ (人) on your and pretend to eat it in order to get rid of your nervousness.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“&#8230;I wonder what’s for dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>Three different people, three different personalities. While looking at the three people with different individual personalities, we moved to the neighboring room. The neighboring room… or at least it should have been, but after going past a few doors, got on an elevator, and then taken somewhere called the ‘neighboring room’. Perhaps, they used the term out of consideration for the other audition participants.</p>
<p>We were taken to a studio—a place with a decent number of sets, cameras, sounds, and microphones—which was placed side by side with the monitor room. Wait. no, no no, this has exceeded a mere dry rehearsal (a rehearsal without a camera), this is a real set, right?</p>
<p>Are they trying to let the participants feel like actors? No, no, no, isn&#8217;t the producer the one sitting on the monitor side? Let&#8217;s not think too deeply about it anymore.</p>
<p>“This time, we will be carrying a type of drama where the script is written after the main cast is decided. Therefore, the four of you will perform an impromptu play in front of the camera, which will be used as a reference for deciding your positions if you are accepted.”</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that like saying that you&#8217;ve already passed? Well, but, it’s fine as long as they transmit that to the parents. It’ll be good if the children would think, “If I pass here, I’ll make it as part of the main cast!”</p>
<p>The set looked like a school classroom. A blackboard, cleaning tools, desks, chairs, a podium. Since we’re five, six years old, we’ll probably be playing the role of an elementary school student.</p>
<p>“I want the four of you to discuss and perform two impromptu plays here.”</p>
<p>The one who began to speak was the director… that’s right, the person Juria-chan’s mother called, “Director Hiraga”.</p>
<p>“The first theme is ‘Transfer Student and Kind Classmates’. The second theme is&#8230; I&#8217;ll announce it when we’re finished with the first one, so I want you to work hard on the first one first.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Thus, the four of us got together and decided on the contents. Since it was an impromptu play, it would be better to just decide on our course of action and perform freely. If we were adults, on the other hand, it might have been better to determine the lines to a certain extent.</p>
<p>When the four of us met face-to-face, Juria raised her hand before anyone else. Oh, you&#8217;re the leader type, aren&#8217;t you? As for me, I only want to compete with you and I don&#8217;t want to kick you down or anything. If you want to be the facilitator, that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>“I want to be the kind classmate!”</p>
<p>&#8220;M-Me too.”</p>
<p>Ahh, I see, I see. Mimi-chan is also shrewdly boarding the ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll be the ‘transfer student’. Rin-chan, are you fine with being the kind classmate?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>A story about three people, who were good friends to begin with, warmly welcoming a foreign transfer student seems pretty real. I mean, my color scheme is completely like a foreigner’s.</p>
<p>However, that would be boring if we just did that. All right, let’s add a twist.</p>
<p>“Then, I&#8217;ll play the role of someone who doesn&#8217;t understand Japanese.”</p>
<p>&#8220;? That way, we won’t be able to communicate, you know?”</p>
<p>“It’ll be fine!”</p>
<p>“? Ah, T-Tsugumi-chan, wouldn’t it be better for your name to be in English then?”</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s see. Hmm, Rin-chan, what do you think would be good?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t something like ‘Alice’ fine?”</p>
<p>What Juria-chan said was reasonable. I wouldn’t have any lines or anything. However, speaking is not the only way to express yourself. Do evil spirits talk? No. Evil spirits are more frightening because they cannot communicate. Therefore, horror actors are more concerned about expressing themselves through non-verbal means than other actors.</p>
<p>We talked about the plan. In other words, being kind to a foreigner who doesn&#8217;t understand your language. Also, if possible, have a teacher-role to introduce me to everyone as a beginning. Ah, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, should we ask whether there’s a teacher?”</p>
<p>“Ah, okay, leave it to me!”</p>
<p>“J-Juria-chan, geez.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>I walked around the compact set and soon found the person I was looking for. Rather, Director Hiraga was with them, so they were easy to find.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Ahh, have you guys finished preparing already?”</p>
<p>Director Hiraga asked me with a smile as I entered his view.</p>
<p>“We are, but that’s not it.”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>“I would like Minauchi-san to play the ‘teacher’ role.”</p>
<p>When I asked, the person next to Director Hiraga—Minauchi Ran-san—blinked her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Director, should I?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it fine? However, just this time, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand!”</p>
<p>When I turned to Minauchi-san, she smiled softly at me. The hair that was put up during the previous test was now let down. When she did that, combined with her soft expression, she looked much younger than I imagined.</p>
<p>Also, that’s right, I felt she looked somehow like someone I knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll be in your care, Tsugumi-chan.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup! Thank you very much!”</p>
<p>I led Minauchi-san by her hand and went back to the others. Everyone welcomed Minauchi-san with a smile.</p>
<p>Then, as if arranged beforehand, the director gave us a signal, so we all went on the classroom set. It seemed that the corridor had not been built, so we lined up next to the podium, and started. Also, while we were at it, let&#8217;s set up the situation.</p>

<p>A distant foreign country.</p>
<p>Language that I could not understand.</p>
<p>Anxiety and hope mixed together.</p>
<p>However, the first step I took was a fickle.</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s start. Lights, camera, action!”</p>
<p>Click, my gears started to mesh.</p>

<p>“Well then, this is Alice-chan who’ll be your friend starting today. She doesn&#8217;t seem to understand Japanese yet, but everyone, please be good friends with her.”</p>
<p>“Yoroshiku, onegaishimasu.” <span id='easy-footnote-3-18012' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18012' title='Cloud: Tsugumi’s supposed to be a foreigner, who doesn’t understand Japanese, thus these are words that she’s ‘memorized’ instead of actually understanding what they mean. They are in katakana in the raws as well, thus, I decided to put it in romanji.&lt;br /&gt;
Slothmaster (Arocks): For those who are wondering what it means: It’s a form of first greeting, which can be said to mean “Please treat me well”.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>

<p>—When I bowed my head, a bewildered look pierced at me. Will we be able to get along? I wonder if they will hate me. In my hometown, I was able to make friends right away. However, how about in this distant foreign country? My wavering gaze sank from anxiety and I ended up looking at my toes.</p>
<p>It’s hopeless. If I don&#8217;t look up soon, the teacher will be bothered. So, I looked at the teacher, but she only smiled at me. I think I got the Japanese right. Did I make a mistake? What if I made a mistake? The more time passed, the more fearful I became.</p>

<p>“I’m Juria! Alice is fine, right?”</p>

<p>I nodded. However, using these strange words again was scary and my voice wouldn’t come out. However, Juria-chan grabbed my hand and lifted it up, giving me nowhere to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sensei, it’s okay if she sits next to me, right!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. Alice-chan, that’s fine, right?”</p>

<p>I nodded my head in a daze and Juria-chan dragged me along with her. As soon as I did, a girl—with hair like the night—sitting in front of my seat secretly began talking to me.</p>

<p>“Juria is a bit forceful. If there’s a problem, just tell me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Rin, did you say something?”</p>
<p>“Nothing really.”</p>

<p>As I frantically shook my head, Rin-chan gave me a smile as calm and serene as the winter sea. My hometown was a very cold place. She was as quiet as the cold sea, but she had a very warm smile.</p>
<p>I took my seat, and my day started as if it was trifling. Come to think of it, I don&#8217;t have my textbook yet. I searched inside my desk even though there’s no way there’d be anything, then my gaze loitered left and right and noticed that I didn&#8217;t have any words to say.</p>
<p>I wondered what I had been doing until now. The disordered words wouldn’t come out from my chest and I clutched the edge of the skirt that Mama had picked out for me, trying to gloss over my trembling eyelids—suddenly, I felt heat right next to me.</p>

<p>“I-I’m Mimi. Want to look together?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>When the girl gently pulled her desk over to mine, my eyelids stopped trembling.</p>
<p>“—Cut!”</p>
<p>Click, the cogs disconnected. The lingering memory of the role returned to my heart and the girl named Alice fell asleep. The one that woke up was the usual me. The actress named Kirio Tsugumi died in the middle of my dream and is currently living her next life as the half-Japanese girl named Sorahoshi Tsugumi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah—as I thought, acting is fun.”</p>
<p>The leaked voice did not resonate in the set. The only response was a dull silence.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene 6</strong></p>

<p>Audition Venue (Day)<br />
Tsugumi calls out to the absent-minded Mimi.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>After finishing the first performance, I called out to Mimi who was beside me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work. Thanks, Mimi-chan.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Tha—ah, hm, y-yeah. I-I’m all right. Good work, Tsugumi-chan.&#8221;</p>
<p>My words were the signal for everyone to come out from this atmosphere. Uh-huh, I was probably a misfortunate, good little girl. It would not feel out of place if she died in an unforeseen accident and appeared as a ghost after this… Wait, this is different.</p>
<p>“ Huh? I&#8217;m in the classroom… This isn’t it, I&#8217;m in the middle of an audition. Huh?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’m dreaming. I’m going back to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Y-You can’t go to sleep, Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>The time it takes to get out of a role is quite different among actors. Some cannot get out of the role while the camera is on. Some actors live as their character&#8217;s personalities during the scene. Some actors, like me, get out at the end of a scene with a signal. Some just get out naturally.</p>
<p>I guess everyone was gradually getting out of their role by now. The rustling sound of footsteps filled the area around me. I waved to my father and mother and they waved back with a smile. Huh? Are you two crying? Huh?</p>
<p>&#8220;—I&#8217;d like to sleep with this lingering feeling, but there&#8217;s one more thing I need to figure out. I&#8217;m going to tell you the subject of the next test, so I want you to listen carefully.</p>
<p>Director Hiraga&#8217;s words brought everyone together. The director looked at the monitor room then surveyed us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in the same classroom next time. However, this time I want you to divide it into two.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to do it twice?”</p>
<p>“Haha, no, that&#8217;s not what I mean, Tsugumi-chan. It&#8217;s simple. Good and evil. I want you to split into good children and bad children and perform as four. I’ll leave it to you all to decide on the direction. However, if there is something you really don’t understand, I want you to ask me.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>I see. Well, I guess this is acceptable if you wanted to see the extent of our acting. As I thought so and looked at the three, they all had stiff expressions on their faces. I wondered if something happened. They had been so carefree just now.</p>
<p>Ah, could it be that they don’t want to play the bad child role? That&#8217;s—no, let&#8217;s think about it. I&#8217;m starting to enjoy this.</p>
<p>“Then, the four of you can discuss it.”</p>
<p>Once again, we met face-to-face. This time, however, no one said a word. As we were pondering what to do, suddenly, Julia-chan muttered something.</p>
<p>“—child.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be the bad child!”</p>
<p>That was unexpected. I thought she was the girl who did not mind going out in front of others.</p>
<p>“B-But, Julia-chan, someone has to do it.”</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Julia performed the role you wanted to play just now.”</p>
<p>“Then, Rin should do it! I-I, I actually—”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18015" src="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00031-210x300.jpeg" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00031-210x300.jpeg 210w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00031-717x1024.jpeg 717w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00031-768x1097.jpeg 768w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00031.jpeg 898w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 85vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm. Fine, I&#8217;ll do it then.”</p>
<p>Rin-chan said, but there was a bit of hesitation in her expression. Additionally, Mimi-chan extended her hand out, calling out to her nervously, however, there was no power behind her voice and it faded out.</p>
<p>For just a moment, Julia-chan looked like she was regretting it… but in the end, she bit her lips and turned away. I wonder if there were some circumstances. Uh-huh, in that case, Onee-san (my body age was younger though) here should pitch in and help as expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Rin-chan, you wanna be the bad children together?”</p>
<p>“Eh—you sure? Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>Rin-chan was very surprised for a moment, then after, she timidly agreed. Of course, this was going to be the case. I was even thinking of doing this from the beginning. However, since I have the opportunity, let’s make use of this situation.</p>
<p>“Of course! In return, can I decide on the contents of the play?”</p>
<p>“Sure! Mimi and I are the good children, okay? Leave it to us!”</p>
<p>“G-Geez, Julia-chan.”</p>
<p>“You suddenly became full of spirit. Julia sure is a calculating person.”</p>
<p>With my proposal, what seemed to be a tense situation dispersed. Needless to say, it goes without saying that it succeeded since the three of them were good friends in the first place.</p>
<p>I only informed the three of the direction of the play. If you could not elaborately prepare for your part of a play, then you should freely act following the flow of the play after all.</p>
<p>“First, I&#8217;m going to bully Mimi-chan.”</p>
<p>“Eh! Ah, s-sure, I’ll do my best to be… bullied?”</p>
<p>“Then, Rin-chan, do you wanna be me, the bully?”</p>
<p>“I am a member of the bad children crew. Leave it to me.”</p>
<p>“Then, it should be fine if I enter the scene and save her!”</p>
<p>Everyone understood my simple explanation without any issues. Even Julia-chan seemed to be more energetic than usual.</p>
<p>Then, here comes the real part.</p>
<p>“Yup. Then, Mimi-chan, no matter what I say, you should express your dislike like saying, “No!” or, “I don’t wanna!” and stuff like that.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah? Got it.”</p>
<p>“Rin-chan actually does not actually want to be with me, but instead wants to play with Julia-chan and the rest, however, you don’t want to leave me alone so you stick with me since it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Julia-chan hates being the bad child, but you like Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>“? Okay! Rin and I have always been good friends.”</p>
<p>All right, now we’ve decided on the foundation. What should I do with Mimi-chan? It’s not like I could hit her, and it would be a problem if she caught a cold after I splashed water on her… I had a talk with her and we decided I would push her. I would push her with both hands, then she would fall onto the ground.</p>
<p>When I suggested this to Mimi, she nodded enthusiastically. She was overenthusiastic, so I better make sure that she doesn’t hurt her bottom.</p>
<p>“—Oh, are you done?”</p>
<p>When I looked towards the director, he tilted his head with a smile. I don’t know if it&#8217;s the effect of his passion or something else, but I feel like I&#8217;m getting more childish every time I talk to him.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. All right, everyone, let&#8217;s get ready! Let’s do this!”</p>
<p>Evil, evil, evil, huh? I wonder what kind of reason this girl has for becoming evil. A reason out of her control? I guess so. Some kids are probably like that. Parental education? The most likely reason. However, in any event, the cause that “frightens” me the most more than anything would be:</p>
<p>Irrationality.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Near the Audition Venue (Day)<br />
Hiraga calls out to the broadcasting station’s bigwig.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Kuramoto Kouji, a producer who worked his way up Hinomoto Television.</p>
<p>Akasaka Mitsunori, the mainstay script, broadcast, and composition writer who has been continuously supporting Hinomoto Television.</p>
<p>In addition, there&#8217;s Minauchi Ran, the niece of ‘that famous actress’ and her cherished child.</p>
<p>While Minauchi is still relatively unknown, the other two were big-shots of the big-shots. The TV station invested quite some money to arrange for these pure-bred, child actresses.</p>
<p>There was an unexpected arrival and she brought out results beyond imagination. The staff was in a fluster and contacted their superiors. Producer Kuramoto and Akasaka-sensei learned of this and responded, “I see, how interesting,” then came to me with footwork that did not reflect their age.</p>
<p>As for me, if I could get these two to watch the audition, it would make it easier for me as the director of this drama in the future. The reason that people were hailing Hiraga Daisuke, the promising new face, was just curiosity that stemmed from his work that just happened to be a hit. I want to steal everything I can from the bigwigs while they&#8217;re still giving me a budget.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kuramoto-san, their acting just now was quite good, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, it was, wasn’t it, Akasaka-sensei. This reminds me of “that”.”</p>
<p>“If Kuramoto-san is mentioning it, it&#8217;s that person, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, you’re right. Minauchi-kun, you know what I mean, don&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>“Umm—do you mean my aunt, Kiritani Ouka?”</p>
<p>“Ouka-kun, huh? No, she was also magnificent. However, there was another person.”</p>
<p>Producer Kuramoto always wore thick sunglasses, so I could not read his expression. However, Akasaka-sensei next to me was scrutinizing her wrinkled eyes a little, looking somewhat nostalgic.</p>
<p>Producer Kuramoto laughed at Minauchi, who had her head tilted. It was his characteristic attractive voice. That voice of his, this time, was directed at me in a merry tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;—Hey, Director Hiraga&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of performance do you think people give when they have to play a role that they don’t like or a role that makes them hated?”</p>
<p>Kuramoto asked me in a somewhat expectant voice.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be an unwilling, crude performance?”</p>
<p>“There’s also that. But you see, they aren’t serious and they don’t put their soul into it. Right? Akasaka-sensei.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right, that is a thing. Villains always leave a bad impression after they are aired.”</p>
<p>When they talked about this topic, I suddenly remembered what had just happened. When I heard them talking from a distance, I heard someone did not want to be the villain. It seems that the aforementioned child had been nominated to take the role, but I wonder if she was really okay with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let her play a role they don’t like. Oddly enough, this was exactly what I had in mind. Will they deal with this begrudgingly or will they take it seriously? This was the test I proposed to see if they would take this seriously and not underestimate the audition just because they were children.</p>
<p>“But you see, Director Hiraga. The person I knew when she was still unknown would appoint herself to the role that people hated the most.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahh, I remember that too, Kuramoto-san! If I remember correctly, that’s right—”</p>
<p>““It would be such a shame not to perform such an interesting role!””</p>
<p>The voices of Producer Kuramoto and Akasaka-sensei overlapped.</p>
<p>What’s with that? A role that makes you hated is the role of a villain or a hated person. How gutsy did they have to be to boldly declare that when they were a nameless actor? How much were they in love with their life as an actor?</p>
<p>The inside of my heart tingled. It was as if my soul was trembling, wanting to work side by side with such a person, such an actor.</p>
<p>“From her point of view, we were also rookies too, weren’t we?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, Sensei. I was still an assistant director at a production company back then. Even Sensei was sort of a “Sensei” apprentice at the time, weren’t you?” <span id='easy-footnote-1-18014' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18014' title='Flowingcloud: If you’re not a weeb, the title “Sensei” does not only refer to teachers but many other occupations, including authors/writers. Akasaka-sensei, the bigshot scriptwriter is also a “Sensei”. What Producer Kuramoto meant was that Akasaka was probably under another scriptwriter at the time or a position something similar.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>“Ahahaha. That brings back memories. But, I never thought they would leave us so soon.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Um, you don’t mean…”</p>
<p>Minauchi’s eyes opened wide as she reacted to their words. They were a person who died early, who took the initiative to play roles people hated, who was mourned for more than anyone else, not to mention they were probably enjoying their life even after death.</p>
<p>Just remembering is terrifying. The first time my father took me to the movie theater to see a movie with “her” in it, the two of us spent the night without sleeping a wink in horror.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, they have the same name, Kuramoto-san.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. The situation is also very similar. Maybe they&#8217;ve come back, Akasaka-sensei.”</p>
<p>“Please stop. My wife is already getting old. It must be hard to be treated as a body pillow.”</p>
<p>“Uh-oh, I have the chills too now. I&#8217;ll have my daughter comfort me. She&#8217;ll be furious though.”</p>
<p>Just as I was about to say their name, I was called for. The discussion seemed like it was about to end. I better be on standby. The staff made the right move.</p>
<p>“Well then, I will be over there.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. We&#8217;ll be watching from here with Minauchi-kun.”</p>
<p>“There are two nursing patients here after all.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Both of you are still young, geez.”</p>
<p>Minauchi left and walked towards the children.</p>
<p>Looking back, her acting at first was amazing. Her gaze, expression, movements, and gestures. It was as if she was controlling everything then and there.</p>
<p>Now, she&#8217;s going to play a villain? That child gave a pitiful performance as if she was an angel. As expected, it would be tough. On the other hand, the words of the mainstays lurked in my mind.</p>

<p>“It would be such a shame not to perform such an interesting role!”</p>

<p>Is this an interesting role for her to play? Or could it be?</p>
<p>I picked up her gaze searching for me. I wondered what kind of &#8220;evil&#8221; would be portrayed in her clear, watery eyes. When I thought about it, I seemed to have snapped out of it from excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;—Oh, are you done?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Well then, everyone, let&#8217;s get ready! Let&#8217;s do this!”</p>
<p>They got into position. It seemed that Asashiro Julia would be entering in the middle. There was no hallway because we had brought an unfinished set in a hurry. They were informed that they would have to jump in from behind the set when she caught onto their voices.</p>
<p>In the same way after school cleaning, the chairs were raised onto the desks, making the floor of the classroom appear wider. Sorahoshi Tsugumi and Yoruhata Rin stood side by side, with Yuugao Mimi standing in front of them. They were just checking their lines and direction and were ready to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, show me what you can do. Lights, camera—”</p>
<p>I held my breath.</p>
<p>I could hear my heartbeat.</p>
<p>The camera was rolling, the microphone was set up, and the lighting faintly flickered.</p>
<p>“Action!!”</p>
<p>The seal was released the same time I shouted. What kind of performance will she give us? The first one to move in front of us was Tsugumi. She had a bright, lovely smile on her face like a fairy.</p>
<p>“I knew it. There&#8217;s no way a good girl like her could be a villain.”</p>
<p>A young staff member muttered in a soft voice. I nodded my head in agreement with her opinion. However, my evaluation would be realized by the kind of performance she would give from now on. After all, Rin is also a villain. She may be the one taking the lead.</p>

<p>“Hey, could you give me this brooch?”</p>

<p>Sweet coaxing, however, I felt a little sense of discomfort. The air, the atmosphere, it was as if it changed.</p>

<p>“N-No.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s something important, so I can’t give it to you, Tsugumi-chan.”</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. If you want someone else&#8217;s precious thing, why are you smiling so innocently?　What are we being shown?</p>
<p>While the audience was puzzled, the gears turned. As if a switch was suddenly flipped—Sorahoshi Tsugumi’s expression caved in.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. I said I wanted it, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? —Kyaah!”</p>
<p>The moment Tsugumi said so, she pushed Mimi down. Spontaneously, Tsugumi put both her hands on Mimi’s cheeks, while Mimi herself had fallen down, then her lips approached close to Mimi’s ears, as if whispering, as if warning her.</p>

<p>“Listen up. You’re an insect. You’re just an insane that gets crushed. If you do what you’re told, I’m telling you I’ll give you some sweet nectar, but why don’t you like it? All of you, everything, how about giving me all of you? —If you say, “Yes,” I won’t crush you.”</p>
<p>“Eek!”</p>

<p>—Ahh, Yuugao Mimi is really an insect to her, not a girl. Cold-hearted eyes and a completely chilled voice. The fingers that stabbed on her cheek might be trying to bite a hole through Mimi. Even so, she made me think.</p>
<p>Well then, how is the other villain doing? If you look at her, Yoruhata Rin is desperately averting her eyes. She doesn&#8217;t help her frightened classmate who was in pain. I see, that is, another evil.</p>

<p>“Mimi!? Tsugumi, what are you going to Mimi!? She doesn’t like it, don’t you see!?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Eradicating the insects. Do you want to join, Julia-chan?”</p>
<p>“No way! Let go of Mimi!”</p>

<p>Julia forced her way through between Mimi and Tsugumi. Then, she looked at Rin in a complicated way, afterward, looked at Tsugumi with indignation in her eyes. She didn’t like Tsugumi, but not so much for Rin?</p>

<p>“Phew. Hey, Mimi-chan.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>

<p>Tsugumi called Mimi by her name for the first time now. There was a smile on her face. However, the pupils in her eyes that were chilly and frozen still noticed her surroundings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18016" src="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00033-210x300.jpeg" alt="" width="210" height="300" srcset="https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00033-210x300.jpeg 210w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00033-716x1024.jpeg 716w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00033-768x1098.jpeg 768w, https://yado-inn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/00033.jpeg 924w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 85vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>“Hit Julia-chan. If you do so, I’ll make Julia-chan the insect. You will be my friend. You don’t want to be crushed, right?”</p>

<p>How…</p>
<p>How innocent and cruel. She’s telling her that if you sell out your friend, she’ll help you and stop bullying you.</p>

<p>“Hey? Mimi-chan—”</p>
<p>“(I need to see that I don’t want to) …No!!”</p>
<p>“—Hmm. I see, you’re fine with being an insect.”</p>

<p>In response to Mimi&#8217;s refusal, her expression caved in again. Her eyes were cold. In her mind, even Asashiro Julia was already an “insect” a long time ago.</p>

<p>“No matter what you say, I will protect Mimi!”</p>
<p>“Do as you like. This is boring now. —Let’s go, Rin-chan.”</p>
<p>“Ah— …yeah.”</p>

<p>Julia and Mimi turned their backs on them. Tsugumi turned her back on them as well. Rin tried to say something to Julia and Mimi, but she shook her head, bit her lower lip, and turned her back on Julia and the rest. The bully&#8217;s partner. The only person that she (Tsugumi) trusts, thus she responds with deep affection.</p>
<p>However, from her expression and behavior, her heart cried that she really wanted to be friends with Julia and the others, and it resonated into the void.</p>
<p>“This is an… acting test? After, this is…”</p>
<p>The clammer made me come back to my senses. Ahh, I understand what the staff is trying to say. After all, this—this sort of performance, was not within the frame of an acting test.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s too dramatic.”</p>
<p>My hands that called for the cut trembled. I never knew that there would be a scene that I did not want to end. Ahh, even so, I could not shake off the excitement at the thought that from today, the history of television will be rewritten.</p>
<p>“—Cutttttt!! …I believe it is my good fortune that I was present here today.”</p>
<p>I mumbled to myself, forgetting that this was an audition to select for a role. But of course, no one pointed that out.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Scene: Final</strong></p>

<p>Within the Car (Evening)<br />
Tsugumi and her parents chat.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>—In the car at dusk. A crimson red shone on the limousine sofa. I wondered if a child&#8217;s body has a limit to how long it can be active, or if I was just tired after not having acted for so long. As I was rubbing my eyelids and dozing off, I naturally found my way to my mother&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>My father was next to me, patting my head softly. For me (Kirio Tsugumi), who had never experienced the existence of kind parents, my parents (Sorahoshi Tsugumi) were too perfect and strange. Nevertheless, as I surrendered myself into their comfort, I was covered in an inexplicable and abashed feeling, as if my thirsting heart was being moistened.</p>
<p>“You did well, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“It seems like you&#8217;ve made a lot of friends. My angel, can you tell Daddy and Mommy about your friends tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… okay, I got it, Daddy, Mommy.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to tell Mama about your friends? Hehe, I&#8217;m so happy.”</p>
<p>Friends… that’s right, friends. After the performance, we somehow exchanged our contact information. When I said I did not have an address book yet, my parents seemed to have written them down for me. They are also going to buy me a cell phone another time it seems like. They said something about Lane(?), but I wonder if that is what they call email nowadays. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18018' title='Flowingcloud: Address book. ADDRESS BOOK! Damn, I forgot this was even a thing back in the days. My mom used to have one, but nowadays it’s just your contacts list. Also, if you couldn’t tell, “Lane” is just a parody of Line.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>If I shut my eyelids, I could immediately remember the girls. How should I put it, they seemed to be full of personality and overflowing in talent, just like the people Kirio Tsugumi had been involved with.</p>
<p>Bright red hair and lively eyes, Asashiro Juria.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re my rival from today on!”</p>
<p>When I recalled ‘her’ declaring so, I felt somewhat nostalgic.</p>
<p>My rivals in those days must be unreachable big names now.</p>
<p>Quiet girl with chestnut hair and glasses, Yuugao Mimi.</p>
<p>“I-I&#8217;m not going to lose too!”</p>
<p>She was surprisingly aggressive, but she said this with a cute, enthusiastic tone.</p>
<p>She was like a small animal and adorable, but my intuition tells me that she would probably turn out to be like a large animal surely. She must be a carnivore.</p>
<p>Then, jet black hair and a cool look, Yoruhata Rin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I go visit you next time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Really? Then, come visit me too. I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>She was the one who was the most different from my first impression. Rin-chan told me this with a gleam in her eye and an expression that didn&#8217;t change much. Also, as soon as she found out that I did not have a cell phone, she immediately gave me her home phone number.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it seems to be a given that everyone has a cell phone… I wonder if there is anything interesting about having a cell phone as a child? Well, I am about to get one myself, as I am targeted by violent perverts because of my appearance, and maybe celebrities all have one.</p>
<p>“When you get one, let’s play ‘GureBure’. Add me as your ‘friend’.” <span id='easy-footnote-2-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18018' title='Flowingcloud: This abbreviation will be further explained in the next chapter’s footnotes.'><sup>2</sup></a></span>
<p>“? Rin-chan and I are already friends, right?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah… Tsugumi, you’re fine like this.” <span id='easy-footnote-3-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18018' title='Flowingcloud: LMAO, this is like when you find out a Japanese translator ISN’T a weeb.

<p>There’s this… like… generation gap. Rather, I feel like I&#8217;m going to get swept up by something I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>“Heh heh.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you&#8217;re laughing? Did you remember something?”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, it’s a secret.”</p>
<p>“Ara ara, how precocious, aren’t you?” <span id='easy-footnote-4-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18018' title='Flowingcloud: Ara ara.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>I want to achieve what I could not accomplish in my previous life. I know from my own experience that I can&#8217;t stop thinking that way until I’ve gotten to the end. However, from that same experience, I decided to be properly filial to my parents, enjoy myself to the fullest, and live life to the best of my ability this time.</p>
<p>I’m not going to stop midway. I&#8217;m sure that this is a wish and a longing that has now firmly taken shape.</p>
<p>(But, for now&#8230;)</p>
<p>First… I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to resist my drowsiness any… longer…</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Tsugumi.&#8221;</p>
<p>—Good night, Daddy, Mommy.</p>

Asashiro Family (Evening)<br />
(Lights)<br />
Juria’s mother, Satsuki, furrows her brows and chews her lips.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>“It would be such a shame not to perform such an interesting role!”</p>
<p>What’s with that? I don’t want to. Why the villain, why?</p>
<p>“You don’t have to force yourself to not be afraid of it, you know?”</p>
<p>I know, just because I&#8217;m just a kid, you’re not taking me seriously. I&#8217;m going to tell the office that I’m not scary, because you aren’t scary.</p>
<p>“Yup! It was a good performance. Keep up the good work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmph. “Keep up the good work” your ass, you’re just spouting what you like.</p>
<p>“The reason you’re lined up with Tsugumi-san is because of Tsugumi-san.”</p>
<p>I-I know that—better than anyone else!!</p>

<p>“Mom?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Juria. I&#8217;m sorry, I must have fallen asleep.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Are you tired?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. I&#8217;m just impressed that you managed to avoid being the villain. Good job.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah.”</p>
<p>My daughter, Juria, followed me as if she were clinging to me. I’m sure she’s anxious right now. However, I&#8217;m sure she will soon understand what I mean. That lass’s performance was indeed brilliant. But for that reason, the director will probably have her play the villain.</p>
<p>Okay, it worked out this time. But, what about the next stage? What about the next one after that? A child who becomes successful as a villain will have the image of a villain attached to them. One day, they will get tired of playing the villain and fall into desperation.</p>
<p>Just like what happened to me.</p>
<p>“Mom, what are you doing tomorrow? Is it a day off? My birthday is—”</p>
<p>“Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll be filming from the morning. You can order online and eat whatever you want. And… Did you say something?”</p>
<p>“—No. It’s nothing. Got it.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>I will definitely, definitely, DEFINITELY, going to make Juria happy. I will raise her to be the most successful and popular actress of all time. I won’t let anyone tell me that I can&#8217;t do this as a single mother.</p>
<p>There is nothing that will make her happier than becoming an actress that everyone loves.</p>
<p>Therefore, I won’t be chasing your shadow anymore—Kirio Tsugumi!</p>

<p>“Mom won’t be happy if I’m the bad kid. I have to be the best good kid. More than anyone else.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure Mom will surely look at me then… won’t she?”</p>

Yuugao Family (Evening)<br />
(Lights)<br />
Mimi’s mother, Natsu, relaxing in the living room.<br />
Natsu is confused at her daughter’s current state being displayed.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>“Mom! Dad! I have something I want to say!”</p>
<p>We looked at each other as Mimi raised her voice louder than we had ever heard before. Our daughter had always been shy, quiet, and bad at speaking. We would not have let her be a child actress unless she wanted to. She had grown up and come back to us after the audition where we had entrusted her to Asashiro-san.</p>
<p>I am called the queen of daytime dramas, but in short, I am just an actress who specializes in “that kind of acting”. People say I have a glamorous personal life, but all I do is relax on the top floor of my condominium with my photographer husband. I think we were just an ordinary family.</p>
<p>“Whoa, what happened, Mimi? Natsu, did something happen to Mimi?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Hey, Mimi-chan, what is it you have to say?”</p>
<p>I told her that she didn&#8217;t have to be burdened with being a second-generation actress, however, she didn&#8217;t listen. Thus, as a way of making a memory, I arranged for her to pass the audition just this one time.</p>
<p>It was not absolute, but this was the best situation for her to grow mentally.</p>
<p>“I-I-I’m going to be a great actress!!!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my, why no—Ehhhhhhhhhhh!!!?!??”</p>
<p>“I wondered what you were going to sa—Ehhhhhhhhhhh!!?!????”</p>
<p>As we panicked, Mimi seemed to be content and did not respond.</p>
<p>She just finished her sentence, her breathing became rough, then blinked her powerful, glittering eyes.</p>
<p>It seems that I have to ask Asashiro-san for the details no matter what it takes.</p>

Rin’s older brother, Kou, relaxing in the living room.<br />
Knitting his eyebrows at his little sister’s unusual state.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>My pet theory is that connections and luck are a part of my ability. Thus, my pet theory is that those who became arrogant on the basis of connections and luck are just “to that degree”.</p>
<p>“Father! Mother! Brother!”</p>
<p>My younger sister, who came home breathing roughly, is currently in the maelstrom of it all. This must be the turning point of her career as an actress. Out of all things, she auditioned for a role with no connections. <span id='easy-footnote-5-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-18018' title='Flowingcloud: You sure about that? Seemed pretty rigged at the start.'><sup>5</sup></a></span>
<p>My father, who was relaxing on the living room sofa, and my mother, who was preparing dinner in the kitchen, took a quick look towards the front door due to Rin&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>“Rin! Wash your hands! Kou, set the dishes!”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p>
<p>My mother, who is known to the world as the news beauty, and my father, who is known as the Getsuki noble youth, were just an old lady and old man at home. It was worth seeing when even Rin, who has always passed off as a cool-headed girl, will tear off her innocent sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>Rin washed her hands and rinsed her mouth, then went to attack her father, who was lazing around watching TV.</p>
<p>“Father! Father! Listen to me!”</p>
<p>“Ohh, what is it? Take this.”</p>
<p>“Unya… that’s not it! I became friends with this amazing person!!”</p>
<p>“Ohh, I see, I see. In the audition with Juria-chan and Mimi-chan, right?”</p>
<p>“Yup!”</p>
<p>I quickly put out the plates before my mother yelled at me, then helped her prepare the food. After I eat, I read the script for the next drama, ahh, then I need to do some muscle training.</p>
<p>“The whole world will know about her just from her talking!”</p>
<p>“Hm? Did they pull out an ace from a training school?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Today was her first time.”</p>
<p>“First time?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for rookies to get lucky. Even the living legend Kiritani Ouka was said to have had beginner&#8217;s luck at first. It happens all the time in this industry.</p>
<p>You either become Kiritani Ouka or you end up nameless. Well, it’s no big deal to get lucky as a child actress, of course.</p>
<p>“You could only think that she was born like that! She was better than Brother!!”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>
<p>Hey, that is something I’m not going to let pass.</p>
<p>Yoruhata Kou, the second coming of famous genius actor, Kiritani Ouka, is worse than a new child actor?</p>
<p>There’s a time and place for jokes, but not now. <span id='easy-footnote-6-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-18018' title='Flowingcloud: Anyone get the Pokemon reference I just made? :)&lt;br /&gt;

<p>“Don&#8217;t just say random things. At any rate, she probably practiced behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Kou, you’re saying stuff like—”</p>
<p>“It’s different! It wasn’t practiced or anything like that! She was “the real thing”!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah, who knows. I mean, how can you tell she was the real thing or not? It’s different when it’s our old man or ma, but after all, Rin’s just a rookie, right? There’s no way they could possibly be better than me. Do you have a discerning eye?”</p>
<p>The best middle school student in the world.</p>
<p>The prince the Getsuki noble youth gave birth to.</p>
<p>A genius. An appropriate title for someone like me. Also, I’ve put in the proper great effort in proportion. A performance that no one, not just those in my generation, but even adults my age, can match.</p>

<p>How could I lose to a five, six, or seven-year-old kid? That&#8217;s not possible. That’s halfway around the zodiac you know? <span id='easy-footnote-7-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-7-18018' title='Flowingcloud: If you don’t understand, the Chinese zodiac is 12 years long.

<p>“Agh, but, hik, she was really, hik, really good, you know? Wahh.”</p>
<p>“N-N… I&#8217;m sorry, it’s my fault, don&#8217;t cry. Hey, I&#8217;ll give you some candy later!”</p>
<p>“Hey! Kou! You&#8217;re 13 years old and you&#8217;re making your younger sister cry!”</p>
<p>“Shit, Mother!?”</p>
<p>While feeling the strike of my mother’s fist striking the crown of my head, my grudge with that child actor became exacerbated. A genius child actor who is better than me? Hah, what the heck, that&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, I had high hopes. They all do such stupid performances. But what if they really are a good actor, even if they aren&#8217;t as good as me&#8230;</p>
<p>“How amusing.”</p>
<p>&#8220;You think my preaching is amusing? Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Y-You’re—”</p>
<p>At that moment—I might allow them to be on par with me.</p>
<p>“Although I got hit with a second helping of her knuckles, please spare me your revenge by adding more shiitake mushrooms onto my plate!”</p>
<p>“Good grief, only if it were Kou’s face and androgynous pretty boy appearance, but I wonder who he takes after?”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re the only one I don&#8217;t want to hear that from, got it?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Maho-san? Are you angry?”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>…Also, could you not add on the pain by flirting on top of my bump, stupid old man.</p>

<p>(Blackout)<br />
Old western-style Building (Night)<br />
(Lights)<br />
A black-haired female sits comfortably on a chair.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>The place was located in the suburbs, far away from the city center. Deep in the forest, the sun shone through the trees like a shower on an old western-style building. From a distance, it may look like a haunted house, but the closer one approaches, one can see that it has been carefully maintained—an elegant appearance.</p>
<p>The meticulously maintained flooring softly absorbed the sound of one’s feet. If one walked aptly, they would be able to move quickly without making a sound. It had been proven to be possible.</p>
<p>If one walked inside, they would find themselves in a spacious room with a fireplace. A beautiful woman was sitting in her usual position, at her usual angle, in her usual easy chair, reading a book.</p>
<p>However, the sound of a black rotary dial telephone unexpectedly made her sit up, tilting her head. There was only one person that came to her mind who would still call her old-fashioned phone.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Oh my, Ran-chan.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s been a long time, Aunty Ouka.”</p>
<p>The child of her older sister had a calming easy-to-understand voice that connected to her—the owner of the Western-style house, Kiritani Ouka.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m so glad you called. Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Actually—I found an outstanding talent.”</p>
<p>“Oh my.”</p>
<p>Ouka put her hand over her mouth and was elegantly surprised. Only this old Western-style building and the black cat yawning on the windowsill could have a glimpse at this action.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s no mistaking it if you say so. Who do they belong to?”</p>
<p>“She’s under Lowell’s newly established department.” <span id='easy-footnote-8-18018' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-8-18018' title='Flowingcloud: What the actual f*ck? Tsugumi’s dad is actually so cool. He set up an entire department for his daughter.&lt;br /&gt;

<p>“Lowell? The general trading company?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>If you mention Lowell, they are a monster enterprise that has achieved success in all of the various industries they have ventured into. Quite a few Lowell products were even part of Ouka’s daily life.</p>
<p>What resourcefulness for a newcomer to be connected with such a company. Ouka’s lips lifted in a natural, elegant way.</p>
<p>“How old are they?”</p>
<p>“Five. A five-year-old girl.”</p>
<p>“That so—Is that so…”</p>
<p>Five years old. That was the age when Kiritani Ouka made her debut. She had various emotional attachments about it.</p>
<p>“Good. Let me see them one of these days.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I understand.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, how stiff. Well, I guess that&#8217;s one of your good points though.”</p>
<p>When Ouka finished her call, she picked up a photo frame on the shelf. It was of her from when was still a child actress. Well, there was one person who shook her soul, even at this moment, a co-actor, who was reflected in the picture.</p>
<p>The picture of her with her long black hair hiding her eyes, her face twisted suspiciously, and her hand crawling up her own pathetically frightened neck—a snippet of one scene. A woman who shattered Ouka&#8217;s young self-esteem, who had been praised as a genius, however, without being conceited, carved out a way of life as an actor for Ouka.</p>
<p>After you disappeared, the understudy for the burnt body was a boring person.</p>
<p>“After you left us, the substitute for the burnt corpse was a boring person.”</p>
<p>She used to be called Sakura, her stage name as a child actor. She softly caressed the photo’s evil spirit.</p>
<p>“It has been twenty years since then. I&#8217;ve been waiting for you for a long time, you know?”</p>
<p>Of course, it was impossible for the person herself to come back. This is because Ouka saw her at the funeral dressed in burial clothes, her appearance too beautiful to act for her as she conducted herself as an actress.</p>
<p>However, that is not the case. What Ouka had continuously waited for twenty years was a person who would once again embrace an intense radiance that would carve out the soul of an actor on her.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m looking forward to the day when I&#8217;ll be alongside someone like you again—Tsugumi-san.”</p>

<p>A melancholy sound echoed in the Western-style building that had once been a stage.</p>
<p>That sound, which disappeared into the void somewhere, seemed to be filled with tenderness and elation.</p>
