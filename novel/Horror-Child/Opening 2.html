<h3>Theater 2 &#8211; Opening</h3>

<p>Tokyo Metropolitan, Shopping Mall (Day)<br />
Tsugumi is worried in front of the phone store.<br />
Recollection of the past.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>Cellular telephone. It refers to a device of civilization that has improved the telephone from a stationary device to a handheld device. Naturally, cell phones existed in my previous life… even in the time of Kirio Tsugumi, who died in a car accident in the year 2xxx. The main functions were phone calls and SMS. They were quite expensive and could be bought when one reached adulthood and became a member of society.</p>
<p>Now, in this life, I, Tsugumi Sorahoshi Lowell, am very wealthy, and my goodness, my parents are buying a cell phone for their child. Naturally, I do not believe that a cell phone is a very interesting object for a child to have, but if I am going to make a living as an actor, there’s nothing better to keep in touch with others with.</p>
<p>In my previous life, I had terrible parents, but my parents in this life are definitely good people. They noticed that I was hesitant about receiving an expensive item, such as a cell phone, and thought that I wouldn’t hold back with a friend, so they called Yoruhata Rin’s house, a new child actor whom I had befriended at the audition.</p>
<p>Rin&#8217;s parents were busy, so Rin-chan was the only one that came. You might think that we were just small children, but that&#8217;s not the case. In addition to my parents, there were security guard-like people surrounding us at a distance from our family…</p>
<p>“Eh, but, Rin-chan, this is a box. Where’s the buttons?”</p>
<p>“There aren’t any. You unlock it via face recognition, so you don’t need a password.”</p>
<p>“Face recognition… pass.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called a “smartphone” apparently. It seemed to be a portable computer with communication functions as its main function. Handheld size. The size of a Game Boy. The screen is a touch panel. It operates via finger. Doesn&#8217;t touching the screen leave fingerprints?</p>
<p>“Tsugumi, you’re amazing, but you kinda like an old granny.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… T-t-t-that isn’t true, you know? I’m a little girl, okay?”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re definitely a beauty, but you’re like a granny.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>“There, there.”</p>
<p>My parents smiled at me as I fumbled with the sample. If I looked closely at the phone, I could see a profile view wolf printed on it, which was a computer product that took the world by storm in my previous life.</p>
<p>This seemed to be my father&#8217;s company. I&#8217;ll say it again, it&#8217;s my father&#8217;s company. I wonder what&#8217;s going on with my family…</p>
<p>“This is the latest model. I&#8217;m going for this one next.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I will tell Yoruhata-san about it, so Rin-chan can take one as a thank you gift for today.”</p>
<p>“Ehhh! B-But since she&#8217;s a friend of mine, I don’t need anything as thanks.”</p>
<p>Ahh, she&#8217;s a good girl. She can properly hold back at her age and she can be considerate of her friends. She must have grown up in a good house. Her family must be very sensible people. I sure would like to meet them…</p>
<p>“Oh my. You’d be like a test user, so could you tell me how it works?”</p>
<p>“A test user… g-got it. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>My father and mother both looked at Rin-chan very affectionately. As a daughter, it makes me happy to know that my parents are kind to other children. In my previous life, well, you know.</p>
<p>“Thank you too, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“No, Rin-chan. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“??? You&#8217;re welcome?”</p>
<p>Ahh, how cute. She&#8217;s really cute. But she&#8217;s older than me… Rin-chan is six and I am five. It&#8217;s not that she was born earlier in the year, but that we were in different grades. To be specific, I’m enrolling next year and Rin-chan will be enrolling this spring. <span id='easy-footnote-1-18175' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-1-18175' title='Flowingcloud: The specific term the author uses is ‘早生まれ’ (haya-umare), which means born between 1/1 and 4/1. School in Japan starts in April, thus if you were born after 4/1, you start school the year after.'><sup>1</sup></a></span>
<p>“Rin-chan, do you want a different color? I wonder if there’s any cute colors.”</p>
<p>“You should get a pink or silver one, and then buy a cover in a color that matches.”</p>
<p>“A cover for your cell phone… like a silicone one?”</p>
<p>“Silicone? Well, it’s something like this.”</p>
<p>What she showed me was a case that covered the smartphone. I see. The screen is large. Is it so you can use it like a notebook? It&#8217;s hard for evil spirits to appear…</p>
<p>Geez, I should just get a matching one with Rin-chan with this sort of thing. Granny’s brain tissues are getting a bit tired…</p>

<p>Afterward, I somehow managed to finish the initial configuration, the facial recognition setup that looked like something from a spy movie, received an explanation on the basic instructions on how to install an app, and installed an app for a game called &#8220;Great Brave Fantasia&#8221;, had dinner with Rin-chan at a restaurant, then parted ways. <span id='easy-footnote-2-18175' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-2-18175' title='Flowingcloud: This is probably a parody of a social-network game called Brave Fantasia. It ended service in Jan 2021.'><sup>2</sup></a></span> Of course, we sent her home in our limousine. Her beautiful mother, who looked just like Rin-chan, came out and greeted us, but she was a bit flabbergasted when she saw the car. You’d be surprised when you see that, right?</p>
<p>I heard that she has an older brother, but it seems like he’s in the industry. A first-year middle school student with a job, sure enough, is an actor. Since Rin-chan is like how she is, I&#8217;m sure he must be a kind person. I&#8217;d like to meet him. <span id='easy-footnote-3-18175' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-3-18175' title='Flowingcloud: I wouldn’t be so sure after reading the last chapter…&lt;br /&gt;
Arocks141: Hey, just because he’s proud doesn’t necessarily mean he’s not kind. Although I do agree with you.'><sup>3</sup></a></span>
<p>“Did you have fun today?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>“Haha, that’s good. —Oh my, you got a message from Hinomoto TV.”</p>
<p>“Sure enough, the pass notice. Although it was obvious, good for you. As expected, my angel.”</p>
<p>“Really? Yayyy! Thanks, Daddy, Mommy.”</p>
<p>It seems like a text message had arrived on my parent’s device. The audition was successful. It said something like the scriptwriter was on a roll, and now they were working on the script. Rather, the scriptwriter is Akasaka-kun? You&#8217;ve grown up, haven&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Apparently, they wanted me to play a rather unusual role. Also written in the message was that they wanted me to come to the TV station for that and other meetings as well.</p>
<p>“We should probably be the ones to go ourselves, but well, that&#8217;s fine. Do you want to go?　Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>“Of course I’ll go!”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re so sweet, Tsugumi.”</p>
<p>If I had a producer from a TV station come to my house… Nah, as expected, that might be a bit too aristocratic. I can’t imagine it. Yeah… then again, my parents seem like they would do it.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Tsugumi, you belong to the agency that I started up, but there is someone I would like to recommend to be your manager, would that be fine with you?”</p>
<p>The agency you started up???</p>
<p>N-No, that’s not what I should pay attention to. Yeah.</p>
<p>“Daddy, what&#8217;s the proposal?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there a servant that you like?”</p>
<p>“Mikado-san!”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right, Miss Mikado Haruna.”</p>
<p>Mikado-san is in her fifties now if I remember correctly. However, she worked energetically and has a good character. I was fond of her. If anything, I liked her even before I recalled my memories.</p>
<p>“Her daughter is a fresh graduate. She has finished our rigorous training… induction training. I was going to assign her as a servant, but the person herself requested this. As long as Tsugumi is okay with this, I&#8217;m thinking of assigning her as a manager, but what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’s okay! I’m happy with this!”</p>
<p>If it was Mikado-san&#8217;s daughter, there wouldn’t be anything strange about her. I was bothered about my father correcting himself when he said “rigorous training”, but… well, there seem to be all sorts of rich people after all.</p>
<p>“Well then, let’s meet her daughter in a few days. Minako.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I&#8217;ve already made arrangements.”</p>
<p>“As expected of my Goddess.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, dear.”</p>
<p>…Oh dear, it’s getting hot. No, I shouldn’t, my thoughts were about to shift to an old lady’s. I&#8217;d like to hear the story of how the two of them met.</p>
<p>“That’s right, Tsugumi, we’ve also prepared a training facility. We&#8217;ve brought in a trusted trainer from overseas to help you out, so feel free to make use of them.”</p>
<p>“Ehh, really!?”</p>
<p>“Of course, if you don&#8217;t like the trainer, just tell us.”</p>
<p>“O-Okay.”</p>
<p>The power of money is all-powerful. I wonder if they gathered all sorts of training equipment. I was grateful, but let’s keep in mind to not ask for anything and everything.</p>
<p>At the same time, if I don&#8217;t like it, they’re probably referring to that. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m saying this myself, but my body in this life is a silver-haired, blue-eyed, Northern European fairy beauty. I’m half-Japanese, so I don’t have a sharp, foreigner-like look, but I do have the Japanese-like roundness. Because of this, I had this certain anime beauty. I guess they don&#8217;t want me to get into trouble like with the previous private tutor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to tell them. Her slight sexual misconduct did not injury my heart now, but I do not want that to indirectly hurt my parent’s hearts.</p>
<p>New Year&#8217;s drama.</p>
<p>Meeting.</p>
<p>…GureBure. <span id='easy-footnote-4-18175' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-4-18175' title='Flowingcloud: Mentioned once in the previous chapter, this is the abbreviation for Great Brave Fantasia, the parody social-network game the author created.'><sup>4</sup></a></span>
<p>Starting tomorrow, it’s going to be busy.</p>

<p>A Certain Place in the Tokyo Metropolitan, A Concrete Room (Morning)<br />
Two females were in conflict.<br />
The sounds of hitting echo in the narrow room.</p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p>A person bent down to avoid the spinning kick that cut through the darkness. Without delay, the opponent quickly tried to sweep their leg, but the person leapt away and avoided the blow. Did that person want to gain distance? No. It would be troublesome to deal with shooters. The person jumped into the opponent’s bosom and hit the opponent in the chin with the heel of the palm. It was within the person’s expectation that the opponent would duck. The person bent their elbow and switched to striking down with their elbow. <span id='easy-footnote-5-18175' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-5-18175' title='Flowingcloud: The author’s a pain in the ass. This third-person works in Japanese, not really in English.&lt;br /&gt;
Arocks141: Save… Me…'><sup>5</sup></a></span>
<p>The blow aimed at the solar plexus was caught. A counter immediately came flying, but as the hand stuck out, the head of the strike was hit and changed trajectory, furthermore, the person got close and grappled the opponent.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>The two crossed gazes. They predicted each other’s movements with their pupils. They swept their legs in accordance to their opponent’s movements, then took out a concealed short baton from their skirt hem and thrust it at the other’s throat.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;ve grown up, Koharu.”</p>
<p>“No, I am still far from Mother in the old days.”</p>
<p>“Haha, that’s right, you still have some way to go in terms of your humility.”</p>
<p>Mikado Haruna, a woman of old age although her skin has not lost its youthfulness, teased Koharu with an elegant smile.</p>
<p>“Now, all that’s left is for you to meet the Miss. I am sure you will do your best to keep up your training as a servant, as well as your full effort into your concurrent position.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>When Koharu spun the short baton in her hand, she tucked it into her skirt hem. The important short baton, darker than the darkness, was put away like air and disappeared.</p>
<p>This was the technique for storing dark weapons that has been handed down in the Mikado family for generations. Her adept skill could be associated with dexterity tricks. Then, Koharu gave a serious, sincere nod, then recalled the girl she had only seen in the materials who she will meet tomorrow.</p>
<p>(It’s my good fortune that I am the bodyguard-cum-manager of a Northern European fairy beauty. What should I do if she calls me, “Hey, dog.” Ahh, my chest won’t stop beating…) <span id='easy-footnote-6-18175' class='easy-footnote-margin-adjust'></span><span class='easy-footnote'><a href='#easy-footnote-bottom-6-18175' title='Flowingcloud: Yabai!&lt;br /&gt;

<p>She was snickering under perfectly controlled facial muscles.</p>
