<p>Abandoned Building (Night)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The running girl.</span></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Haa… haa… haa…”</p>
<p>A girl ran inside an abandoned building. The pretty clothes she was wearing were tattered with traces of dark red blood here and there.</p>
<p>“What for!? Why!?”</p>
<p>Her breathing was rough, and while she held an arm hanging limply, the girl looked back as if she was groaning.</p>
<p>“Hiroshi, Akira, and Emiko, they all died! Has your resentment still not cleared up!?”</p>
<p>Soon, the shouting, mourning, those bitter feelings shall come to an end.</p>
<p>“&#8230;A dead end? Why?”</p>
<p>The black wall obstructed the girl’s path, then she feebly beat the wall. An insidious chill crept down her spine. Her body, which should have been warm due to her movements, grew cold and stiffened from the unavoidable reality before her.</p>
<p>——Step, step, step.</p>
<p>The girl screamed a soundless scream when the sound of falling footsteps reached her ear. Even though she understood that screaming was meaningless.</p>
<p>——Step, step, step.</p>
<p>She shook her head and beat the wall as if her life depended on it, and blood trickled down from her broken nails.</p>
<p>——Step, step, step.</p>
<p>“No, no, no, no, I don’t want to die like this. I don’t want to die!”</p>
<p>The girl’s pupils were dyed with despair as she looked towards the source of the sound. In the moonlit abandoned building, there was not even the shadow of a person.</p>
<p>However, even so, it seemed like something was getting closer.</p>
<p>——Step, step, step.</p>
<p>“Uwaaaaaa, nooooooo!! Don’t come, don’t come!”</p>
<p>The sound</p>
<p>――Step.</p>
<p>was approaching</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>Step.</p>
<p>“Hhhhuh?”</p>
<p>Eventually, the sound stopped.</p>
<p>As if that sound had not existed from the beginning, only the sound of her own wheezing and breathing filled the quiet room.</p>
<p>“Did it, forgive me?”</p>
<p>The girl breathed a sigh of relief and sank down to the floor.</p>
<p>Her voice was quiet, but it certainly regained its composure.</p>
<p>On.</p>
<p>Her shoulder.</p>
<p>——■■■■■a.</p>
<p>“%&amp;*#(@&amp;”</p>
<p>A “sound” that could not be imagined in this world resounded.</p>
<p>“Cutttttt!!”</p>

<p>Abandoned Building (Night)<br />
The lights turn on. Kirio Tsugumi puts up her hair.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set’s lighting illuminated the stage. I lent a hand to my actress colleague who was catching her breath in front of me. Maybe because she had not snapped out of her role yet, but she received my hand with a cramped face.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>“Y-Y-Yes, thank you for your hard work. Tsugumi-san.”</p>
<p>Immediately changing my behavior after the recording is over is a self-defense mechanism that came from experience. When I do not do this, my partner performer will be hospitalized due to insomnia and they would blame it on me.</p>
<p>It was worth being remembered as a well-known horror actress, but it was not like I really wanted to become an evil spirit.</p>
<p>“Mannn, today was good too, Tsugumi-chan!”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Director.”</p>
<p>After greeting the staff, I headed to my next work site. It has been a quick 17 years since I entered the world of acting in my teens. I have made a name for myself as a “horror” actress in this industry.</p>
<p>I liked horror in the beginning, so I have no qualms about the current status quo. Of course, I have thought about the fact that I only get horror-related jobs, but in a certain sense, I should be satisfied as well.</p>
<p>I like Japanese horror, but my motto is to do anything if I receive the role. My goal was to carry people’s fears in Hollywood. I am not dissatisfied, but I am also not satisfied.</p>
<p>“Kirio-san, we’ll go to the next location by car.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>My exclusive manager prompted me to enter, then I got into the black car. The black hair that had been grown out for my role had to be crammed into a wig for my next job. After all, my next role was a moving burnt corpse.</p>
<p>I did a final check as I opened up the script to the site. I was not going to play a role that requires me to speak, but I need to know what the other actors are going to say. I think I will be fine with reading just the setting, but I still have time anyway, so I’ll check it. Ah, by the way, I will be performing with Sakura-chan next. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen her, but I hope she&#8217;s doing well.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Because I was so focused, I was a tiny bit slow to react. The manager’s warped face filled with fear was reflected in the rearview mirror. In front of me was a sleeping driver—embracing their steering wheel—driving a large truck.</p>
