<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p>First of all, thank you very much for picking up “Horror Actress Reincarnated as a Genius Child Actor”.</p>
<p>Well then, this is the first time I am writing an afterword, and I am lacking in understanding how to do it properly, or how to do it well or poorly. However, in order to meet the expectations of all of you who have taken the trouble to pick up this book and read this section, I would like to touch upon the main story while including things like, “What would have happened if X person was doing so and so at that time?” and the “What if?”s.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this work, horror actress Kirio Tsugumi dies in a car accident and is reincarnated as a silver-haired fairy girl, Sorahoshi Tsugumi, and the story begins. The period between her death and her awakening is 20 years. The worlds of her previous life and present life are connected, and naturally, the people who were involved in the time in which Tsugumi lived are still alive. So, what would have happened “if” Kirio Tsugumi had not died in the car accident?</p>
<p>As narrated in Tsugumi’s first-person POV, Kirio Tsugumi was an actor who was extremely stoic about acting. She made no mistakes as she studied acting, and was willing to do anything to improve her performance, even playing the villain roles. After all, “It would be such a shame not to perform such an interesting role.” In the situation Tsugumi survived the car accident that would normally have resulted in her death, she would be left with after-effects that paralyzed her bodily functions. If that becomes the case, she would be unable to move her body as she should and decide to retire from the entertainment industry and train the next generation. She would only be a so-called “evil spirit insider” and not be very well known. However, her ability is real, and she would be a person who would be popular in the industry rather than by the audience. Therefore, even after her bodily functions have been paralyzed, she sometimes receives work from the industry and people she has connections with.</p>
<p>Well then, in the main story Tsugumi’s memories of her previous life were restored by a fall. In this “what if” world, what if she were only a weak girl with a mental wound. The new private tutor that would be selected would be someone who would find it hard to injure her. A woman whose body is left in paralysis—Kirio Tsugumi. Originally, the two, who were supposed to have never met, had a chance encounter at that hospital. An impossible “what if” scene. I would like to share a small part of this “what if” scene with everyone who picked up this novel.</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you, Miss. My name is Kirio Tsugumi. You are Tsugumi-chan?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Y-Yes.”</p>
<p>“Without delay, before I become your private tutor, I have a secret to tell you.”</p>
<p>“A secret?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. In fact, I am—a former evil spirit.”</p>
<p>“Evil spirit… a ghost… ehhhhhhhh!?”</p>
<p>To be continued?</p>
