<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; The Pursuit of Forbidden Curse</h3>


<p><strong>1 &#8211; Sage Valery</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
At the border of the kingdom of Ralpha and the Principality of Ryju──deep in the forest, there was a laboratory.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ple, please save me...... please forgive me ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"Hii, it hurts, hurts, hurts, huuuuuuurts......"<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm not that persoooon! You're not a huma... gyaaaaaa!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What happened In the room, was a hell picture of pandemonium──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Subjects were suffering from constant and severe pain.<br class="calibre4" />
In despair, those who continued to be beaten──on the verge of mental collapse.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Everything came from magical experiments.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Good, keep going... your pain and despair will advance my research."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In front of the suffering subjects, he told them as if he sang.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was a middle-aged man with forty enthusiastic eyes and a strict atmosphere.<br class="calibre4" />
Wearing a reddish-purple robe.<br class="calibre4" />
He had a magic wand in his hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The Sage Valery was now renowned as the world's best wizard, and was also the one who took the role as a strategist at the hero's party who defeated the Demon King Vilgarodomus.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Magic is the art of stepping into the darkness of the heart of a person. In order to enhance the Darkness──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looking at their distressed expressions, his heart did not hurt.<br class="calibre4" />
He didn't feel anything.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery just observed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Kept his calmness.<br class="calibre4" />
Kept his cool-head.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Assessed their reaction and collected valuable data.<br class="calibre4" />
The accumulation would further refine the techniques he was studying.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Good, more torment ... more sadness ... more despair"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His heart was beating.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What Valery was searching for was the negative emotions of humans.<br class="calibre4" />
The origin of magic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If he could manipulate it freely, a new spell would have been completed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“Fufufufufufu …… hahahahahaha!”<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery echoed the laughter of pleasure.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The magic I once cast to my disciple was, I can call the technique that day as my masterpiece. But it's still not enough! There must be somewhere more intense, vicious, wicked, and strongest! Yes, there must be a technique that can gain power comparable to God or the Demon King. "<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The ultimate technique that might go beyond the forbidden spell “Chain of Darkness” practiced two years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
When it eas completed──Valery might have the power beyond humans and even the Demon King.<br class="calibre4" />
He could reach the area where no wizard has ever arrived since ancient times.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In front of him, over thirty subjects each had a moaning cry.<br class="calibre4" />
As expected, it would be their limit soon.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"All of them are waste."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery sighed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I have to find new lively subjects again."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The neighboring villages had already almost hunted.<br class="calibre4" />
No one was going to be a good subject anymore.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Have I to go a little further away──</i><br class="calibre4" />
When he was thinking,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Valery-sama, there is a report."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Several men entered the room.<br class="calibre4" />
They were Valery's escorts.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gu, gue~ ... this is ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A group of corpses scattered on the floor<i class="calibre6">──the just dead subjects──</i>soldiers who looked at that vomited immediately on the spot.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you vomited, go outside. Don't pollute my lab."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery raised his eyebrows.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm sorry then..... Ubu......"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He gazed at the escorts disgustingly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What is the report?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery asked.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm busy with my research. Make it short."<br class="calibre4" />
"Ye, yes. In fact, it seems that one of the subjects ran away."<br class="calibre4" />
"What's the number?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Ha. It's 372."<br class="calibre4" />
"Speaking of 372──That sample girl, huh?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He snorted.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I have already taken some prominent data. Just ignore her."<br class="calibre4" />
"Do I have to follow her?"<br class="calibre4" />
"The curse given to her is powerful. She will die if we leave her alone──she will be killed by monster."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery had already lost interest in the report.<br class="calibre4" />
Instead, look for a new subject.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The pursuit for the ultimate curse──the day I got there is near …… it's near…!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A skewed smile appeared at the mouth of that sage.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was been a few days since the "Saintess" disappeared before the people.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In the Ralpha Kingdom was in great turmoil.<br class="calibre4" />
Not surprisingly, the Saintess Irina that was popular in the world suddenly disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In fact, she had turned into an ugly Demonic beast and was still fighting the remnants of the Demon King's Army.<br class="calibre4" />
But people didn't know that fact.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Some seemed to guess the case in connection with the recent Riot's murder.<br class="calibre4" />
However, it would not be easy for them to reach me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If they didn't know what actually happened, it was hard to know me.<br class="calibre4" />
It seemed in public I officially had died in a battle with the Demon King Army two years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
Yuno and co would have reported like that to the country.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, that was more convenient for me.<br class="calibre4" />
People who were supposed to be dead were more likely to act without worrying about their identity<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
After that, Shia and I used horses to escape from the scene.<br class="calibre4" />
We deliberately chose a zone with many vicious monsters and chose a route that was hard to be chased.<br class="calibre4" />
There was no sign of pursuing so far, since we had carefully erased our footprints.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of course, don't lose guard.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina's voice orb had not yet been spread out.<br class="calibre4" />
It was still kept by Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Because it described the work had done by Yuno and co, it was necessary to determine the timing of spreading out.<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
My next stop was near the border between the Kingdom of Ralpha and the Principality of Ryju.<br class="calibre4" />
It was said that there was a laboratory of sage Valery there.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery was not always stayed permanently, but he often stayed in the laboratory.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That night, we were traveling through the forest.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Thick forests have poor possibilities.<br class="calibre4" />
From where monsters might appear, or robbers might attack.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't be more than 10 meters away from me."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told to Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She had been given dark skills [Dissection] and [Acceleration].<br class="calibre4" />
Even the best warriors would find it difficult to beat the current Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, if she was had a surprise attack, It didn't necessarily mean that she wouldn't lose her guard.<br class="calibre4" />
It was best to be in the absolute safe zone, within my skill range.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, I won't leave no matter what."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea grabbed my robe sleeve.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She approached my dead tree-like arm.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">...... No, It was not good if she was clinging like that.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Perhaps she was trying to comfort me, misunderstanding that I broke up from Irina, and I was heartbroken?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, It's not like if you have to cling like tha──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
When I tried to tell her,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Suddenly, a faint scream was heard.<br class="calibre4" />
From the front.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama, I'll check it!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea shouted.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I see, but if it's dangerous, return immediately."<br class="calibre4" />
"Acknowledged"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea, after said that, ran away with leaving a red trail.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was her high-speed movement skill [Acceleration].<br class="calibre4" />

 
 <p><strong>2 &#8211; Shea's Battle</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
Following Shea that had advanced first, I went ahead.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Keep moving slowly with my weakening feet──still at full speed.<br class="calibre4" />
The progress was slow and I frustrated.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I also wished I could use [Acceleration] ...<br class="calibre4" />
I approached the voice's source while feeling frustrated.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The distance to the enemy was about 40 meters remaining.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea seemed to had defeated most, with more than a dozen monsters corpses lying on the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Behind her was a frightened girl.<br class="calibre4" />
It seemed like she was being attacked by the monsters.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
.....This was strange.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I wondered.<br class="calibre4" />
How could that many monsters attack a single girl at once.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
No, the top priority now was to caught up with Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
Shook off my doubts in my head, I proceeded with all my might.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The rest is, that two──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea said dignifiedly and held again tightly her sword.<br class="calibre4" />
In front of her were two monsters side by side.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
One was a huge doll-type monster about 5 meters tall, "Flame Golem."<br class="calibre4" />
As the name implied, it was a golem that wrapped the entire body in flames, and good at long-range attacks utilizing strong defense and fire.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The other one was the two-headed tiger monster "Dual Tiger".<br class="calibre4" />
It had a powerful close-range fighting ability, and could fight at mid-range with magical wind and lightning bullets from its two heads.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Both seemed to be formidable.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, the HP of both was about 700 to 1,000.<br class="calibre4" />
If the two got within my skill range, they would die instantly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If Shea could not win, I'll defeat the enemies with [Fixed Damage].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As I went further, the fight between Shea and the two began.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The two-headed tiger first moved.<br class="calibre4" />
With a tremendous acceleration power, shaved the distance to her instantly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Acceleration]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But nobody could beat her in a speed game.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea easily avoided the Dual Tiger's charge and turned around and struck her sword on its back.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
No, just before that, Shea jumped backward in a hurry.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The point where she was standing a moment ago, a firebomb burned out.<br class="calibre4" />
That was an attack fired by the flame golem behind the dual tiger.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Gaa!<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The dual tiger pursued Shea, who jumped backward and lost her position.<br class="calibre4" />
Despite being a monster, it was a stunning combination attack.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──After that, when Shea narrowed the distance, the flame golem fired a flame of restraint, and the dual tiger set up to where she dodged.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That..... !! won't reach me...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea was in the state that she could not hide her frustration.<br class="calibre4" />
She succumbed to the flames that Flame Golem emitted continuously, and she couldn't move on.<br class="calibre4" />
There, the dual tiger attacked, and she was driven into the defensive.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....this is not good"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Indeed, her skills had a tremendous effect in close combat.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But Shea was not a professional knight.<br class="calibre4" />
She had good swords, and her arm was good because she had been guided by her sister who was a former knight commander.<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
However, there was an overwhelming lack of practical experience.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In the battle against Minotaur immediately after acquiring the skill and in the fight against Irina's escorts, the skill alone was able to overcome it, but it seemed that she was struggling with the opponents who well teamed up like this time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I may not able to win..... run away right now!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She shouted to the girl behind her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"A ... aa ....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But she couldn't stand up, as if she had been missing her waist down.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kuh, if I withdraw, she'll ──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her voice was full of impatient tone.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She had already realized.<br class="calibre4" />
It was difficult to win against these two things by herself now.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But still, Shea was trying to confront them to protect her.<br class="calibre4" />
Her soul was that of a real knight, even though she hadn't had any practical experience yet.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Or maybe her sister was so too.<br class="calibre4" />
Drew the sword for the weak.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With courage and pride, even if the opponent was stronger than herself.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She might be such a true knight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Hold up a little more, Shea. I'm going now──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I felt like whipping on this weakening feet as I advanced.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Another 20 meters..... 19 meters......<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kyaaaaaa..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea retreated to flame golem's flame.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Another 18 meters..... 17 meters..... 16 meters.....<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shia was further blown away by the wind and thunder magic bullets emitted by the dual tiger.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Uuugh....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Slammed to the ground, crouching unable to get up.<br class="calibre4" />
She might have been hurt or broken somewhere.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Another 15 meters..... 14 meters.....<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The dual tiger approached the fallen Shea showed its bared fangs.<br class="calibre4" />
The flame golem fired from behind.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Another 13 meters..... 12 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Almost there.<br class="calibre4" />
Please survive, Shea──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I won't run away.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea rose with the help of her sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"As long as there are people attacked in front of me, I will protect them with this sword... like my sister did..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Burned her fighting spirit and held tight her sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Dual tigers fired lightning and wind magic bullets, and flame golems fired flames.<br class="calibre4" />
From the front and left and right──There was no way to escape from magic attacks approaching from three directions.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──No.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I see, there is no need to escape from the very beginning ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea raised her sword with an expression that she noticed something.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Dissection]──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Activated the skill and swung the sword down.<br class="calibre4" />
All magical attacks that would otherwise be impossible with a mere steel sword had been cut off.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Dark] skill [Dissection].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The effect cut off everything.<br class="calibre4" />
Not only the substance, but also included magic──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The two monsters stopped moving confused.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was just a moment.<br class="calibre4" />
But that created a lot of value.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was able to close the last distance at that moment.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Sorry to make you wait, Shea"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In instant, [Fixed Damage]'s range caught the two.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gyuoooooooooooo.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With a terrifying scream, the fire golem and the two-headed tiger fell at the same time.<br class="calibre4" />
Their bodies turned into countless black particles that splattered and disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">I make it in time──</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was relieved to save Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And she managed to protect the girl she tried to protect by her life.<br class="calibre4" />

<p><strong>3 &#8211; Yulin</strong></p>

<br class="calibre4" />
"Are you okay, Shea"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I called out to Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In the aftermath of the monster's magic attack, there was scorch around her armor.<br class="calibre4" />
Blood was dripping from her left hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I was slightly injured, but I was fine. I was saved, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm glad you're safe"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Said that, then I turned my eyes to the girl scared behind Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Is she about the age of late teens?<br class="calibre4" />
The blue hair was cut at the shoulder, and the blunt eyes gave a pretty impression.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She wore a white and navy apron dress and a white headband.<br class="calibre4" />
It was a maid outfit that you could see in a noble residence.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No, stay away from me ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She stepped back with a pale face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What happened?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was asking that, but the maid girl just shook her head from side to side.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Isn't she scared?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea said.<br class="calibre4" />
For some reason, looked at me with a scornful stare,<br class="calibre4" />

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/4Vws3R7/12-usdz-B3e.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama is full of suspicious aura."<br class="calibre4" />
"Is that so?"<br class="calibre4" />
"It's like a villain's atmosphere."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, I had the power of [Darkness], and it was no wonder that such an atmosphere appeared.<br class="calibre4" />
Although,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"... Sometimes you say rudely, you are"<br class="calibre4" />
"Please excuse me"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She said that, but mischievously smiling.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Recently, she sometimes had such an expression.<br class="calibre4" />
A girlish smile appropriated for her age of seventeen.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Some time had passed since Riot, the enemy of her sister, died, and it might be that changes were taking place inside Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
Perhaps that feeling was starting to rise.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of course, sadness and anger would still take a long time to heal.<br class="calibre4" />
Or that day might not come forever.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Nevertheless──I felt that the changes in Shea were her own will to move forward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If I completed my revenge on everyone, would that day come when I could laugh like this?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"N, no, umm, that, it's not mean he's scary ... Well, that guy had a slightly scary atmosphere. He has a suspicious aura."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was told by a girl who just met for the first time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Right, haven't I say that?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea was proud of herself for some reason.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's your triumph"<br class="calibre4" />
"Fufu"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Being with me will make you unlucky"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The girl looked at us and gave a sad sigh.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha?"<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm──I can attract demons."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Darkness Pheromone].<br class="calibre4" />
It was said that the seal engraved on the subject by the technique emitted an aroma that attracts demon.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She was called Yulin, and she was a resident of a nearby village.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A few weeks ago, a wizard helped Yulin that being kidnapped.<br class="calibre4" />
And she was treated as an experimental body at that laboratory, and the aforementioned seal was carved.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She managed to escape after seeing the gap, but because the aroma increased at night, she seemed to have attracted such a powerful demon.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To date, she had been forced out of the outdoor experiment and it was said that many unrelated people were sacrificed.<br class="calibre4" />
It was suicide to go out alone with such a spell on her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You──Maybe, You didn't want to die from being attacked by demons, right?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With guilt, her consciousness.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm, scared....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In my question, Yulin did not affirm or deny.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
No more words than that, big tears were spilling out from her round eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
One after another.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The curse that was put on me. The people who got involved and died. That wizard was calm even after performing that terrible technique ..... all of that, scared..... Aah."<br class="calibre4" />
""That wizard".....huh"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I muttered.<br class="calibre4" />
Well, maybe ninety-nine percent, was that "guy".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"We'll unlucky if we're with you, because you're attracting demons."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, so please stay away from me"<br class="calibre4" />
"My skills will destroy all approaching enemies. So no need to worry."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I explained to Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You've seen it earlier, right. Where the monsters disappeared in an instant."<br class="calibre4" />
"B, but ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She was still worried.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Be relieved, Yulin. I've been helped many times by him. The power of Chrome-sama is real."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea said good words.<br class="calibre4" />
Did her words of the same sex, around the same age, created a sense of security, I wondered. And Yulin's expression became softened.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ah, That's late but.....Thank you very much for your help earlier."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin bowed deeply.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"And who is the "Wizard" who did that spell?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I went to the core.<br class="calibre4" />
I was expecting it, but I wanted to check it directly from Yulin's mouth.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin's expression was stiff.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"N, no, that is──."<br class="calibre4" />
"If you leaking it, you'll die, right?"<br class="calibre4" />
"……Yes"<br class="calibre4" />
"But anyway you will die if you are now. Not far away, attacked by a demon."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin breathed in with a gulp.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you are now, you have no future. If there is a way to survive, first tell me the situation, seek help, and to remove the cause drastically──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I stared at Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
Head on.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Are you going to fight, or."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Silence flowed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Eventually, Yulin exhaled as if had determined.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The spell that placed on me, that is... doing by Sage Valery, a member of the Hero's party."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
So, she confessed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"As expected, that is him"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's research facilities had to be investigated.<br class="calibre4" />
And the spell he'd done on Yulin was so likely he was researching.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He didn't think people were people.<br class="calibre4" />
Use whatever he could to explore magics.<br class="calibre4" />
Just as a tool.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That was Valery's view of human beings.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was terribly simple.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But, it was simple──he was strong and scary because of his simplicity.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"We're heading to Valery's place. Are you coming along, Yulin?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh"<br class="calibre4" />
"Aren't you at his lab before? If so, showing the directions will help much."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you go to him, you may see how to remove your curse. I think it's a benefit for you too. I and Shea will guarantee your safety."<br class="calibre4" />
"Leave it to me. I'll protect Yulin."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea smiled brightly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"To the laboratory....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin looked down with a thoughtful face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It will take courage to once again return to the place where you just had fleed.<br class="calibre4" />
If we were rejected, then it couldn't be helped.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was true that Valery's lab will have some sort of magic trap, so getting directions will help.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──Can, can I return to my original state?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin looked up.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's possible, but not absolutely."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I shook my head small.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Why did I make this suggestion to Yulin, I wondered.<br class="calibre4" />
Suddenly I asked myself.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Maybe I──overlapping her with myself?<br class="calibre4" />
Just like to Shea at that time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea and I were fighting for revenge.<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin was cursed against her will.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was the same for both Shea and Yulin that overlapped with my situation.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Therefore, it might have sprouted in one corner of my heart.<br class="calibre4" />
I wanted to help her if I could.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If I stay like this now..... I can never return to my original life."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin muttered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I want to see my family again. I want to meet my friends. I want to meet everyone in the village......"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her words changed into sobbing on the way.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Will you bet on that possibility, Yulin?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I asked her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The possibility that we can go to the lab and remove your curse"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin looked up and stared at me.<br class="calibre4" />
With her eyes wet with tears, straightly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──please by all means"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In her words of decision, the sobbing was no longer mixed.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>4 &#8211; In the Forest</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"To attract monsters at night── That means we shouldn't stay in town until we get to his place."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told Shea and Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
If we stayed in town, there was a danger that the monsters she attracted would attack the town.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's okay. I'm with you, so it's safe, Yulin-chan."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea held tightly Yulin's hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"With my skill, enemies within 10 meters will be annihilated. There's no need for Shea's help."<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm not worried about enemy attacks, that's..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea glanced at me.<br class="calibre4" />
Somehow it was a sneering sight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-san is a man, so."<br class="calibre4" />
"...There's no way,&nbsp; I'll try to do something wrong with Yulin, I won't do that."<br class="calibre4" />
"After all, Yulin-chan is cute"<br class="calibre4" />
"No, no way, I am ... Shea-san is much more beautiful."<br class="calibre4" />
"You're cute. be confident, Yulin-chan. Your maid outfit looks great."<br class="calibre4" />
"Ah, this outfit is just a hobby..... ehehe."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"But it's such a cute Yulin, so I can't overlook the danger of being exposed to the desires of many men."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea suddenly became a serious face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Hear? My sister once said, "All men are beast", "All men are demonic libido". Yulin-chan also has to be careful."<br class="calibre4" />
"All men are beast...... demonic libido......"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin repeated Shea's words.<br class="calibre4" />
I thought it was a biased view of men──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"So that means, did that mean Chrome-san wanted my body.....!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin looked at me with a surprised face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No, wait. The story is going in a strange direction."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Anyhow, it went crazy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The night getting late.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We were sleeping together side by side.<br class="calibre4" />
I was in the middle, the right side was Shea and the left side was Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What's wrong, you can't sleep?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I asked Yulin in a whisper.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
By the way, Shea was quietly asleep.<br class="calibre4" />
From that sign, Yulin seemed to be awake.<br class="calibre4" />
Was she so overwrought that couldn't sleep.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That's.........because, for the past few days since I fleed from the lab, I spent the night scared of monsters."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin also answered in a whisper.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Be relieved, because I'm on your side. Any monster will die before approaching."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I answered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's safe as long as you're on my side. ''<br class="calibre4" />
"... Is Chrome-san going to defeat Valery?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin raised her upper body.<br class="calibre4" />
In the darkness, She seemed to stare at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You maybe have a grudge to him. but, he's my revenge target. so I won't give him up."<br class="calibre4" />
"N, no, that's not what I mean, I don't think to take revenge."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin seemed to shook her head.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Could you be, did Chrome-san also undergo Valery's experiment?"<br class="calibre4" />
"In such a place. Thanks to him I almost died and I lost all my magic."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I explained.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The purpose of that magic was to strengthen the Hero Yuno.<br class="calibre4" />
But for Valery, it just an experiment.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"My skill is a by-product."<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm sorry. I ended up prying your....."<br class="calibre4" />
"No, it's okay. Sleep anyway today. I don't know if we can release the curse on your body, but it's possible. Go first to his place and look for a solution."<br class="calibre4" />
".....Thank you very much. Thanks for your kindness."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin seemed to smile.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm──kind?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Wrong, even now I just only thinking about my revenge.<br class="calibre4" />
I helped Yulin, it was true that there was a feeling I could not overlook the assaulted human, but also I took advantage of the guidance and information about the Institute.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That should it be.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I am……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
When I muttered, I heard a breath.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This time, Yulin seemed to have slept.<br class="calibre4" />
Surely she was tired.<br class="calibre4" />
She fell asleep very quickly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
......I will sleep for a while.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Took revenge on Valery──I've decided to nourish that spirit.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was dawn and we woke up.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The sky was still dark.<br class="calibre4" />
A little more until sunrise.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....Chrome-sama"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea was already awake.<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin was still asleep.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What's wrong?"<br class="calibre4" />
"There's a little story"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I can't go too far away from Yulin-chan, but if a little more."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yeah"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We moved a few meters away from Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ugh....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was going to fall due to out of balance.<br class="calibre4" />
My feet seemed to be getting tired during the trip.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea supported me from the side.<br class="calibre4" />
We would look like hugging each other.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was her face, so close.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ah ...I, I'm sorry."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea blushed her face.<br class="calibre4" />
For some reason, She kept hugging without trying to leave me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"My bad. It seems I more tired than I think."<br class="calibre4" />
"No, Chrome-sama is weak and if I can support──I want to support you."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea was staring at me.<br class="calibre4" />
Her cheeks were still reddish a bit<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"And, what is the story?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I went back to the main subject.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....I didn't notice last night, but this morning I think a bit ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea glanced at Yulin sleeping a few meters away and muttered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The possibility of a trap?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I asked.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded small,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I can't see Yulin-chan as a bad girl. But is it possible that Valery used her and she wasn't aware of her and also some sort of trap has been put in......Isn't that possible?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was likely, based on Valery's personality.<br class="calibre4" />
But, there was a prerequisite, and that was, he was aware of me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Isn't Valery who did the spell on Chrome-sama. He probably know that Chrome-sama still alive and has the power of [Darkness]."<br class="calibre4" />
"It's not impossible"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I nodded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Not to mention, I'm already taking revenge on Riot and Irina. With that fact, it's no wonder he's reasoning about my survival and skill."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Especially, for he who had the most detailed knowledge of [Light] and [Darkness] in the Hero's party.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Or maybe he has prepared a way to counter Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And, Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"There is an interval of 3 seconds for [Fixed Damage] skill works. If there is an opponent who can not be killed, I will protect you with all my might."<br class="calibre4" />
".....I'll ask you then"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
An enemy that wasn't killed instantly after received 9999 damage, there was no way such an enemy exist.<br class="calibre4" />
But it was not absolutely.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was encouraging to see Shea, a knight with excellent melee capabilities, coming to my side.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Of course. I'm your [Subordinate]. I'm Chrome-sama's──knight, after all."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea declared.<br class="calibre4" />
Her chest glowed brightly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea expanded her chest's cloth astonishingly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Surprisingly in the valley of her rich chest revealed patterns that shine in black purple.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A crest that looked like a heart.<br class="calibre4" />
It was proof of [Subordinate].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The crest was──changed from black purple to crimson.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>5 &#8211; To the Laboratory</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
I gazed at the crimson crest on Shea's chest.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You also had that crest."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Perhaps it was carved when she became [Subordinate].<br class="calibre4" />
Her cloth and armor got in the way, so I couldn't see it at that time──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
When Irina became a [Subordinate], the place where the crest appeared was on the forehead.<br class="calibre4" />
Did the location change depending on the other party, or did it had another meaning, I wondered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Moreover, the color of the crest had changed.<br class="calibre4" />
From black-purple to crimson.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina's crest remained black-purple until the end, so the difference might have some meaning.<br class="calibre4" />
……<i class="calibre6">Do I have to ask her?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The color of Shea's crest has changed, what does it mean?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Tried to call [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was no reply.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Answer me, [Darkness]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />I called her for a few more times.<br class="calibre4" />
I called her in my heart, but there was no response.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....a whimsical guy"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was no help for it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
After a while, the brilliance of the crest subsided.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ah..... n, no, Chrome-sama, don't look at me.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea suddenly turned her face red and hid her chest.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....Aren't you that have exposed your chest"<br class="calibre4" />
"Tha, that's right. No, I'm sorry."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Was she still upset</i>, her eyes were swimming.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Is the crest there from before?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, since when I became Chrome-sama's [Subordinate]."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded to my question.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Sometimes it glowed as it did just now, but usually it invisible."<br class="calibre4" />
"I see"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
So I didn't notice it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....My chest, you looked it, right?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She suddenly glared at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No, no matter what I did just now, it would clearly come to sight."<br class="calibre4" />
"Can you be, had an evil desire toward me?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Still, as usual, you sometimes say rude things."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Nn……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was a voice of Yulin in the back.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Fuaa..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I heard a cute yawn.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"My bad. Did I wake you up?"<br class="calibre4" />
"No, I had been up for a while. I couldn't help but listen to both of you were flἰrting pleasantly."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As Yulin said, she turned her eyes off awkwardly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ah, am I in the way? Should I have pretended to sleep a little more.... as I thought, both of you in that kind of relationship, right?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
……<i class="calibre6">Nn?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh, ah, it, it's wrong, Yulin-chan. just now was a misunderstanding."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea shook her hands in panic.<br class="calibre4" />
Blushed again, she took a glance toward me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That is, umm, about Chrome-sama..... I think, it would be a lie if you weren't aware of it, but ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"Fufu, maiden mode right, Shea-san"<br class="calibre4" />
"N, not, Yulin-chan"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The smiling Yulin and panicked Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
It was a strange atmosphere again.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Anyway"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In order to shake off that kind of atmosphere, I cleared my throat once,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"We'll head to his laboratory──"<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
In a laboratory room surrounded by many magical experimental devices.<br class="calibre4" />
There, seven boys were chatting.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Recently, Valery-sama often "appointed" you, right."<br class="calibre4" />
"Th, that's not true."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Asked, Mikha hurriedly shook his hands.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm just as much as everyone....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While saying, he sighed a hot sigh, remembering a moment with Valery last night.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha was a young boy with an androgynous look, with pale pink hair trimmed at the shoulder.<br class="calibre4" />
He was one of the seven favorite disciples of the sage Valery.<br class="calibre4" />

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/5hmMsvz/13-ICkfo-Wr.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<br class="calibre4" />
"As much as? You are most often called to his bed."<br class="calibre4" />
"You stand out too."<br class="calibre4" />
"Tsk, That's Master's favorite number one for ya?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The look of jealousy and envy seemed to pierce.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha managed to parry and looked around at the six boys.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Each of them had different features from themselves, but they had a rare beauty and had a slender body.<br class="calibre4" />
It could be seen that the master's homosexual hobby was strongly visible.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Everyone was Valery's lover, and every time Mikha was appointed, he spent a mesmerizing night with his master.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery, who was a member of the Hero's Party that defeated the Demon King and was called the world's greatest wizard, for his disciples he was equal to God.<br class="calibre4" />
He was invited to bed at night and could not refuse it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In addition, by receiving Valery's favor, he might be given a special mystery of magic, Of course, there was also a calculation.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, it would be the same for the other disciples.<br class="calibre4" />
They were competing not only for their magical power, but also for won the love of the man-lover Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Everything was──in order to succeed Valerie's trace and eventually become the world's greatest wizard.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Speaking of which, a subject girl ran away."<br class="calibre4" />
"Is that the cute girl in a maid outfit?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The topic of the disciples had changed.<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha felt relieved inside.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Goddamit, I thought I'd taste it someday."<br class="calibre4" />
"Give up give up. Some magical rituals require a virgin condition. If you commit arbitrarily, you will be punished later."<br class="calibre4" />
"I know, You can't touch such a cute girl with one finger or you'll die, right?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Well, when it's finished its role as a guinea pig, it's possible that it will come to us."<br class="calibre4" />
"When it comes to us, there are too many patterns then its body and mind are broken."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The boys chated.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Despite having a relationship with Valery, their desires were exclusively women.<br class="calibre4" />
Some swords also could be used to both men and women──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Nn?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha looked at the magical device for the alarm and slightly raised his eyebrow.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What's wrong, Mikha"<br class="calibre4" />
"That is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The lamp was lit in red.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"There are people approaching this institute──"<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>6 &#8211; Break Into 1</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
A huge black-painted building rose several hundred meters ahead.<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's Magic Laboratory, located at the border area of the Kingdom of Ralpha and the Principality of Ryju.<br class="calibre4" />
Proceeding deeper into the forest, we finally arrived.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This was my first time to come here, when I was a disciple of him, I had heard only about the laboratory.<br class="calibre4" />
Aiming at the results of Valery's magic research, the invasion of other wizards was endless.<br class="calibre4" />
Therefore, it seemed that defensive magics were multiply applied to doors, walls, and even inside.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Let's go"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I called on Shea and Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />We proceeded straight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Certainly, that main gate fired lightning magic when an intruder approached within 30 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
When I was investigating it from my memories....., my eyes were covered with a pale glow.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Probably that was as powerful as the high-tier magic "Thunderblast".<br class="calibre4" />
The surrounding ground exploded and burned.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Two or three more.<br class="calibre4" />
We proceeded calmly in the rain of lightning.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
All the lightning that reached within 10 meters around me had disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
[Fixed Damage] also causes 9999 damage to the attack toward me.<br class="calibre4" />
Even "Thunderblast" was inevitable.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Flashes of Lightning that struck at a distance more than 10 meters scattered the explosive light, but we ignored it and proceeding forward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Eventually, we reached the front of the iron door.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That door could not be destroyed with [Fixed Damage].<br class="calibre4" />
Because unless it was a creature that was my enemy or an attack against me, it would be excluded from fixed damage.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Fixed Damage] could not give an effect on such mere doors or walls.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, I leave it to you"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded reverently and pulled out her sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That blade was covered with a black shine.<br class="calibre4" />
It was the shine of a [Darkness] skill [Dissection] that I gave her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea swung down her sword cut through an iron door that was a meter thick like butter.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We continued without problems.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Passing through the gate, there was a passage about 50 meters to the entrance.<br class="calibre4" />
On the left and right were statues of demonic beasts.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It feels really good"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Muoooooo~.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Some roaring sounded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That stone statues shook all at once, and then becoming real demonic beasts and heading for us.<br class="calibre4" />
Those guardian stone statues were the demonic beast gargoyles.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Giiiaaaaaa.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The next moment they raised screams.<br class="calibre4" />
All of that demonic beast that came within my skill range received 9999 damages and shattered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Only countless debris left behind.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'll get inside."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I went straight and turned all the gargoyles that approached into rubble.<br class="calibre4" />
At the entrance, there was a door with magic to repel intruders, but this was also cleared in the same way as the main gate.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We entered the building.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Magic traps were set up everywhere in the laboratory.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At the moment of passing a specific place, attack magic launched.<br class="calibre4" />
Or a part of the wall was cracked, and from there monsters instead of guards appeared.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, it didn't matter to me how powerful the magic was or whether the monster stood in my way.<br class="calibre4" />
All magic would be erased.<br class="calibre4" />
Monsters would be instantly killed when they were within range, unless they were in the same boat as the Demon King or the aides.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With [Fixed Damage], I dealt all the attack magics and the monsters and made them disappeared, then I proceeded with Shea and Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Our destination was the innermost part of the laboratory.<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's dedicated laboratory was said to be there.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Currently, he had seven disciples, and he was doing various magic researches and experiments at this institute with them.<br class="calibre4" />
A number of……..outrageously cruel human experiments.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Those who were the victims of that experiment, would have serious aftereffects on their body and spirit, or had been transformed into monsters, or suffered severe pain, grief, remorse, and despair──.<br class="calibre4" />
There were a lot of stories that disgusting to be heard.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I did not know what Valery was aiming to cursed me with the "Chain of Darkness" spell.<br class="calibre4" />
In the first place, I didn't have any feelings about it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But, I could be sure, it was related to that outrageously cruel things.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──wait for me, Valery"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I kept walking while gritting my molars.<br class="calibre4" />
Just like whipping my feet that weakened by his magic, I moved forward and forward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I will give you a proper punishment.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Used [Fixed Damage] to erase the monsters, cut the wall with Shea's [Dissection], and proceed in the shortest distance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“As I thought, it’s amazing…!”<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin was looking at me and Shea with reliable sight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'll leave the guidance for you. My purpose is revenge on Valerie, but you want to release the curse on you. And first of all, Let's find out how to release it."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And I.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Bastard, you intruders!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Did you not know that this place is Sage Valery's laboratory!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Two magicians appeared from the front of the passage.<br class="calibre4" />
The distance was about 20 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Who are they?"<br class="calibre4" />
"They're Valery's.... disciples. They mainly manage us the subjects....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin's voice was trembling.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"They didn't treat the subject as human, broke us like a tool, then killed..... They're cruel people."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her face was pale.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"All is well, Yulin-chan"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea hugged her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"We'll protect you"<br class="calibre4" />
"Now then, I'm here to steal your master's research achievements!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And Valery's disciples shouted.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"As if I'll allow you to do that! For the sake of my dear master──I will attack you here now."<br class="calibre4" />
"That's right! As proof of my love for Master Valery!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While ecstatically dyeing their cheeks, the two beautiful boy magicians pointed their staff at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
........By the way, I'd heard the rumors that Valery had a man-loving hobby.<br class="calibre4" />
When I was at the Hero Party, The reason he didn't reach out to me might be because I was not his taste.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Fire Blast]!"<br class="calibre4" />
"[Wind Blast]!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The two had respectively shot high-tier magic of fire and wind.<br class="calibre4" />
Moreover, that was without chanting.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──Not bad.<br class="calibre4" />
Their ability as a magician would be better than me when I was at the Hero Party.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Probably they at the same boat as a court magician class.<br class="calibre4" />
As expected of the people who was Valery's disciples.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"But──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The fierce flames and swirling winds were.<br class="calibre4" />
At the moment reached a distance of 10 meters from me, that attacks disappeared into countless particles of light.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>7 &#8211; Break Into 2</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
The high-tier magic of fire and lightning suddenly disappeared before my [Fixed Damage].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha~!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That two pretty-boy magicians made a startled voice at the same time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I proceed with Shea and Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Da, dammmiiit, this guy.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Why our magic is──" (PTW/N: Hmmm, do not know at all, why are they, those blushing pretty-boys, referred themself as ore(tachi) instead boku, or atashi(LoL))<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
They shot attack magics one after another, but there was no way they could break through the interception of [Fixed Damage].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
15 meters remained.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I want to ask one question"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I stopped advancing.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What have you done to the lab subjects? Also, what do you feel of those people?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The two raised their eyebrows at the same time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"There can be no such feeling for just experimental materials."<br class="calibre4" />
"Rather, to become the cornerstone of our magical research. They should be proud of themself."<br class="calibre4" />
"They must thank us!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
They laughed and shot more magic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"……So that's it"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I very understood.<br class="calibre4" />
Even their natures were very similar to their master, Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I started proceeding again.<br class="calibre4" />
This time without stopping, I didn't feel the need about it and continued to move forward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
13 meters..... 12 meters..... 11 meters.....<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Wh, why..... why is our magic.....gaaaa~?!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of the two, the one who was positioning himself at the front spurted blood first.<br class="calibre4" />
Along with that scream, he turned into countless particles and disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Where is Valery?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I glared at the remaining one.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The distance was about 12 meters away.<br class="calibre4" />
If he got a little closer, he would die.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Answer me"<br class="calibre4" />
"Uuu……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was standing with a pale face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was just like a frog stared by a snake.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Definitely he was very confident with his magic.<br class="calibre4" />
With his magic completely useless, and his ally was killed, made him completely lost his fighting spirit huh.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If he just spat out on Valery's whereabouts, It would be easy and saved me──<br class="calibre4" />
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<br class="calibre4" />
"Th, there's no way, such a thing..... it's too overkill....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha and co were stunned when they saw the battle projected on the magic video device.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Matthew……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of the two who went to intercept the intruders, one easily vanished.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
By a mysterious man in a hood and cloak.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Is that──a magic?<br class="calibre4" />
However, the activation of magical power was not recorded.<br class="calibre4" />
Moreover, to high-tier magic──he had never heard of a spell that could instantly obliterate two types of magic attacks with different attributes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What did that guy had done?<br class="calibre4" />
What kind of technique he had done to make attack magics and Matthew vanished?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha could only be pale for that an unintelligible event.<br class="calibre4" />
The same was true for the other four.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What's wrong? What a fuss."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A man entered the room.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The age was forty years old.<br class="calibre4" />
A beautiful man with long bluish-black hair.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Sage Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was one of the best wizards in the world and was the master that Mikha loved.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Master.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha reddened his cheeks.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was called to his bed last night and the memories he had until the morning revived vividly.<br class="calibre4" />
Just like a maiden in love, Mikha turned to Valery with a shy smile on his face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery nodded lightly to him,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Is it an intruder? And you said that my disciples were killed....."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Matthew and Miguel headed to intercept, but Matthew has vanished by a mysterious attack. Miguel seems to have been cornered."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha answered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....Hmm. Matthew is an excellent flame-element user and Miguel is a lightning-element user. Both of them should have the ability of the court magician class."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery growled and turned his eyes on the video projection.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This sign is ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His eyes were wide open.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Is it the power of [Darkness]? However, that is an area where even I, the one who researching [Darkness], have not reached....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's eyes were opened.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was the first time Mikha saw his expression.<br class="calibre4" />
What made his master who was always calm, to be so surprised.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Just calling [Darkness], and fully utilize its power are areas in completely different dimensions──who actually is that guy?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery murmured.<br class="calibre4" />
Eventually, with a smiley face,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Could it be, him...!? No, he should've died....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Then,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Master, please leave it to me!"<br class="calibre4" />
"No, please let me do!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Other disciples had made their way.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Was it the way to show to Valery their good points here?<br class="calibre4" />
They might have the intention of competing against Mikha, who was currently receiving the most favor from their master.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....Hmm. If so, go with all of you."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery jerked his chin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This intruder is not just an ordinary person, but all of you possess the power of a court magician class, like Matthew and Miguel. Unless you all work together, you won't be able to win."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While saying such words, the light in his eyes was strangely cold.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──Could it be.<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha suddenly thought.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was an intuition.<br class="calibre4" />
He wondered if Valery would sacrifice his disciples against that mysterious intruder to determine his abilities.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looked it was tough, and he wondered that Valery was going to discard him and them away.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
(No, such a thing won't happen. Last night, he loved me so much. Valery-sama won't forsake me.....)<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Desperately convinced himself, Mikha was anxious about Valery's cold eyes──.<br class="calibre4" />



<p><strong>8 &#8211; Break Into 3</strong></p>



<br class="calibre4" />
"Hi, hiiiii, don't kill me! Don't kill me!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That boy fell into the spot.<br class="calibre4" />
He was looking up at me, while trembling and rattling.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If so, tell where he is. And also──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I pointed to Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The way to remove the curse on this person."<br class="calibre4" />
"Subject number 372....!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That boy was taken aback..<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"She seems to have been cursed with [Darkness Pheromone] spell. There's any way to dispel it, isn't?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I decided to hear from him first.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I, I don't know..... I don't know at all"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That boy trembled and shook his head to the left and right.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Not willing to say, huh."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I sighed and said with a slight threat.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I, I really don't know! Trust me! Please, don't kill me!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The boy pleaded with tears in his eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
From that pathetic appearance, apparently he really didn't know at all.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"But.... Valery-sama is the only one in charge of all the magic research results, so if you look for him....."<br class="calibre4" />
"Where is that recording orb?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Usually, the results of magic research were stored in orbs that could record high-density information.<br class="calibre4" />
Maybe Valery was doing so too.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That boy's face turned pale.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The research result of magic was equal to the top-secret for the wizard.<br class="calibre4" />
Furthermore, it was Valery's, the world's greatest wizard, so it had immeasurable value.<br class="calibre4" />
There was no way he could talk about his whereabouts and the orbs storage location.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Say"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I took a half step.<br class="calibre4" />
Just a little closer, he would disappear.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"A, alright ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The boy gulped and nodded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The lowest floor of the institute. Go down the central stairs, then head towards the inner second room──there's a place that we call "Sage's Compartment"."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Then, how about we go there to find out how to remove Yulin's curse?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Yosh, let's go back to the first question."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I had my chin jerked.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Spit out his whereabouts"<br class="calibre4" />
"Valery-sama is in the middle of ritual magic ... researching a new technique ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And the boy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"As usual, he's still researching wicked magic that requires a sacrifice huh?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Y, yes, with the hearts of seven virgin maidens and the reproductive organs of ten virgin boys of the neighboring village..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
......Tsk, that information didn't even need to be heard.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Where is he doing that ritual magic?"<br class="calibre4" />
"On the underground floor..... It's a room behind of the "Sage's compartment" that I mentioned before......... for ritual only....."<br class="calibre4" />
"I get it"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I've asked that far<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Then, die."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I proceeded one step.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The distance with him was 11 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
1 meter left.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh, the promise is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The boy had a stunned look.<br class="calibre4" />
I coldly looked at that boy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You've taken the lives of many subjects so far, right? So, do you think you could be forgiven now?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was no room for sympathy.<br class="calibre4" />
There was no reason to forgive.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Be, because those guys are just ordinary villagers who can be found everywhere, you know!? We are magician geniuses who appear for every tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years ──we're selected human beings!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He shouted.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please don't kill me! I'm a special person! I can't die in a place like this!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was a self-centered guy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Just like his master, until the bones.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I took one step further.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Uwaaaaaaaaa I don't want to die! I don't want to di..... Gyaaaaaaaaaa....."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Along with the death agony, that boy spurted his blood out and fell, and eventually disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"He, he has disappeared ... Valery's disciples are so scary ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin murmured with a stunned face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It doesn't matter who will come out."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told Yulin<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'll just erase everything"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We went further.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We went down the stairs and eventually arrive at the lowest floor.<br class="calibre4" />
There were many traps in the way, but all of them were destroyed by my [Fixed Damage] and shea's [Dissection] and [Acceleration].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A few wizards appeared from the front of us.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You can't go further from here onwards, you intruders!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Do you not know that this is Valery-sama's laboratory!"<br class="calibre4" />
"I will defeat you for the sake of my beloved Valery-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Hey, these guys were also Valery's lovers.<br class="calibre4" />
Every of them was a fine beautiful teenage boy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
…….Valery's hobbies were fully open.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, he was not a man who took disciples only for his own hobby.<br class="calibre4" />
Probably all of them were as powerful as the previous two.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
They couldn't do any harm to me, but Shea and Yulin were in danger if they got out of [Fixed Damage] skill range.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't separate from me, you two"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I instructed them.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I am one of Valery-sama's disciples, Mikha. Wh, who are you.....?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A very beautiful boy at the rear asked.<br class="calibre4" />
He looked like a pretty girl with pale pink hair trimmed at his shoulders.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"At least not Valery's friend."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I snorted at that "Disciple".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I came here to do business with your master."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I would not introduce myself, I would only tell what I wanted to do.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....It looks like it's not a peaceful business."<br class="calibre4" />
"I've already made two of your fellows disappeared. Of course, it's not a peaceful business."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While saying it, I felt their hostility and hatred continued to simmer.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Apart from that, I had no personal resentment toward that Mikha.<br class="calibre4" />
Well, like the two disciples I mentioned, I thought he was repeating wicked experiments, so there was no reason to keep him alive.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ah, he is a wonderful wizard. He has developed many magics and will surely contribute greatly to the progress of the world's magical civilization!"<br class="calibre4" />
"To be precise, repeated the human experiments, right?"<br class="calibre4" />
"That, that's..... for the sake of world, precious sacrifice needed....."<br class="calibre4" />
"Just arbitrary reason"<br class="calibre4" />
"More people will be saved. This is the pain needed for the world!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha emphasized.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I respect him from the bottom of my heart! I believe at him and will continue to follow! And someday, I will be his successor."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was like a feeling of blind faith.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Maybe because you're Valery's lover. It's an affection rather than respect right? or it's a desire? Or selfishness?"<br class="calibre4" />
".....! W, what your relation with──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha's face flushed.<br class="calibre4" />
Did I hit the right place or touched a part he didn't want the other to touch?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's good! You are an evil intruder who came to do damage to Valery! I understand that!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Oh, I'm about to finish it up."<br class="calibre4" />
"Be careful. he has a way to erase magic."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Those disciples grasped their wand with caution.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"... I see, so you're watching the previous battle with a magic video relay or something huh."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, it didn't matter what they saw.<br class="calibre4" />
All I had to do was erase them.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
These guys attacked ── together.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
── The battle was just a disappointing thing.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Swords of flames, spears of lightning, arrows of ice, axes of the wind──.<br class="calibre4" />
All disappeared the moment reached within 10 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It didn't matter what its attributes or how powerful it was.<br class="calibre4" />
In front of the attack magics that approached continuously, I kept on going lazily.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea and Yulin were on my left and right side.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Eventually, the disciples who entered my skill range disappeared like the magic they released.<br class="calibre4" />
One, and one more ...<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Hi, Hii..... I can't...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The last one── Mikha screamed and ran away.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Do you want me to chase him, Chrome-sama?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea asked.<br class="calibre4" />
With her [Acceleration], she would catch him up soon.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──No, leave him alone."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
No needed to chase him after all.<br class="calibre4" />
There was something I wanted to do first.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of course my revenge on Valery, but I want to find out how to dispel Yulin's curse first.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We went straight.<br class="calibre4" />
As what was spilled by the previous first disciple, we went to the second room from the central stairs of the inner-part.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Sage's Compartment".<br class="calibre4" />
A place where Valery's magical research results were stored.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The door was tightly closed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea's sword emitted a black glow, tearing through the layers of the door protected with magics.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'll open it"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We set foot inside the room──.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>9 &#8211; The Sage Compartment</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
We set foot in the room containing the results of Valery's magical research, the Sage Compartment.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The shelves on the right side of the room were lined with innumerable orbs.<br class="calibre4" />
Each one of them should contain his research data.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looking at the other side, I saw several black crystal pillars.<br class="calibre4" />
Various humans, regardless of age or sex, were confined inside it, stark naked.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Hurts... it hurts..."<br class="calibre4" />
"Help me..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Heartbreaking voices echoed everywhere.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Was it a mechanism that caused pain when in the crystal, or was it caused by some magic test?<br class="calibre4" />
Screams and sobs, anger and resentment ──I could hear all of it clearly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was a hell picture.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"They're the human subjects same as me..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin murmured with a dark face.<br class="calibre4" />
......Had she encountered the same thing?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was taught when I was still Valery's disciple.<br class="calibre4" />
He was said that magic was a technique that used a person's "negative emotions" as an energy source.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The higher the magic, the more "negative emotions" were needed.<br class="calibre4" />
Pain, wrath, sorrow, remorse, and despair.<br class="calibre4" />
It was the same kind of emotions I used to taste.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
They would experience endless pain to activate some spells.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I couldn't bear any longer.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──Shea"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I ordered my [Subordinate] girl.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I understand, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She took my order, even if I didn't put it in concrete words.<br class="calibre4" />
No, she would have done so on her own, even if I didn't order her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──[Dissection]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A black shining sword cut through the crystals one after another.<br class="calibre4" />
Freed the people contained inside.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Those who can move, immediately escape from here. All the traps on the road we went through have been destroyed."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And she explained to them the escape direction.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Th, thank you very much……"<br class="calibre4" />
"Uu……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Most of them stood up with a squeal and then left the room.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The remaining dozens seemed too distressed to even stand up.<br class="calibre4" />
I wish I had a way to treat them.<br class="calibre4" />
And,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I turned my gaze to the back of the room and stiffened my face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A shabby stone plate was leaning against it.<br class="calibre4" />
Was it a mural cut from somewhere──I wondered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The hill and countless tombs were depicted.<br class="calibre4" />
A long chain hanging from heaven and a woman.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Could it be──"<br class="calibre4" />
"It depicts the curse of the "Chain of Darkness." I carried here that mural I found two years ago in an ancient ruin."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And, the footsteps were approaching.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This voice was──.<br class="calibre4" />
I throbbed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I couldn't forget it.<br class="calibre4" />
It absolutely could not be forgotten.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I had always been taught magic by this person.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I wanted to be strong enough to protect Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
With that feeling in mind, I studied under this person.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Although strict, he was a respectable teacher who sometimes showed kindness.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But everything──had become past.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"As I thought, you're... Chrome"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A man with long bluish-black hair was standing behind the door.<br class="calibre4" />
His sharp eyes gazed straight at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's been a while, Valery."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I met my former teacher for the first time in these two years.<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
"Why you're alive, Chrome"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery looked at me with a stern look.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What is that, your disciple was still alive, so shouldn't you be more pleased?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I asked with irony.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...Hnn, my disciple you said? Your talent is just an average. So, it was not a loss to....sacrificed you for "Chain of Darkness"."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery snorted.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Thanks to that, the Hero Yuno, gained an enormous amount of [Light] power. Enough to slain the Demon King."<br class="calibre4" />
"Did you sacrificed me because I didn't have much talent?"<br class="calibre4" />
"It's mainly because I recommended you to be the sacrifice. It's boring to teach those who have no talent."<br class="calibre4" />
"Your disciples that I wiped out, they were so talented."<br class="calibre4" />
"...One might be as good as me at some point. Sadly."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery frowned.<br class="calibre4" />
I didn't know if they were his talented disciple or mere lovers.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Let's back to the topic. How could you be able to survive? How could you be able to utilize the power of [Darkness]?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery stared at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What reflected on his eyes was vigilance and fear.<br class="calibre4" />
And,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"A person who is sacrificed to "Chain of Darkness" should not be able to survive... Normally, that person would be swallowed by [Darkness] and disappeared. But, why── And even gained the power that I could not gain..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Probably jealousy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To me, who gained the mighty power of [Darkness]──.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>10 &#8211; Asking Questions</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"If you want to acquire information from someone, why don't you provide it first, Valery?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked at my former teacher──now a man who had degraded to be my hated revenge target.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Information from me?"<br class="calibre4" />
"First of all. It's about the way to remove the curse that had been subjected to Yulin."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yulin...? Ah, the subject 372 who escaped. Certainly, I have subjected her with [Darkness Pheromone]."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's gaze turned to Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Why you care about such a little girl?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Answer now."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I urged him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I keep all my research records about [Darkness Pheromone] in Orb numbered 372──the same number as that girl. Just bring it if you need it."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery pointed to the shelf on the right side of the room.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If it can get your [Darkness], I'm not worried about other research."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His eyes shone brightly.<br class="calibre4" />
Two years ago, he was a man who was keen on the search for magic, but he didn't have such sharp eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Was it meant that his passion had increased over the last two years.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Or──?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Darkness]──It's the ultimate tier in magic. What I've explored for more than 40 years and still can't get. What I can't reach yet. My biggest goal──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery told feverishly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Now, Tell me, Chrome. How did you can acquire [Darkness]?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Wait. I have another question."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His knowledge was valuable.<br class="calibre4" />
Before I finish my revenge, I had to get enough information.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Darkness] is──What actually is it?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I still didn't fully understand about this power dwelled in me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As I knew little about [Subordinate] relations until I met Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
There might be other information I didn't know yet.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Originally, that [Darkness], which would be the most important source of information, was a caprice.<br class="calibre4" />
Even if I asked a question, the answer not always be given.<br class="calibre4" />
So, it was a good idea to ask Valery about this.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
My revenge was still far.<br class="calibre4" />
Among them, there was Yuno who had the power of [Light].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If I didn't hone my power more──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"……Hmm"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery growled small.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I haven't completely clarified it. And I'm still researching it. So, I'll talk on that premise."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery put it as the preface and started to talk.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“Once upon all──there was a civilization in this world that was different from now”<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
Remuscelia.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was a prehistoric civilization that was flourished prosperous millions of years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
It seemed that at that time had much more advanced magic technology than now, and was much more prosperous than now.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, it was destroyed overnight by a mysterious disaster called "Great Disaster".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The magic we were using was the excavation and arrangement of the techniques developed by that prehistoric civilization.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Because the magic of prehistoric civilization was almost too advanced to be used.<br class="calibre4" />
It was used after being weakened and adjusted for modern people by reducing the output etc.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery had been studying that civilization all the time, I also knew<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I didn't only know by rumor, there was a strong theory that prehistoric civilization itself was just a kind of legend or fairy tale.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery was enthusiastic about his research.<br class="calibre4" />
Well, at that time there was a fierce battle with the Demon King Army, so he couldn't concentrate on the research.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Slightly before we parted──I discovered an ancient ruin. What was written there was a forbidden curse called the [Chain of Darkness]."<br class="calibre4" />
"Ancient ruin..."<br class="calibre4" />
"In other words, it was the ancient persons who have developed the [Chain of Darkness] spell, because they have much more knowledge about [Darkness] and [Light] than we have."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
According to Valery's explanation──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The forbidden cursed "Chain of Darkness" first created [Darkness] from the person who was sacrificed.<br class="calibre4" />
[Light] appeared in response to the [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
By giving the [Light] that appeared to the target person, that person gained tremendous power.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Simply put, that was it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In short, I was chosen as a sacrifice to give the target person──Yuno, the hero with the holy attribute──the power of [Light].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was also calculated that Irina showed the sight of visiting Yuno the day before.<br class="calibre4" />
It was to fuel my anger and sadness.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The greater the "negative emotions", the stronger the sacrifice would be.<br class="calibre4" />
The stronger the [Darkness] that was born, the stronger the [Light] that was born in response.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The reason I chose you as a sacrifice was──because I thought that the existences such as lover and best friend were easy and suitable to be used as triggers to generate negative emotions."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery said.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"First and foremost, your spirit was the purest in the party. It's the result of my spiritual measurement magic in advance. The more pure and clean the heart is, the more it gets trampled. It is easier to produce deep [Darkness]──."<br class="calibre4" />
"I lose my magical power, but why did my body deteriorate as well?"<br class="calibre4" />
"All the magical powers of those who have been selected as "sacrifice" are absorbed and become the energy source for [Darkness]. The body's deteriorating is the side effect of losing all magical power at once."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery answered my question,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"At the back of this room, there is a device that removes all the magical power from the subject. I tried to reproduce the "Chain of Darkness" simply by using it──but, it was completely useless. Like you, the subject's physical ability has significantly deteriorated."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And, Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Well, put that aside. It seems that what matters is not the magnitude of magical power, but the size of the sacrifice's "negative emotion"."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With a smile on his face, Valery continued the explanation.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Even if I was his disciple, he had no feelings or emotions.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
..... Surely, though I didn't know.<br class="calibre4" />
For this guy, I was only as valuable as experimental material.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I have understood about the [Chain of Darkness]. So, what is [Darkness] or [Light] in the first place?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
My question moved to the point.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Honestly, just listening to it gave me to anger and hatred.<br class="calibre4" />
Two years ago, I was used just like a tool, and that disposed of memory revived vividly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Still──first of all, was to gather all pieces of information.<br class="calibre4" />

<p><strong>11 &#8211; Self-esteem</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"What is Valery-sama talking to them...? His voice is low and I cannot hear well..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha was silently watching from the shadows.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Once frightened by the terrifying power of the intruder, he escaped.<br class="calibre4" />
However, it was not possible to abandon his beloved Valery and run away.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If he was fighting against those intruders, he had to help──.<br class="calibre4" />
He came back with that feeling.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
From another entrance, entered the Sage's Compartment, hiding himself in the myriad of shelves on the right side of the room.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
(Aah, Valery-sama...)<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha dyes his cheeks hot and looked at his beloved master.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As expected, unlike Mikha and the other disciples, Valery was calm in the face of intruders.<br class="calibre4" />
Without trembling of fear, without being pressured, full of dignity.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
(The enemy has terrible abilities... but Valery-sama will surely manage...)<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
One of the world's greatest wizards, a member of the Hero Party who defeated the Demon King.<br class="calibre4" />
Valery also created "The True Hero's Holy Sword Ark Weiss" a mysterious weapon possessed by the hero Yuno.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He longed for.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Intensely.<br class="calibre4" />
Vividly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To his strength.<br class="calibre4" />
To his knowledge.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He wanted to become a wizard like Valery one day.<br class="calibre4" />
As he was studying under him, his admiration became like a love.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
So when Valery invited him to bed, he didn't hate or feel humiliated at all.<br class="calibre4" />
There was only the joy of his admiration.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He tried to grow his hair become longer than he used to and got closer to what he liked.<br class="calibre4" />
He was now more confident that he was the most favored by him than the other disciples.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Appearance, inner appearance, and even the bed skill──.<br class="calibre4" />
Mikha thought of Valery and continued to polish all of it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Aah, Valery-sama... Please show me. The way you will use to beat those irreverent intruders."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He had lost in fear and ran away, but Valery was fine.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was sure he would beat those enemies.<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
[Darkness] was, what actually it meant──<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To my question, Valery quieted for a while,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm still researching it. I haven't got a definite answer. I've been investigating the ruins of the prehistoric civilization Remuscelia, who were much more familiar with [Darkness] and [Light] than we were..."<br class="calibre4" />
"Then, as far as you know"<br class="calibre4" />
"In a nutshell, it's something with huge energy that sleeps in a space different from this world."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery answered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Is it just energy? Is it a super existence with some kind of will? It has not been identified yet..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Different space?<br class="calibre4" />
A huge amount of energy that sleeps there?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Both were stories I heard for the first time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Obviously, because I found it myself."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery smiled with a good smile, as if read my mind.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The power of Magic is only eliciting a part of the power of [Darkness] and [Light] after all, or maybe the embodiment of the existence of god and devil ... I cannot say for sure, though. "<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was a grand story.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I have been studying [Darkness]. [Light] can only be manipulated by the people with "sacred attributes" like a hero. However, if it is [Darkness]──it can be obtained by a magician such as me. Theoretically."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery opened his hands with a grand gesture.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Manifested, [Commandment of Remuscelia]──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The wall behind him split left and right.<br class="calibre4" />
What appeared was a magic formation colored in black and gold.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Now, I'll acquire it. Your [Darkness]──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The next moment, a black lightning bolt was emitted from the magic circle.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kuh...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The lightning was entwining my whole body.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
My whole body was heavy...!<br class="calibre4" />
It was such a shock that my weak body was likely to fall apart.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kyaa...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea screamed next to me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
All "Attack against me", whether it was physical or magic, all dealt 9999 damage.<br class="calibre4" />
Curse, poison, paralysis... anything else that harmed me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But, this was──?<br class="calibre4" />
[Fixed Damage] didn't even work, Isn't it a kind of "Attack"?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The pains run on my limbs.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Fixed Damage] didn't work...?<br class="calibre4" />
Was the spell so powerful that the effect did not disappear after dealt 9999 damage?<br class="calibre4" />
Was there something like that?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No, perhaps──"<br class="calibre4" />
"[Commandment of Remuscelia]──A magical device that interferes with [Darkness] itself. It was excavated from ancient ruins."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery pointed to the magic circle behind him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Speaking of which, only Yulin who did not be affected.<br class="calibre4" />
It meant that it affected only me who had the power of [Darkness] and Shea who had been given that power.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"By watching my disciples' battle, I was able to grasp your skill. It may be a system of [Annihilation] or its evolution. The range is probably about 10 meters. That girl uses [Dissection]. I do not need to afraid if I keep a certain distance. If I use this device from a safe position, This is my victory.”<br class="calibre4" />
"What is, that device is..."<br class="calibre4" />
"It's to interfere the [Darkness], didn't I have told you? The source of your power is [Darkness]. If I shut it down, your skill will not be able to be activated. You are just a mere human──no, you've lost all magic power and physical strength due to "Chain of Darkness", you're just a scum!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery laughed triumphantly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"YOU...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea tried to run.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Acceleration]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her movement reached subsonic speed.<br class="calibre4" />
But, just before that,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Wind] [Prison]"<br class="calibre4" />
"Kyaa!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was bounced off by the wind magic cast by Valery, and furthermore, her limbs were bound and restrained in the air by an invisible energy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As expected, he was called the world's greatest wizard, and his magic activation speed was terrifying.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea didn't even be given time to use her skill.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"A girl who gained part of the power of [Darkness]──You'll become a good experimental material. Be quiet there."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Saying it, Valery this time stretched his hand toward me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Prison]"<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As with Shea, invisible energy bound my limbs.<br class="calibre4" />
My deteriorated limbs, like a dead trunk, squealed as if screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I couldn't move──<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“I still can interfere the [Darkness], but I can't take advantage of that power. However, eventually──by developing such a technique, I will take away your [Darkness]. "<br class="calibre4" />
"Valery...!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Hahahaha, I've given up at your talent, so I banished you two years ago──but when I'm looking at this, you were the most useful disciple for me! More than that younger brother of that child who is killed lightly!"<br class="calibre4" />
"What, aren't they important disciples for you?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I snarled at him while I was still restrained.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Funn, are you going to curse me in that situation?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's eyes shone.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Guu...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
My limbs became more restrained, and more pressured.<br class="calibre4" />
It was really hurt so that it might break at any moment.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──But I didn't really mind this kind of pain.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Compared to the pain of despair I received from you two years ago...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If you thought you would win this, it was a big mistake, Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
In the end, my victory was unwavering.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With confidence, I looked at Valery.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>12 &#8211; Black Scales</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome Walker. Why do you want to study under me?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
When I first met, Valery gazed at me wistfully.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I want to be strong. To become a man who fits her. I want to be able to protect her whenever she in danger."<br class="calibre4" />
"Who is she?"<br class="calibre4" />
"She's...my childhood friend"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While saying it, I got shy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To become a man who can protect the girl I love──Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Is it mediocre as a reason to aim for strength?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But for me, it was a reason worth risking my life for.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It seems that your talent is quite good. You can become, at least a court magician class, maybe?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery stared at me and nodded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I also like the fact that you have pure eyes than anyone else. You may eventually fulfill my wishes."<br class="calibre4" />
"Ee?"<br class="calibre4" />
"No, it's a long way off. I'll train you first. My training is tough, Chrome."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That was when he made me his apprentice.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Thank you, Sage-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Just Valery is good"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Valery... Shishou!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And I was trained by him, honed and refined my magic technique.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Four years later, at the age of seventeen, I gained the power to be certified as a wizard by the Shardy Kingdom.<br class="calibre4" />
I was chosen to be the member Hero Party and fought together.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery had always given me the right guidance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was an excellent master of magic.<br class="calibre4" />
In terms of personality, I didn't know his true nature at that time, so I respected him obediently.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I longed to become a wizard like him someday.<br class="calibre4" />
But──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shaking off my remembrance, I looked at him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[What, aren't they important disciples?]<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Why did I ask such a question?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6"><br class="calibre4" /></i>
<i class="calibre6">Does Valery really have a heart for his disciples?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">For me, and for his disciples nowadays.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">I wonder if somewhere in my heart I wanted this question answered.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It still remained in my heart, which currently filled with a desire for revenge──For him, <i class="calibre6">Is there a piece of admiration?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Important disciple?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's reply was a ridiculous mockery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"They're just disposable tools. It's more efficient to do magic research with more hands, rather than doing it alone. That's just why I raised them for."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As I listened to his reply, I felt that the core of my heart was getting cold.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...And in addition to that, they're also for your own sexual gratification, aren't they?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Hnn, don't meddle to other's hobbies."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery distorted the tip of his mouth and laughed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“There are plenty of replacements for my disciples. I am Sage Valery, a member of the Hero Party. Aspiring apprentices come in droves from all over the world. I'll just have to screen out those who have the looks and qualities I like.''<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This low-life, no matter where.<br class="calibre4" />
I stared at him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I respected him and sometimes longed for.<br class="calibre4" />
However, that kind of feeling──Maybe there was one piece left in my corner, the last admiration.<br class="calibre4" />
The last remained thing.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was completely gone now.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Come on, Chrome. With your [Darkness] in my hand──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The moment Valery looked at me and smirked.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A crack ran in a part of the black and gold magic circle behind him──"The Commandment of Remuscelia".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──I don't think that your effort such a degree can hold back my [Darkness] further, Valery."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was my turn to grin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<b class="calibre10"><span class="calibre22">[The master's despair and hatred are rising... The second regulation has been reached.]</span></b><br class="calibre4" />
<b class="calibre10"><span class="calibre22">[Ritual progress rate has reached 85%]</span></b><br class="calibre4" />
<b class="calibre10"><span class="calibre22">[The power of [Darkness] of the master increased by 666%]</span></b><br class="calibre4" />
<b class="calibre10"><span class="calibre22">[The manifestation of [Darkness] has changed from the basic form to the scale form]</span></b><br class="calibre4" />
<b class="calibre10"><span class="calibre22">[The interference binding wave against [Darkness] has been nullified.]</span></b><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The voice of [Darkness] echoed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I could feel it.<br class="calibre4" />
From the bottom of my body, the overflowing power sprung up.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Is it an action to overcome the interference of that ancient magic device?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Or did the face-to-face with Valery heighten my hatred even more?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The "power" that rose from the whole body spread around as energy that was shaped like jet black scales.<br class="calibre4" />
As soon as the scale touched the lightning emitted from the device,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Blitzz!<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And made a jarring noise and extinguished the lightning bolt.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No way── are you've nullified the effect of [Commandment]!? Impossib──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery groaned.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That has enough power to temporarily suppress even the [Darkness] of a Demon King class. There's no way it can be repelled.....''<br class="calibre4" />
"What happened? Is that your trump card?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I took a step.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
From the device, lightning bolts──the interference waves to [Darkness]──continuously emitted, which were all extinguished by jet black scales.<br class="calibre4" />
Then there was a roaring sound.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The device is──!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery was flustered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The huge magic circle behind him was emitting white smoke.<br class="calibre4" />
In the blink of an eye, it was engulfed in flames and "The Commandment of Remuscelia" burned down.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What the hell is your strength──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery stepped back with a horrified expression.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What the hell is..... your, hatred is....."<br class="calibre4" />
"The power I possessed, You guys who gave it"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Lifting the tip of my mouth, I smiled full of amusement.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“Hatred. Grudge. Anger. Sadness. Despair. Then──Desire for revenge.<br class="calibre4" />
All of those things made me stronger. My [Darkness] grow up──"<br class="calibre4" />
"[Darkness] grows infinitely.....you meant....!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I continued to walk with black scales expanded from my whole body.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His trump card was destroyed.<br class="calibre4" />
There was nothing to interfere with me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Now, it's the revenge time."<br class="calibre4" />

<p><strong>13 &#8211; That Bond Between Master and Disciple is an Illusion of a Distant Day</strong></p>

<br class="calibre4" />
"You said something interesting when you heard about [Darkness], Valery. Certainly, it was──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">[There is a device in the back of this room that extracts all the magical power from the subject.]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I remembered Valery's explanation.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It was a device to simply reproducing the [Chain of Darkness]──was I right?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I grinned.<br class="calibre4" />
In contrast, the blood drained from Valery's face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Yo, you bastard, could it be...."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He must have realized.<br class="calibre4" />
What am I planning on?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At first, I was just going to kill him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was Valery who directly applied the curse spell to me.<br class="calibre4" />
I hate, f*ckin' hate him, It couldn't be helped right.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I had been holding this grudge for the last two years.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, just kill him was not enough.<br class="calibre4" />
I want to make him suffer more and despair more.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To do that, I would take away the thing he cares most about.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, cut Valery's limbs tendons, immobilize him and then carry him to the device."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If I approached him up to 10 meters, I would just kill him without any entertainment.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Let's let Shea did it until the last minute.<br class="calibre4" />
However, I was the one who do the finishing touch.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Understood, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Nodding, Shea pulling out the sword.<br class="calibre4" />
Her eyes were terrifyingly sharp.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Is it because of the anger she's felt after coming here and watching their experiments?</i><br class="calibre4" />
Her mercilessness against an outrageous person might have become sharper than before.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Do, don't come clos──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery stepped backward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Thunderstorm]!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The high-tier lightning magic was released.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──Shea, don't move."<br class="calibre4" />
"Roger."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As per my instruction, Shea stopped on the spot.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shortly after, the lightning bolt approached her and disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
Even if it was an attack aimed at Shea, if it was an attack that involved me, I could damage it with skill effects and erased it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Damn...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery released the attack spells as if he was impatient.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Flames, ice, wind, invisible energy──.<br class="calibre4" />
Everything was blown away by my skills.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Go, Shea"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looking at the right timing, I ordered my [Subordinate] girl.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Acceleration]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea faded into a red flash.<br class="calibre4" />
The moment after he continuously released magic spells and there would be a cooldown to recharge his magic power before launched the next attack.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gaah...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea moved behind Valery at superfast speed and tore the tendons of Valery's both legs.<br class="calibre4" />
In addition, both his arms as well.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Guaaa, aaaaahhhhh..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With this, he would not be able to move.<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down at this writhing guy chillingly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"At this distance, Shea's sword is faster than your magic. If you do anything strange, she immediately cuts you off──understand?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I warned Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Yulin, do you want to participate in revenge?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I would just check with the girl behind me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...N, no, I am..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin shook her head from side to side.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She was looking at Valery with an expression full of pity.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Do you even have mercy on a person who has cursed you?</i><br class="calibre4" />
Maybe her personality not allowed her to do "revenge".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">No, she is a mere normal person and I'm the one who insane here, ain't I?</i><br class="calibre4" />
Who knows.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, I don't care about it now.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I only care about fulfilling my wishes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Then, Shea. Bring him to the back of the room."<br class="calibre4" />
"Understood, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded without hesitation.<br class="calibre4" />
She held Valery's arms and drag him to the front of the capsule, just as if carrying luggage.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At the back of the room was the device.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was a cylindrical magic device with a helmet connected by a tube──or, it looked like.<br class="calibre4" />
There was a manual on the side, so let's look over it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"……I see."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I lost my magical power, but I was a former wizard.<br class="calibre4" />
Regarding these magical devices, I had a rough idea after seeing them even if it was my first time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
According to the manual, if you put it on the head and activate the device, you will be able to extract the subject's magical power.<br class="calibre4" />
Just like two years ago, when I had been cursed by a forbidden spell, I lost all my magic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, this was a device just to "Steal the subject's magical power".<br class="calibre4" />
It didn't seem like it could give the power of [Darkness] like the [Chain of Darkness] that they put on me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, connect that one to the device"<br class="calibre4" />
"...! St, stop it, Chrome!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
However, because the tendons of his limbs were cut, he could only shake or twist his body.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea effortlessly held him down and put the helmet on his head.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I fiddled with the device and finished the settings.<br class="calibre4" />
After that, just push the activation switch.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Valery, are you ready?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Ugh... Stop... Stop it alreadyyy..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down at Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I can't let my intellect, my magical power end in this way! With my power, the magic civilization of humankind will develop more and more! So please, I beg you... Oh my disciple!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery exclaimed.<br class="calibre4" />
His obsession and attachment to magic were truly intense indeed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What the heck is that thing of the magic civilization of mankind will develop more. You a whimsical guy. You just want to satisfy your desire for knowledge. You've sent countless humans into hell for that. I'll end it now and for sure. I'll make you separate from the magic you explored in your life, forever."<br class="calibre4" />
"I, I don't want tooooooooo~!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He turned pale and screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery, who was always so calm, to show such a face.<br class="calibre4" />
Losing his power of magic──it was, after all, more painful than death for him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"F, forgive me... Chrome, Do not deprieve my magical power... I will do anything else you want! P, please forgive meeeeeeeeeee~!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery pleaded desperately.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Anything.....huh?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Y, yes, anything you order!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As he said, Valery laid his face down and began to lick the floor.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Perhaps he would have licked my shoes if possible, but unfortunately, he would die if we were too close.<br class="calibre4" />
Instead, he chose to lick the floor.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The man who was the best wizard in the world and my master, now was──<i class="calibre6">a miserable one</i>.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'll tell you, I've already got an audio recording orb from Irina. Its content is a confession of what the Hero Party did two years ago. If this spreads, your fame will fall apart to the ground."<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's face tightened.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Even if you lose your magical power, it still will be possible to take a disciple and carry out the research on your behalf. But when the Hero Party's sin comes to light, you will be chased as a sinner. No longer people wanting to be your disciples.''<br class="calibre4" />
"B, bastard..."<br class="calibre4" />
"This is the end. The path of magic you've spent your whole life exploring it. Now is cut off──by my very hands."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I slowly touched the switch as if to show off to him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No... don't doo...ooooo~..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's expression changed from anger and sadness to despair, and then to an emptiness that gave up everything.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Have you realized that no matter what you did or what you said, it was completely useless?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And I──<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I pushed the switch.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At the same time, a dazzling flash enveloped Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gu, aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh.....!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Was it physical pain or mental pain, I wondered.<br class="calibre4" />
Or, <i class="calibre6">maybe both</i>──Valery screamed out loud.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was a scream of despair, being robbed of his magical power, being robbed of everything he had pursued throughout his life.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>14 &#8211; End of Pursuit</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
Valery met "Magic" at the age of five.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Having a genius talent of magic, he thrived at that talent.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was only eight years old when he reached the level of a court magician in the Principality of Ryju.<br class="calibre4" />
Since then, he had continued to pursue and explore magic as if he were obsessed with it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was fascinated.<br class="calibre4" />
For him, magic was a mysterious power.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He wanted to explore more deeply than anyone else.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yes, more than any great wizard in history.<br class="calibre4" />
That was Valery's hope and dream.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And Valery did deep research on [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The origin of magic lied on [Darkness]──.<br class="calibre4" />
If he solved [Darkness] and made it his own, he would naturally reach the truth of magic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The first experiment was done two years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The forbidden spell, "Chain of Darkness".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He sacrificed his disciples at that time, and revealed [Darkness] to the world.<br class="calibre4" />
[Light] that appeared at the same time was given to the Hero Yuno.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He explained to the party, "The purpose of the forbidden spell is to strengthen the hero," but Valery's true purpose was to make [Darkness] appeared.<br class="calibre4" />
With that data, he immersed himself in deeper research.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Even after defeating the Demon King, he stayed in his own research facility near the border between the Principality of Lyju and the Kingdom of Ralpha, and devoted to it.<br class="calibre4" />
He repeated the human experimentations by kidnapping nearby residents one after another, and also took some excellent disciples to help with the research.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, the reason he took disciples was to satisfy his proclivities...<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
During the two years, the research had advanced dramatically.<br class="calibre4" />
Soon, He would unravel [Darkness]──the moment when his dream would come true was approaching.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And, his dream was shattered in an instant.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No way...this is...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery groaned with daze.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Just moments ago, The blazing magical power that overflowed from within him──He couldn't feel it at all.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Unbelievable.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was impossible.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It shouldn't happen.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Desperately, he tried to deny that nightmarish reality.<br class="calibre4" />
He tried his best to deny the desperate fact that this had happened to him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, he couldn't feel any magical power within himself.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It had disappeared.<br class="calibre4" />
The magic that Valery had been spare his life pursuing for──its origin.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His magical power that was indispensable for conducting magic research.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't f*ckin kidding me...! I'm so close to making my dream come true... What the hell is this?! Chrome, you... what did you do! My magical power...……my dream……give me baaaaaaaaaa~ck!"<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't f*ckin kidding me...! I'm so close to making my dream come true... What the hell is this?! Chrome, you... what did you do! My magical power...……my dream……give me baaaaaaaaaa~ck!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Ah, that's right.<br class="calibre4" />
I was really want to hear that voice of you....<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Two years ago, anger, sadness, loss, and despair had I experienced.<br class="calibre4" />
It was a different shape, but you were now──probably enjoying the same thing.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"How it is, Valerie?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down at my former teacher and laughed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"How does it feel to have your precious things unreasonably trampled and robbed?"<br class="calibre4" />
"YOOOOOOOOUUUUUU...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Red tears flowed from Valery's eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
Bloody tears.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"By a small fry like you, the dream that should leave my name in history is......AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That wailing became an inarticulate scream, then a strangled scream, then a ragged breath.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery should know well.<br class="calibre4" />
What had been lost will never return.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His magical power will never return.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Your lifelong pursuit of magic has come to the end."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was fun.<br class="calibre4" />
From the bottom of my heart, a dos black pleasure welled up.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
'You've lost the thing you cherished most, and your life's goals and purpose have been destroyed... You will live as you are now. You can live your life the way it is now, with despair."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The rest was──that's right, let's suppose he's sealed up there.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He would not die, so that he could live a life with pain in his body and mind.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, can I ask you for another?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I turned to my [Subordinate] girl.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Finally, the finisher.<br class="calibre4" />



<p><strong>14 &#8211; Conclusion and Turning Point</strong></p>



<br class="calibre4" />
In this room──Black Crystal Pillars stood on the left side of the Sage Compartment.<br class="calibre4" />
These were the magic tools that Valery's test subject was trapped in and continued to be inflicted with pain.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Most of them destroyed with Shea's [Dissection] when freeing the subjects.<br class="calibre4" />
But some crystals that were vacant remain.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"For the precious our former teacher and disciple relationship. I'll prepare a wonderful life for you."<br class="calibre4" />
"Wh, wha...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down at the quizzical Valery with a smile.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You'll live in the crystal while feeling the despair of losing your magical power, and in eternal pain as well."<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery raised an inaudible voice with a shocked face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Losing his magical power would be unbearable for him.<br class="calibre4" />
However, it was not impossible to use someone with magical abilities and continued the research.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If I revealed Irina's voice orb to the world, his fame would ruin, but that didn't mean that no one will follow him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
So, let's seal him there.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Reading the crystal's manual, it seemed to be also a life support device.<br class="calibre4" />
Apparently, it could last for five years without replenishment.<br class="calibre4" />
As expected of something made by Valery, it had high performance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I could lock him up without worrying about him will die so easily.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Rejoice. Every five years I'll visit here to replenish the crystal with life-sustaining energy. In this, you can live to the end of your life, Valery."<br class="calibre4" />
"YOU... YOUUU..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery's face turned red with anger and became pale due to the loss of blood.<br class="calibre4" />
His complexion changed, what a busy guy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, I guessed it was a natural reaction considering his future life.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, help me again. Just like I said, lock Valery inside the crystal."<br class="calibre4" />
"Understood, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded reverently.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In fact, if I got any closer than ten meters to Valery, he would be killed.<br class="calibre4" />
It was helpful that she was here.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama... I would like to ask you one thing."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea asked me,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"...Are you really okay with this?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Maybe because he was my former teacher? Don't worry about it. I do what I should do. Accomplish what I had to accomplish. That's it."<br class="calibre4" />
"...for asking you something so unnecessary. I apologize."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea bowed deeply.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Stop it! I'm done! What more are you going to do to me... Stop iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii~t!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery screamed with a horrified expression on his face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"H, hey, you're my cute disciple. Two years ago, there was a little unfortunate event... But I still think of you as an important disciple. You owe me a debt of gratitude, don't you? I was the one who taught you magic from scratch. Right? please reconsider it, oh my disciple, I beg you...th, that's right. The magic power you've been lost. Let's study how to restore it. I and you surely can figure──"<br class="calibre4" />
"Do it, Shea"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I didn't want to hear any unsightly excuses anymore.<br class="calibre4" />
So, I turned my back and walked to the crystal control unit at the end of the room.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Meanwhile, Shea carried Valery's body.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No! NOOO!! Please forgive me! Please help meeeeeeeeeeee! I beg yooooooouuuuuuuuuuuu!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That man whose limbs had been cut could not do anything but only twist and cry.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I went to the controller and turned back.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea had put Valery in the crystal.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Bye-bye, Master... I'll stop by in a few years to replenish the energy, so we'll meet again at that time."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This was the last time I called him "Master".<br class="calibre4" />
This also completely cut off our master-disciple relationship.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I did not hesitate to press the activation switch on the crystal controller.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......................."<br class="calibre4" />

<br class="calibre4" />
A scream of mixed anger, grief, pain, and despair echoed through the air.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I kept you waiting, Yulin. The next is doing your business."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I turned my back to Crystal and told Yulin.<br class="calibre4" />
I could hear agony and screams from behind me without pause, but it didn't matter anymore.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Let's looking for a method of dispel the [Darkness Pheromone]."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Among the orbs that contained his research achievements, there was also one that related to the curse on her── [Darkness Pheromone].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Surely Valery said it was the 372nd orb.<br class="calibre4" />
First of all, if we brought it back and studied it, we might find out how to dispel Yulin's curse.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We proceeded to the shelf on the right side of the room.<br class="calibre4" />
Orbs were lined up there.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama, this is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea pointed to the far right edge of the shelf.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Yulin's Orb?"<br class="calibre4" />
"No, it's different. That..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
On the shelves was written "00──Forbidden Spell - Chain of Darkness".<br class="calibre4" />
Was it a recording orb that contained the results of the research of the Forbidden Spell applied to me?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If I analyze it, I might be able to learn more about [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
I might be able to gain knowledge in the coming battle against Yuno.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"But there seems to be no orb...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yulin said.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Indeed, the crucial orb was nowhere to be found.<br class="calibre4" />
All orbs were in order from number 01, but only number 00 was missing.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What's the meaning of this──"<br class="calibre4" />
"Maybe someone has stolen it.....?"<br class="calibre4" />

Shea muttered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Stolen……?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Who did it──<br class="calibre4" />
I raised my eyebrows, then I noticed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There were a few characteristic red hairs that had fallen on the floor.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Maybe it was him.<br class="calibre4" />
Among Valery's seven disciples we fought before coming here.<br class="calibre4" />
Only one boy who managed to escape.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I didn't chase him because my objective was to get revenge on Valery.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If I wasn't wrong, he was Mikha.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What does he plan to do by stealing the research results of "Chain of Darkness"──<br class="calibre4" />

<p><strong>16 &#8211; The Hero and the Swordswoman 1</strong></p>

<div class="calibre4">One of the thirteen former Demon King executives, and a high-ranking demon race that currently led the remnants of the Demon King's army──the "Blue Demonic Dragon" Lagios.</div><div class="calibre4">It was only yesterday that they found out that his base was a castle at the southern end of the Luphus Empire.</div><div class="calibre4">Yuno was advancing inside the castle along with one member of the Hero party, the unrivaled swordswoman, Fara.</div><div class="calibre4">The gatekeepers and the castle guards were not enemies in front of his [Arkweiss, the Holy Sword of the True Hero].</div><div class="calibre4">He cut them down all with a single blow and pushed forward to the top floor.</div><div class="calibre4">"At this rate, it looks like I won't have a chance to do anything................... I thought I could swing my arm for the first time after a while."</div><div class="calibre4">Fara, who accompanied him, murmured as if she unsatisfied.</div><div class="calibre4">She was a brown-skinned beauty with silvery-white hair in a ponytail.</div><div class="calibre4">Her age was twenty-three.</div><div class="calibre4">Her mature, glamorous body was clad in a sensational armor designed almost like a bikini swimsuit.</div><div class="calibre4">She was the inheritor of the "Flame King's Red Lotus Blade", an ancient and mysterious swordsmanship style, and also was the most skilled swordsman in the party.</div><div class="calibre4">She was a genuine warrior who did not hesitate to profess that fighting was her life.</div><div class="calibre4">"No, we don't know what kind of surprise we'll get, and the power of the holy sword isn't infinite. So, I'll count on you when the time comes, Fara-san."</div><div class="calibre4">"I would have liked to fight with the whole party anyway, though."</div><div class="calibre4">A sad smile appeared on Fara's mouth as she answered.</div><div class="calibre4">The Warrior, Riot, who was a member of the Hero party, had been attacked by someone the other day and died an unnatural death.</div><div class="calibre4">That wasn't all.</div><div class="calibre4">The Saintess, Irina was attacked by a thug and was missing.</div><div class="calibre4">Furthermore, it seemed that the Sage, Valery, had also been unreachable for several days.</div><div class="calibre4">"Irina...."</div><div class="calibre4">Yuno mumbled the name of the woman who was the most important to him.</div><div class="calibre4">Until yesterday, he had desperately joined the search for the Saintess' whereabout.</div><div class="calibre4">But he had come here after he had been cut off from the search team in a desperate attempt to defeat Lagios.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">(Please be safe, Irina.)</i></div><div class="calibre4">He recalled for of that beautiful figure, a pure saintess.</div><div class="calibre4">Just the other day, the white naked body of her that he embraced in his bedroom, the beauty that plunged him in deep pleasure, and the sweet moaning voice of her──all come to his mind.</div><div class="calibre4">The existence of Irina was truly a treasure for Yuno, who had never have any relationship with a woman until becoming a hero.</div><div class="calibre4">He drowned in the pleasures of her body he'd never known before, and he ravished Irina's soft peach almost every day.</div><div class="calibre4">Originally, Irina was the lover of her best friend, Chrome.</div><div class="calibre4">As their journey against the Demon King's army continued, his feelings for her grew to the point that he could not endure anymore.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">I want to take her away.</i></div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">I want to make her my own.</i></div><div class="calibre4">Those desires grew by the day.</div><div class="calibre4">Eventually, the opportunity came.</div><div class="calibre4">He received a consultation from Valery about the selection of the sacrifice for the [Chains of Darkness] and he chose Chrome.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">If only he disappears, Irina will be mine──</i>.</div><div class="calibre4">He felt guilty for cheating his best friend, but he couldn't resist the temptation to get Irina.</div><div class="calibre4">When he casually proposed it to Irina, he was surprised to find that she also had secret feelings for Yuno.</div><div class="calibre4">If that's the case, let's get rid of the interfering Chrome──and the selection of the sacrifice was decided on him.</div><div class="calibre4">And then the forbidden spell was executed and Yuno acquired the mighty power of [Light].</div><div class="calibre4">At the same time, he also obtained his beloved Irina, whom he had been longing for.</div><div class="calibre4">The strongest power and a beloved lover.</div><div class="calibre4">With those two he had acquired, he felt that his life had reached its peak.</div><div class="calibre4">The days of bliss had begun.</div><div class="calibre4">That was──there was no way I could let it end.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">(When this battle is over, I will definitely come back to look for you, Irina.)</i></div><div class="calibre4">With renewed determination, Yuno proceeded to the top floor with Fara.</div><div class="calibre4">"So you have come here, Hero."</div><div class="calibre4">A huge dragon stood on the top floor of the castle.</div><div class="calibre4">"Prepare yourself, Lagios. We cannot allow you demons to tainted this peaceful world."</div><div class="calibre4">Yuno held his holy sword and raised his voice.</div><div class="calibre4">Lagios was an ancient dragon that was touted as the strongest of the thirteen leaders of the Demon King's Army.</div><div class="calibre4">His huge body, covered in blue scales, was covered in flames of magical power and would burn and melt all who came near.</div><div class="calibre4">Yuno used the blessing of the holy sword to counteract the flames, and Fara used her battle prana to block the flames.</div><div class="calibre4">"The strongest executive in the Demon King's army, huh? Probably you're an opponent that seems to have some power."</div><div class="calibre4">Fara murmured in a passionated tone.</div><div class="calibre4">An oddly lustrous atmosphere was in the air.</div><div class="calibre4">It was said──when dealing with a fierce opponent, Fara would feel a strong sexual excitement.</div><div class="calibre4">Yuno couldn't help but swallow raw at the intense pheromones emitted by the usually spirited and vivacious female warrior.</div><div class="calibre4">Naturally, his gaze was drawn to her sensual body.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">(I, I shouldn't. What I am thinking on the battlefield........)</i></div><div class="calibre4">Aware of his raised lust, Yuno panicked and hurriedly regained his rationality.</div><div class="calibre4">In the first place, he already had a partner named Irina........</div><div class="calibre4">"Demon King Vilgarodomus-sama is already gone. But I'll inherit that person's will. Then I will organize a new Demon King's army and this time I will make the human world belong to our demon race!"</div><div class="calibre4">Lagios exclaimed cheerfully.</div><div class="calibre4">"Funny! I won't let you do it!"</div><div class="calibre4">As soon as she said it, Fara jumped out.</div><div class="calibre4">The fighting spirit clad in her entire body drew a pale trail and pushed forward into the giant blue dragon.</div><div class="calibre4">"Taste this!"</div><div class="calibre4">Lagios exhaled a bluish breath from his mouth.</div><div class="calibre4">The breath clashed with the fighting spirit that flooded out from Fara's entire body.</div><div class="calibre4">Dazzling sparks popped over and over.</div><div class="calibre4">"Kyaaa...!"</div><div class="calibre4">Fara was blown away by the dragon breath.</div><div class="calibre4">"To be able to overcome my fighting spirit... Ku, ugh...."</div><div class="calibre4">The swordswoman was struck on the ground and let out a bitter cry.</div>

<div class="calibre4">"Hnnn, to offset my breath to that extent.......as expected of a member of the hero party."</div><div class="calibre4">Answer Lagios.</div><div class="calibre4">"However, I can't prevent it anymore."</div><div class="calibre4">Fara's armor was almost shattered, and her limbs, which had been nearly half-naked before, were now nearly naked.</div><div class="calibre4">Her rich brown bre*sts, attractive waist, sensual thighs──.</div><div class="calibre4">The mature body line made Yuno more and more fascinated.</div><div class="calibre4">"What happened, hero. Will you not fight?"</div><div class="calibre4">Lagios looked at me.</div><div class="calibre4">"...! Now it's my turn."</div><div class="calibre4">Hurriedly regaining consciousness, Yuno readied his holy sword.</div><div class="calibre4">"Fara, you stay back."</div><div class="calibre4">"──My bad. Sorry, I'll leave the rest to you."</div><div class="calibre4">The swordswoman honestly acknowledged the difference in strength between herself and her opponent and backed down.</div><div class="calibre4">Looking at the sensational figure from the side, Yuno cleared his throat again.</div><div class="calibre4">An evil thought comes to a corner of his mind.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">If something were to happen to Irina──.</i></div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">Fara probably will be worthy of being my new lover.</i></div><div class="calibre4">──Zugun!</div><div class="calibre4">The "True Heroic Sacred Sword Arkweiss" in his hand suddenly struck a hot pulse.</div>

<p><strong>17 &#8211; The Hero and the Swordswoman 2</strong></p>

<div class="calibre4">Hot──.</div><div class="calibre4">The sword held by Yuno was pulsing violently.</div><div class="calibre4">A torrent of white, shining energy overflowed from the tip of the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre4">Gradually........</div><div class="calibre4">Then the space in front of him distorted greatly.</div><div class="calibre4">Beyond that──he could see what looked like a black stain.</div><div class="calibre4">"What is──that."</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">[It seems that the door of the [Black Phase &lt;Qliphoth&gt;] is about to open. It's even interfering with me.]</i></div><div class="calibre4">A voice came from the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre4">No, to be precise, it was like the will that dwelling in the holy sword──.</div><div class="calibre4">It was simply called [Light].</div><div class="calibre4">"Qli.....photh?"</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">[It's a sign that the power of [Darkness] has been maximized somewhere.]</i></div><div class="calibre4">"The power... of [Darkness]."</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">[This may be a threat incomparable to the remnants of the Demon King's Army.

Give me great power!"</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">[Roger that, Master.]</i></div><div class="calibre4">As always, the voice of the Holy Sword was reliable.</div><div class="calibre4">With this sword, he would not be defeated by any enemy in the world.</div><div class="calibre4">Even the most powerful Demon King Vilgarodomus was defeated.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">Compared to that, no matter how powerful Lagios is──</i>.</div><div class="calibre4">"I will win."</div><div class="calibre4">A radiance overflowing from the holy sword enveloped Yuno's entire body.</div><div class="calibre4">A pattern that looked like a spade appeared on his forehead.</div><div class="calibre4">It was the crest of the Hero of [Light].</div><div class="calibre4">At the same time, his body was fully filled with power.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">We can win──</i>.</div><div class="calibre4">No matter what kind of enemy, I can crush them with a single blow.</div><div class="calibre4">Such overwhelming confidence rose.</div><div class="calibre4">"Haaaaaa!"</div><div class="calibre4">With wrapped in a golden aura, Yuno kicked the ground.</div><div class="calibre4">In an instant, he leaped up to the top of Lagios' head.</div><div class="calibre4">"F, fast──!"</div><div class="calibre4">Even Lagios was surprised.</div><div class="calibre4">"Oooooooooooooooooo!"</div><div class="calibre4">Filled with a fighting spirit, a golden slash was unleashed.</div><div class="calibre4">"Ga.........ha......."</div><div class="calibre4">The forehead was deeply slashed, and then, that giant body of the blue dragon collapsed.</div><div class="calibre4">"Pheeewww."</div><div class="calibre4">Yuno exhaled heavily and sheathed his holy sword on his back.</div><div class="calibre4">The golden aura that had released and the strength gradually faded from his body.</div><div class="calibre4">"──Not yet!"</div><div class="calibre4">Fara shouted out a warning.</div><div class="calibre4">"Eh...?"</div><div class="calibre4">Turning around, Yuno's vision reflected the giant body of Lagios, who had stood up.</div><div class="calibre4">It seemed that the demonic dragon was still alive even after receiving the strike just now.</div><div class="calibre4">It was a tremendous life force.</div><div class="calibre4">No──.</div><div class="calibre4">"No way, that was──[Barrier Crest]!?"</div><div class="calibre4">There was something shiny on Lagios' forehead.</div><div class="calibre4">That was the [Barrier Crest].</div><div class="calibre4">It is a treasure trove that nullified all kinds of [Abnormal State] such as poison and paralysis, and also protected the user until received a cumulative 30000 damage from physical and magical.</div><div class="calibre4">In the past, when they fought against the Demon King, Yuno and the others were able to survive the onslaught with this treasure.</div><div class="calibre4">It seemed that the demonic dragon had that treasure embedded in his forehead.</div><div class="calibre4">Even though it was the Holy Sword Arkweiss, its single strike did about 6000 damage.</div><div class="calibre4">It was impossible to defeat the [Barrier Crest] in a single strike.</div><div class="calibre4">"Kukuku, without this treasure, I would have been beaten by you. That's pretty impressive, Hero."</div><div class="calibre4">Lagios laughed.</div><div class="calibre4">"Damn...!"</div><div class="calibre4">The enemy was already in a firing stance for the next Dragon Breath.</div><div class="calibre4">The other party, in contrast, was in a rigid state immediately after the attack.</div><div class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">This
