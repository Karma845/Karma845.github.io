<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Darkness and Demon King</h3>

<p><strong>1 &#8211; Reunion</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">I was confronting Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">Margo Lascada, the hero knight of the Luphus Empire.</div><div class="calibre5">Even now, two years later, he didn't seem to change.</div><div class="calibre5">He didn't grow like Riot, didn't prοstιtutε to multiple people for power like Irina, and didn't repeat outrageous magical experiments like Valery.</div><div class="calibre5">As a hero, he seemed to continue to fight the remnants of the Demon King's army.</div><div class="calibre5">But...... it's just a facade.</div><div class="calibre5">If he was a true hero, he would have opposed sacrificing me two years ago.</div><div class="calibre5">I will never forget the expression of relief and joy that he had when I was sacrificed.</div><div class="calibre5">And then──Sure enough, he was working with the demons.</div><div class="calibre5">"What is your aim, Margo?"</div><div class="calibre5">I kept a distance of at least 10 meters so that I wouldn't suddenly wipe him out with [Fixed Damage].</div><div class="calibre5">"Shea, Yulin. Stop him if he's about to enter my skill range. I don't want to kill him easily."</div><div class="calibre5">"Understood."</div><div class="calibre5">"Leave it to me"</div><div class="calibre5">My [Subordination] girls nodded reverently.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea held her magic sword with [Dissection] skill, and Yulin drifted the aura of a demon from her whole body.</div><div class="calibre5">They're already in a battle-ready stance.</div><div class="calibre5">"Why are you alive, Chrome"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo stepped back with a pale face.</div><div class="calibre5">"Moreover, your hair is...... also your limbs are so skinny......"</div><div class="calibre5">"You're surprised at the change in my appearance? My hatred, my grudges against you guys──I could never forget it and kept holding it. That's how I survive."</div><div class="calibre5">I smirked.</div><div class="calibre5">"Why does the power of [Darkness] belong to......? It can't be, the effect of that ritual──"</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm here the first who ask the question."</div><div class="calibre5">I released the black chain.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ugh!? I, can't move."</div><div class="calibre5">It bound Margo's entire body.</div><div class="calibre5">"But if it's my treasure sword──"</div><div class="calibre5">"I won't let you use it."</div><div class="calibre5">As he tried to reach for the sword on his waist, I tightened the chains.</div><div class="calibre5">"U......Guuuhh......"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo frowned in pain.</div><div class="calibre5">His sword, "The 77-forms Gale Thunder King Sword", was a first-class magic weapon.</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't think it can break my black chain, but it's better not to let him use it.</div><div class="calibre5">"Why are you with the demons, The Hero Knight?"</div><div class="calibre5">I lifted the edge of my mouth sarcastically.</div><div class="calibre5">"Th-that is......"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo clammed up.</div><div class="calibre5">"... Yuno has become too strong. He has power enough to defeat even that Demon Lord Vilgarodomus...... but it's too much power for humans. Eventually, he will run amok and then will destroy the world──That's what I heard."</div><div class="calibre5">"Heard? From whom?"</div><div class="calibre5">"──from God."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo told solemnly.</div><div class="calibre5">"What?"</div><div class="calibre5">"To be precise, the source of [Light] that Yuno has is── [Nirvana]"</div><div class="calibre5">"[Nirvana]...... you said?"</div><div class="calibre5">This is the first time I've heard that name, and I raised my eyebrows.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Do you know it, Rakshasa?"</div><div class="calibre5">Then I called Rakshasa.</div><div class="calibre5">[It is the opposite of [Abyss], which is the terminal of our [Darkness], Master.]</div><div class="calibre5">A beautiful woman in black appeared and explained.</div><div class="calibre5">"I dared to jump into the demon-side in order to stop Yuno from running amok."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo said in a dignified tone.</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't want to side with the demons, but my interests are aligned with theirs. That's why I'm working with them ──even if it means I have to face the stigma of being a knight."</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know how much I should believe him.</div><div class="calibre5">He probably didn't tell me the hundred percent truth.</div><div class="calibre5">There must be some lies mixed within.</div><div class="calibre5">But on the other hand, there are indications that he is speaking a mixture of truth and falsehood.</div><div class="calibre5">──Shall I let him for a while?</div><div class="calibre5">"I get it."</div><div class="calibre5">I withdraw the black chain to my hand and released Margo from restraining.</div><div class="calibre5">"Chrome-sama......?"</div><div class="calibre5">Shea and Yulin stared at me.</div><div class="calibre5">Raksasa was keeping a smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">"I've been asked to help the demons. If you're working with Frangulas and the others, there's no reason to fight you for the time being."</div><div class="calibre5">......Yes, for the time being.</div><div class="calibre5">I'll get my revenge eventually, but I'll postpone it for a little while.</div><div class="calibre5">When Franjulous invited me to his hideout,</div><div class="calibre5">She said, "I have some hints for you to further cultivate your powers".</div><div class="calibre5">I demanded her to show me the "hints" but she said it would take a few days to prepare.</div><div class="calibre5">......Is she planning to do something with?</div><div class="calibre5">Or is it really so?</div><div class="calibre5">Well, if she's up to something, I'll just wipe her out.</div><div class="calibre5">With [Fixed Damage], all of her.</div><div class="calibre5">"If I further cultivate my powers──will you be okay with that? What if I use that power to crush you?"</div><div class="calibre5">I asked Frangulas.</div><div class="calibre5">"You wouldn't do such a deceitful thing, would you? You were able to keep your reasoning from being consumed by the [Darkness] while kept deepening it──to do that, You have to have a very pure heart."</div><div class="calibre5">"Is that all your bases?"</div><div class="calibre5">"I have faith in your heart and soul."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangoulas smiled.</div><div class="calibre5">"Consistency. The danger. I even find it endearing."</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Are you, hitting on Chrome-sama?"</div><div class="calibre5">"...... Whenever there's an opportunity, there's always a flirt. You must never let your guard down."</div><div class="calibre5">I don't know why Shea and Yulin are glaring at me.</div><div class="calibre5">"This way, please. I'll guide you to the guest room."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas urged us with a lustrous smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre5">"We're all in the same room, huh......"</div><div class="calibre5">I muttered to myself as I was shown to the room.</div><div class="calibre5">Moreover, the bεd was large enough to sleep five people.</div><div class="calibre5">"If you'd like, I can prοvide you with a bεdmatε."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas smiled.</div><div class="calibre5">"Or perhaps──those two would like to take on that role?"</div><div class="calibre5">"B, b, b, b, b, b, b, b-bεdmatε!?"</div><div class="calibre5">Shea's voice trailed off.</div><div class="calibre5">"W-we...... are going to prεsεnt οur chastιtιes to Chrome-sama....... I knew that that time would come one day, and finally......"</div><div class="calibre5">Huft, Yulin sighed in annoyance.</div><div class="calibre5">No, wait.</div><div class="calibre5">"These two are just traveling companions. They are not such partners."</div><div class="calibre5">"If so, I shall get anοther wοman."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas said immediately.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll pass."</div><div class="calibre5">"Oh? Do you prefer men to women, Chrome-sama?"</div><div class="calibre5">"That's not what I meant."</div><div class="calibre5">I glared at Frangulas resentfully.</div>

<p><strong>2 &#8211; Encounter</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">"I don't mind in the same room. No, in order to protect Chrome-sama, I'd love to be in the same room......!"</div><div class="calibre5">For some reason, Shea was breathing hard and fidgeted.</div><div class="calibre5">Her cheeks were bright red as well.</div><div class="calibre5">She wrapped the tips of his red hair in a two-sided updo around his fingers and fiddled with them restlessly.</div><div class="calibre5">"S-so, if that's the case, I'll also......be by Chrome-sama's side as a [Subordinate]...... Ummm." <b class="calibre6"><i class="calibre8">(PTW/N: she has changed of referring him from "-san" to "-sama"??...... since when???)</i></b></div><div class="calibre5">Yulin told me next to Shea, wriggling in embarrassment.</div><div class="calibre5">She was also breathing strangely.</div><div class="calibre5">"We're all in the same room?"</div><div class="calibre5">I mumbled to myself.</div><div class="calibre5">......I don't think it's good for men and women who aren't lovers or couples to stay in the same room, and this is the headquarters of the demon army.</div><div class="calibre5">Strange thoughts should be thrown away.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Then let the three of us use this room."</div><div class="calibre5">"Understood. Then you don't need a fairy-tale, do you?"</div><div class="calibre5">No, let's not talk about the fairy tale anymore.</div><div class="calibre5">"If you want to go with a lot of people, you can always ask. I will assign you the best demonesses. But, if you wish, I myself can also──"</div><div class="calibre5">"No, thank you."</div><div class="calibre5">In fact, it's too dangerous to invite Frangulas to sleep.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mumumu...... She's a super beautiful woman, even though a demon, and she might be a strong enemy to be able to seduce Chrome-sama so straight."</div><div class="calibre5">"We must never be off-guard."</div><div class="calibre5">For some reason, Shea and Yulin looked at each other and had a strange fighting spirit.</div>
<br class="calibre5" />
<div class="calibre5">──So, now we were relaxing in the guest room.</div><div class="calibre5">It's been a while since I've spent time indoors like this.</div><div class="calibre5">And moreover, the room is as opulent as an aristocrat's.</div><div class="calibre5">"Wow, this one is beautiful....... Oh, this one's nice too~"</div><div class="calibre5">Shea was looking at the room's furnishings with great interest.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kyaaa, it's so fluffy~"</div><div class="calibre5">While Yulin, was lounging on the bed in the center of the room, enjoying herself.</div><div class="calibre5">I sat down on a chair and took a breath.</div><div class="calibre5">I don't have much energy like the two of them, so I rested quietly.</div><div class="calibre5">And</div><div class="calibre5">"You've been camping out all this time because of me. I'm sorry."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin bowed to me and Shea.</div><div class="calibre5">"You don't have to apologize. Besides, you didn't attract monsters anymore."</div><div class="calibre5">"Right right, after we leave here, we can stay at the inn. Yulin-chan."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea and I said to an apologetic Yulin.</div><div class="calibre5">"Thank you very much."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin smiled slyly.</div><div class="calibre5">"Please have a well rest now, Chrome-sama. I would protect you if anything happens.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea said to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"But, I'm sure your skills would basically prevent any harm, though......."</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah, [Fixed Damage] will protect me from everything. Instead, you are the one who should rest, Shea. You've been working so hard for so long."</div><div class="calibre5">"I...... would never be tired if I could be of help to you."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea told me, her cheeks turning red.</div><div class="calibre5">"Chrome-sama too, no matter how powerful your skill is, your body is not that strong. Please take a rest."</div><div class="calibre5">"...... You've been making out to each other for a while now, haven't you."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin murmured.</div><div class="calibre5">"The two of you seem to be in perfect harmony. I'm not sure what to make of it. I can even feel the sweet atmosphere of two lovers, fufu."</div><div class="calibre5">"......? N-no, I don't have that kind of relationship with Chrome-sama...... Umm, that is."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea turned redder and redder.</div><div class="calibre5">"......If so, I have a chance, then."</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea suddenly reverted to a straight face.</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin wriggled shyly.</div><div class="calibre5">"N-no, it's nothing......."</div><div class="calibre5">What's wrong with you two, from a while ago.</div>
<div class="calibre5">It was getting late, and we decided to go to bed.</div><div class="calibre5">As expected, sleeping in the same bed with Shea and Yulin would be a problem.</div><div class="calibre5">──I tried to sleep on the floor, but,</div><div class="calibre5">"No, you couldn't do that, Chrome-sama."</div><div class="calibre5">"That will hinder your recovery."</div><div class="calibre5">The two strongly insisted, and eventually, the three of us ended up sleeping in the same bed.</div><div class="calibre5">......I couldn't sleep.</div><div class="calibre5">Maybe it's a shock of the sudden change from staying outdoors to indoors.</div><div class="calibre5">Or is it because I'm in high?</div><div class="calibre5">Or is it that I'm uncharacteristically embarrassed to be in a situation where there are two beautiful girls on each of my sides?</div><div class="calibre5">Well, maybe it's a mixture of all of them.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea and Yulin were sleeping soundly, probably because they were exhausted.</div><div class="calibre5">I got off the bed quietly so as not to wake them up.</div><div class="calibre5">"Pheww......"</div><div class="calibre5">After all, the fatigue had been accumulated considerably.</div><div class="calibre5">I had skinny limbs, and my physical strength was far below the average for someone in their twenties.</div><div class="calibre5">I'd been traveling with such a body.</div><div class="calibre5">I killed Riot, turned Irina into a magical beast, and made Valery experience eternal pain──</div><div class="calibre5">[I see, I feel a deep [Darkness]...... that even has surpassed any superior demons...]</div><div class="calibre5">A voice echoed from somewhere.</div><div class="calibre5">I hurriedly looked around.</div><div class="calibre5">Rather than a "voice", it was more like it echoed directly in my head.</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly, my vision blurred and a silhouette resembling a black skull appeared.</div><div class="calibre5">"Who, the h*ll are you......?"</div><div class="calibre5">I was puzzled.</div><div class="calibre5">[It's the first time we've talked like this. Those who have reached the depths of [Darkness].]</div><div class="calibre5">The skull clacked its teeth and spoke.</div><div class="calibre5">The room is silent and still.</div><div class="calibre5">It was as if time itself had frozen over.</div><div class="calibre5">I looked to my left and right and saw that both Shea and Yulin were sleeping peacefully and soundly.</div><div class="calibre5">[I am Vilgarodomus.]</div><div class="calibre5">I gulped again at the skull's words.</div><div class="calibre5">[I am The Demon King who was once defeated by The Hero.]</div>

<p><strong>3 &#8211; Demon King Vilgarodomus</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">"Demon King......you say......?"</div><div class="calibre5">I stared at the skull in front of me in surprise.</div><div class="calibre5">The distance between me and the skull is about seven meters.</div><div class="calibre5">It's within the range of my skills, of course.</div><div class="calibre5">But the skull was standing there, perfectly still.</div><div class="calibre5">If it was not affected by [Fixed Damage]...... it meant that this guy didn't have any hostile or harmful intentions towards me.</div><div class="calibre5">Or──</div><div class="calibre5">I extended my right hand and released the black chain.</div><div class="calibre5">But as soon as the chain touched the skull, it faded away like a haze.</div><div class="calibre5">After a while, gathered and reformed a skull.</div><div class="calibre5">So this guy──isn't real?</div><div class="calibre5">[My body had already been destroyed. By that abominable hero Yuno.]</div><div class="calibre5">Said The Demon King.</div><div class="calibre5">[What you see here is the vestige. The craving for life that the Demon King Vilgalodomus left behind. Regret. Obsession. And──hope.]</div><div class="calibre5">"So, much like his vestige's consciousness......?"</div><div class="calibre5">[Pretty much it.]</div><div class="calibre5">The skull nodded in response to my question.</div><div class="calibre5">"So, what do you want from me? Demon King."</div><div class="calibre5">I did not let my guard down and moved my gaze to the bed.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea and Yulin hadn't seemed to wake up yet.</div><div class="calibre5">[Don't be so alert. I just want to talk to you.]</div><div class="calibre5">And, The Demon King.</div><div class="calibre5">[You are the one who encountered the abyss of [Darkness].──The one with the pitchest [darkness] in this world. Therefore, I would like to ask you for a favor.]</div><div class="calibre5">"Favor......?"</div><div class="calibre5">[Help me to reappear in this world.]</div><div class="calibre5">I glared at the skull in front of me.</div><div class="calibre5">In other words, what this guy's asking was──</div><div class="calibre5">"You want me to help you revive the Demon Lord?"</div><div class="calibre5">[The demon race is the existence of [Darkness] that spilled over from the [Abyss] and became deeply manifested in this world. The Demon King is the ultimate example of this. If you are endowed with a powerful [Darkness], then you can help me revive.]</div><div class="calibre5">The Demon King told it plainly.</div><div class="calibre5">The demon race was born from [Abyss]......!</div><div class="calibre5">I was surprised inwardly.</div><div class="calibre5">[I was struck by Hero's [Light] and lost a large amount of [Darkness] within my body. If I can make up for it, it's not impossible to materialize in this world again.]</div><div class="calibre5">The demon king proceeded with his words without hesitation.</div><div class="calibre5">"......I have no obligation to cooperate with."</div><div class="calibre5">I sniffled.</div><div class="calibre5">Who the h*ll would want to help revive the demon king?</div><div class="calibre5">[Indeed, you have no reason to. But there is an advantage.]</div><div class="calibre5">"What?"</div><div class="calibre5">[I'll grant you your wish.]</div><div class="calibre5">The skull's mouth rattled noisily.</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed to be laughing.</div><div class="calibre5">[I can give you this entire world.]</div><div class="calibre5">"That's a very typical offer from the Demon King."</div><div class="calibre5">I smiled back, the corners of my mouth distorted.</div><div class="calibre5">"I refuse."</div><div class="calibre5">[......Hmm.]</div><div class="calibre5">The demon king growled.</div><div class="calibre5">[Then how about I help you get your revenge?]</div><div class="calibre5">"Help me get my revenge......."</div><div class="calibre5">[Your target──Yuno the Brave, will eventually gain a mighty power. I'll give you the means to fight it.]</div><div class="calibre5">"A mighty power.......?</div><div class="calibre5">[[Light] gains more and more power as the host's "Willpower" strengthens. The source of this "Willpower" is desire.]</div><div class="calibre5">And Vilgalodomus.</div><div class="calibre5">[It can be paraphrased as craving or greed. The host and the people around the host are also affected by the [light] and their cravings are amplified. The light strengthens the host's will, and the strengthened host's will strengthens the light──and so the power increases. It's the warriors that are chosen by the light.]</div><div class="calibre5">"You mean that Yuno will become even stronger in the future?"</div><div class="calibre5">[You're still superior to him now. But in time, when the heroes grow in strength, you may be caught unawares. Yes, just as when he once defeated me. To the Hero who has awakened to the true [Light]──]</div><div class="calibre5">"Do I, have the power to counter that?"</div><div class="calibre5">In other words──it's a deal with the Demon King.</div><div class="calibre5">※</div><div class="calibre5">&lt;HAROLD's SIDE&gt;</div><div class="calibre5">Harold's head felt like it was covered with a thick haze.</div><div class="calibre5">His consciousness was not clear.</div><div class="calibre5">In his mind, he saw a bewitching woman in black.</div><div class="calibre5">The demon, Frangulas.</div><div class="calibre5">The bewitching vampire's true ancestor had stolen Harold's heart.</div><div class="calibre5">He pledged his absolute loyalty to her and became her servant.</div><div class="calibre5">From then, he fought for the demon race.</div><div class="calibre5">The holy sword in his hand, [Garlev] also be wielded to protect the demon race──to carry out Frangulas' orders.</div><div class="calibre5">*Gleam* ......!</div><div class="calibre5">Light suddenly flooded from the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">At the same time, an intense numbness ran through his body.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ugh...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......!"</div><div class="calibre5">The numbness was accompanied by pain, gradually awakening the stupefied consciousness.</div><div class="calibre5">"I ...... am ......?"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold shook his head lightly and looked around.</div><div class="calibre5">A room in a dark castle.</div><div class="calibre5">"Right, I'm pretty sure I fought an executive of the Demon King's army, and Frangulas put a...... charm on me......."</div><div class="calibre5">The memory came back to him clearly.</div><div class="calibre5">The blurry feeling in my head began to clear.</div><div class="calibre5">"D*mn, I was succumbing to a vampire to a vampire......."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold gritted his teeth.</div><div class="calibre5">It's the greatest humiliation for a hero to bend the knee in front of the demon, his enemy.</div><div class="calibre5">He'd never forgive her.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll pay you back double for this debt."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold slowly stood up.</div><div class="calibre5">Where are the others?</div><div class="calibre5">Should I search the castle first──</div><div class="calibre5">Harold left the room with the holy sword in his hand.</div><div class="calibre5">Thum, Thump......!</div><div class="calibre5">The holy sword held in his right hand was pulsating hotly──.</div>

<p><strong>4 &#8211; Hero Harold's Counterattack 1</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">Harold originally lived as a farmer in a remote area of the Lyju Principality.</div><div class="calibre5">Even though he was over 30 years old, he hadn't married, never got involved with other people, and devoted all his time working on the farm day in and day out.</div><div class="calibre5">The turning point in his life came two years ago.</div><div class="calibre5">Two years ago, the Demon King's army swept into the village, and many villagers were killed.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold himself was attacked by a demon and was in desperate need of help.</div><div class="calibre5">At that time, there was someone who spoke to him.</div><div class="calibre5">──Thou art the chosen h'ro, Harold.</div><div class="calibre5">──Taketh up thy sw'rd.</div><div class="calibre5">──Thee has't been given the holy sw'rd "garlev"</div><div class="calibre5">Light, wind, fire, rainbow, star, dragon, void──one of the seven attributes of the holy sword "Garlev".</div><div class="calibre5">There dwells the will of [Light].</div><div class="calibre5">Harold, who was given the holy sword, used its power to wipe out the demons.</div><div class="calibre5">And so began his battle as a hero.</div><div class="calibre5">On his journey of battle, he met four comrades.</div><div class="calibre5">Isabelle, a cool and beautiful spearwoman.</div><div class="calibre5">Joseph, a wizard boy who is the youngest among them and also a mood maker.</div><div class="calibre5">Irvine, a young archer who is cynical but kind-hearted at his core.</div><div class="calibre5">Rosa, a female monk with a sassy personality.</div><div class="calibre5">Together with their comrades, they spend their days fighting the Demon King's army.</div><div class="calibre5">It was painful, but it was also joyful.</div><div class="calibre5">It was because they recognized Harold as a friend.</div><div class="calibre5">Isabelle confided her feelings to him, and he fell in love with her.</div><div class="calibre5">For Harold, who had never been deeply involved with others in his life, the days after he became a hero were filled with surprises and joy.</div><div class="calibre5">Because he was with them, he was able to continue the battle against the Demon King's army until the end.</div><div class="calibre5">Eventually──the Demon King was defeated by other heroes.</div><div class="calibre5">However, the battle did not end yet.</div><div class="calibre5">The remnants of the Demon King's army were still attacking various places, and Harold and his comrades went around to exterminate them.</div><div class="calibre5">One day, Harold was told by [Light] in his holy sword that someone with a powerful [Darkness] had appeared.</div><div class="calibre5">He and his friends head for that person──</div><div class="calibre5">This is how he was captured in the base of the remnants of the Demon King's army.</div><div class="calibre5">"I've screwed up...... but I'm going to pay her back for this."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold left the room.</div><div class="calibre5">He gathered his comrades from the other rooms into his own room.</div><div class="calibre5">All of them had unfocused eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">"It seems that Frangulas' [Charm] is still in effect......."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold mumbled.</div><div class="calibre5">I want to get them back to normal somehow.</div><div class="calibre5">At the moment he wished that.</div><div class="calibre5">──Thump!</div><div class="calibre5">The holy sword pulsed harder than ever.</div><div class="calibre5">A dazzling white glow flooded the surroundings.</div><div class="calibre5">Their unfocused eyes came back into focus.</div><div class="calibre5">"Huh? This is......."</div><div class="calibre5">"Where the h*ll, are we──"</div><div class="calibre5">"......! Have you come to your senses?"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold breathed a sigh of relief.</div><div class="calibre5">"Listen, guys. We're in Franjulas──"</div><div class="calibre5">And, he explained what had happened to them.</div><div class="calibre5">"I see, so we were fascinated by that demon's [Charm]......"</div><div class="calibre5">They bit their lips and groaned.</div><div class="calibre5">"What are we going to do now, Harold?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Isn't it obvious? We're going to take down Frangulas!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold said emphatically.</div><div class="calibre5">"And one more...... my memory is a bit vague, but...... I think I saw the figure of "Hero Knight, Margo", who is a companion of Hero Yuno."</div><div class="calibre5">Maybe he's just as Harold and the others, got fascinated by Frangulas' [Charm].</div><div class="calibre5">If so, it would be better to bring Margo back to her senses and fight together.</div><div class="calibre5">After all, the enemy is the former 13 executives of the Demon King's Army, Frangulas and Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold and the others may or may not be able to defeat them on their own.</div><div class="calibre5">So he believed that Margo would be a reassuring companion.</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's find him first."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold and the others left the room.</div><div class="calibre5">And──high-pitched footsteps were approaching from the end of the hallway.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold and the others braced themselves.</div><div class="calibre5">"I felt a strong [Light], so I came here and found that──you had broken my [Charm]."</div><div class="calibre5">The one who appeared was a beautiful woman in black──The Vampire's True Ancestor, Frangulas.</div><div class="calibre5">"As expected of a Hero."</div><div class="calibre5">"You! How dare you!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold's voice was filled with anger.</div><div class="calibre5">"Your strength is quite impressive. So, I'd like to use you as pawns──"</div><div class="calibre5">The smiling eyes of Frangoulas suddenly shone with a mysterious light.</div><div class="calibre5">She activated her [Charm] skill once again.</div><div class="calibre5">"[Gale Wall]."</div><div class="calibre5">A moment later, Harold activated the skill of his holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">A pale blue wind covers the surroundings.</div><div class="calibre5">It's a barrier of holy wind that repels everything, regardless of whether it's physical or magical.</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas's eye-light was blocked by it and did not reach Harold and the others.</div><div class="calibre5">"Your [Charm] doesn't work anymore!"</div><div class="calibre5">With the holy sword in his hand, Harold shouted.</div><div class="calibre5">He felt the power of the holy sword increasing more than before.</div><div class="calibre5">This time, I can win──</div><div class="calibre5">"I will obliterate you, demon!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Fufu, do you think that the power of the vampire's true ancestor is only [Charm]? If I can't use you as a pawn, I'll just have to find another way to use you──."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold and the others and Frangulas faced off, sparks of fighting spirits flying around.</div>

<p><strong>5 &#8211; Hero Harold's Counterattack 2</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">Harold looked at the beautiful woman in black standing in front of him, Frangulas.</div><div class="calibre5">A vampire.</div><div class="calibre5">And the most powerful one among them, the true ancestor.</div><div class="calibre5">In addition to her strong life force, which could be called immortal, she has mobility far beyond that of a human, and a vast amount of magical power──.</div><div class="calibre5">So, her status was overwhelming.</div><div class="calibre5">"Now, how do we attack her?"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold grabbed his holy sword "Garlev" and thought to himself.</div><div class="calibre5">The orthodox strategy would be──taking advantage of the advantage in numbers of five to one and pushed with the number.</div><div class="calibre5">"We're going to push through at once."</div><div class="calibre5">He told Isabelle, who was holding a spear next to him, as well as the archer Irvine, the wizard Joseph, and the monk Rosa, who were standing behind him.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill activation──[Whirlwind Blade]!"</div><div class="calibre5">He shot hundreds of blades of wind from the "Garlev" he wielded.</div><div class="calibre5">In addition, his comrades support him with magic, physical attacks, and auxiliary magic.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not so naive as to be pushed around so easily, you know."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas, as expected, was not a simple opponent.</div><div class="calibre5">She put up magical barriers or transformed her own body into a myriad of bats to ward off their attacks.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a back-and-forth battle.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold and the others attacked.</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas dodged them.</div><div class="calibre5">Conversely, her counterattacks were blocked by Harold's holy sword and Rosa's defensive magic.</div><div class="calibre5">With neither side having a decisive move to make, the battlefield was deadlocked──</div><div class="calibre5">But, suddenly, the situation in the battle moved.</div><div class="calibre5">"Guaah......"</div><div class="calibre5">With a cry of anguish, the young archer collapsed.</div><div class="calibre5">A blue spear-like object pierced his chest.</div><div class="calibre5">It had suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</div><div class="calibre5">"Fufu, were you caught off guard? I also have this technique, you know."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas laughed gleefully.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a magic spear that she had created with her own blood.</div><div class="calibre5">"Irvine!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold let out a scream that was almost a shriek.</div><div class="calibre5">His companion, with whom he had shared his pain and suffering for two years, was no longer twitching.</div><div class="calibre5">He died in an instant.</div><div class="calibre5">"YOU BASTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRD!"</div><div class="calibre5">Joseph, the boy wizard, shouted in anger.</div><div class="calibre5">"Burn it down, [Firestorm]!"</div><div class="calibre5">He unleashed advanced fire magic.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill [Reflection]."</div><div class="calibre5">The edge of Frangulas' mouth lifted into a wicked smile.</div><div class="calibre5">"G, GYAAAAAAAAAAAAHH!?"</div><div class="calibre5">At the same time, Joseph was burned away by the fire magic he had unleashed.</div><div class="calibre5">The wizard-boy crumpled to the ground, charred to a crisp.</div><div class="calibre5">He twitched for a while, and then stopped moving.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ugh...... Joseph......!"</div><div class="calibre5">In the blink of an eye, he had lost two of his comrades, and Harold bit his lip.</div><div class="calibre5">Isabelle and Rosa were also pale in the face.</div><div class="calibre5">"From five against one down to three against one, I don't think you can push your way through anymore."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas held out her right hand and pointed at Isabelle and Rosa.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not sure what to say. I'll spare your life at least for now, Hero-sama. Coz, you may still have some use──"</div><div class="calibre5">"Fak......!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold bit his lip bled.</div><div class="calibre5">In the midst of the back-and-forth battle, Frangulas must have been waiting for an opportunity to launch a surprise attack.</div><div class="calibre5">She took down Irvine in no time, and then turned the tables on Joseph.</div><div class="calibre5">He knew she was strong.</div><div class="calibre5">The ability of the vampire ancestors was overwhelming.</div><div class="calibre5">If this continues, they will be slain as well and for sure──</div><div class="calibre5">"Now, pierce them. My [Demon Spear]."</div><div class="calibre5">A spear of blue blood emerged from the void and headed for Isabelle and Rosa.</div><div class="calibre5">"STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPP!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold shouted.</div><div class="calibre5">"You are not going to take any more of my friends!"</div><div class="calibre5">As if in response with the strengthened will, the blade of the holy sword pulses throbbingly.</div><div class="calibre5">The two jewels in the hilt shone with a dazzling light.</div><div class="calibre5">When the blue blood spear was touched by the light, it disappeared without a trace.</div><div class="calibre5">"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold continued to shout.</div><div class="calibre5">Hot──</div><div class="calibre5">Something simmering flowed into Harold's body.</div><div class="calibre5">"The power...... power is, overflowing ......!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold raised his holy sword high in the air.</div><div class="calibre5">The high spirits in his heart were empowering the holy sword strength!</div><div class="calibre5">"O Holy Sword, summon the wind! And cut away all the [Darkness]!"</div><div class="calibre5">The S-curved blade vibrated the air.</div><div class="calibre5">"Superior Skill Activation── [Phoenix Whirlwind Blade]!"</div><div class="calibre5">The flash that he swung down created a jade-colored wind that slammed into Frangulas.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kyaaaaa~......!?"</div><div class="calibre5">With a scream, the vampire beauty was blown away.</div><div class="calibre5">"T, to be able to manipulate this much [Light]──No way, it was almost like the Holy Sword [Arc]."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangoulas backed away as if puzzled.</div><div class="calibre5">On the other hand, Harold's whole body was full of strength.</div><div class="calibre5">I can win.</div><div class="calibre5">Even if the opponent is a vampire's true ancestor.</div><div class="calibre5">The current me can certainly finish him off──</div><div class="calibre5">Such overwhelming confidence overflowed.</div><div class="calibre5">And,</div><div class="calibre5">"Harold-dono!"</div><div class="calibre5">Someone came running up to him.</div><div class="calibre5">A middle-aged knight with a fearless face.</div><div class="calibre5">It was Margo Lascada, The Hero Knight.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll help you."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo glanced at the vampire, and then told him in a dignified manner.</div><div class="calibre5">"It seemed that I had been fascinated by her [Charm]. But, perhaps because of the damage she has sustained, it has been undone──Now is the time to fight alongside you and defeat the remnants of the Demon King's army!"</div><div class="calibre5">"It's very reassuring to have you on our side."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold grinned.</div><div class="calibre5">It gave him hope.</div><div class="calibre5">With this, the tide of war had suddenly turned in their favor.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm pretty sure you have a wind magic armor, right? I'm going to go first, and I need you to cover me."</div><div class="calibre5">"Understood. Let's fight together, Hero Harold."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo replied in a sincere tone.</div><div class="calibre5">"Then──here we go. This is your demise, Frangulas!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold kicked the floor and lunged at the vampire beauty.</div><div class="calibre5">The holy sword "Garlev" shone with dazzling brilliance.</div><div class="calibre5">──In the next moment, a hot shock rushed through his chest.</div><div class="calibre5">"Gah......ha......!?"</div><div class="calibre5">It was──not Frangulas' attack.</div><div class="calibre5">The attack came from behind.</div><div class="calibre5">When he looked back, he saw Margo standing there with a bloody sword in his hand.</div><div class="calibre5">"KYAAA~......"</div><div class="calibre5">"AAAAA~......"</div><div class="calibre5">With a scream, Isabelle and Rosa were cut down by Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">"W, why......?"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold groaned in disbelief and collapsed on the spot.</div><div class="calibre5">"Franjulas is still important to us. I can't let you kill her here."</div><div class="calibre5">The Hero Knight gave a wicked smile as he told him.</div>

<div class="calibre5">"Gu..... haaa....."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold, who was pierced in the chest, could not be able to stay on his feet and fell on the spot.</div><div class="calibre5">"Is it an act of saying that the [Charm] has been undone...... to catch me off guard......."</div><div class="calibre5">No, wrong.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold quickly corrected that thought.</div><div class="calibre5">In Margo's eyes, there was clearly a light of strong will.</div><div class="calibre5">It's not possible for a person who had been fascinated and lost their will to have such a light in their eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">This means that──</div><div class="calibre5">(Margo is cooperating with the remnants of the Demon King's army of his own volition.......?

<div class="calibre5">"A member of Hero Party? You think I'm an add-on to the hero? Absolutely not!　I'm The Hero Knight, Margo!

<div class="calibre5">"Activate the altar......you said?"</div><div class="calibre5">[The Black Altar is powered by darkness. The reason why I am collecting the grudge of the demons is to activate the altar.]</div><div class="calibre5">The Demon King answered my question.</div><div class="calibre5">[But that level of grudge is still not enough. If you have the powerful Darkness, then──]</div><div class="calibre5">"And, what happens when I activate the altar?"</div><div class="calibre5">[Gain, power.]</div><div class="calibre5">The Demon King's answer was simple.</div><div class="calibre5">[You seek more power, don't you? To fulfill your desire. To settle your thoughts.]</div><div class="calibre5">My expression soured as I saw through his words.</div><div class="calibre5">It was true that I need power.</div><div class="calibre5">But it was too dangerous to take the Demon King's words at face value.</div><div class="calibre5">I couldn't afford to misjudge the information and make the wrong choices.</div><div class="calibre5">Now, what should I do...?</div><div class="calibre5">Just as I was pondering this again, my vision suddenly switched.</div><div class="calibre5">"What is, that......?"</div><div class="calibre5">The first thing I saw was an endless blue sky.</div><div class="calibre5">Then a huge lump of rock──almost as big as a continent──was floating there.</div><div class="calibre5">A floating continent.</div><div class="calibre5">That was the word that came to my mind.</div><div class="calibre5">If I looked at the rock, I could see countless buildings.</div><div class="calibre5">[A civilization that flourished in ancient times──Remuscelia.]</div><div class="calibre5">The Demon King's voice echoed from somewhere.</div><div class="calibre5">"That is...... Remuscelia?"</div><div class="calibre5">I scrutinized it</div><div class="calibre5">This time, I saw a cityscape.</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed to be a city on a floating continent.</div><div class="calibre5">However, it was a very different cityscape from the world we live in.</div><div class="calibre5">The huge buildings that stood in a row had a strange box shape, and some of them were tens or hundreds of meters high.</div><div class="calibre5">It was like a giant tower.</div><div class="calibre5">The number of people passing by was probably several hundred times greater than even the royal capital of a large country.</div><div class="calibre5">Everywhere I looked, there were people, people, people.</div><div class="calibre5">In addition, on the main street, instead of horse-drawn carriages, there were iron vehicles with strange designs.</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't know much about it, but it seemed that that ancient civilization was far more prosperous than ours.</div><div class="calibre5">Why did such a super civilization perish......?</div>
<div class="calibre5">Suddenly, a black mist spread across a corner of the sky.</div><div class="calibre5">"That's──"</div><div class="calibre5">In another direction, something like a white mist was generated.</div><div class="calibre5">[The [Abyss] and [Nirvana].]</div><div class="calibre5">The Demon King informed me.</div><div class="calibre5">Each of them was the ruler of [Darkness] and [Light], I guess.</div><div class="calibre5">[And──that's the war between [Darkness] and [Light] that destroyed Remuscelia.]</div>
<div class="calibre5">※</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre6">&lt;HAROLD's SIDE&gt;</b></div><div class="calibre5">"Hurry get out of here, Harold!"</div><div class="calibre5">"We'll hold them off!"</div><div class="calibre5">Isabelle, the spearwoman, and Rosa, the monk, shouted.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ugh, you two......."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold was unable to move.</div><div class="calibre5">There was no way he was going to leave his comrades behind and run away.</div><div class="calibre5">In addition, one of them──Isabelle, was also Harold's girlfriend.</div><div class="calibre5">"If we die, there will be a replacement. But there is no replacement for you, Harold!"</div><div class="calibre5">Isabelle said with a tragic determination.</div><div class="calibre5">"Please.

Power to protect what is important to me──)</div><div class="calibre5">He hoped.</div><div class="calibre5">He prayed.</div><div class="calibre5">He begged for the power to defeat the demon.</div><div class="calibre5">"Don't worry. I'll kill you all together, so you won't be lonely in the afterlife."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo gave a cruel smile.</div><div class="calibre5">The sword in his hand called the wind and let out a roar.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hero Harold, I will retrieve your holy sword. Then dedicate it to the altar later."</div><div class="calibre5">"Altar......?"</div><div class="calibre5">"It's a bad habit of yours to slip your tongue easily, Margo-san"</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas glared at Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">"It won't matter. They're all going to die right here."</div><div class="calibre5">Yet Margo was unconcerned.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll execute them No, the two women there are quite beautiful, and their bodies don't look too bad. Maybe I can keep them for a night mate. I'm getting tired of demonesses."</div><div class="calibre5">"Don't f*ck with us......!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold bit his back teeth tightly.</div><div class="calibre5">"I will protect you both! And I'll avenge Joseph and Irvine!"</div><div class="calibre5">And so──Hero Harold's desperate battle begins.</div>

<p><strong>10 &#8211; Quality of a Hero</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">"Hmm, shall I try to fight you first before I fight Yuno."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo snorted and put on his full-face helmet.</div><div class="calibre5">From behind the mask, a pair of piercing and glinting eyes looked at Harold.</div><div class="calibre5">His eyes were muddy.</div><div class="calibre5">"A strategy for the hero, huh."</div><div class="calibre5">A Hero is one who protects others and vanquishes evil! One who fights for the hope of the people! I will not be defeated by an "evil" like you! In the name of Hero I'll──"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold shouted with dignity.</div><div class="calibre5">He held up the holy sword Garlev to his right eye.</div><div class="calibre5">A green magic wind swirled around the blade.</div><div class="calibre5">Coincidentally, his opponent also had a sword that manipulated wind magic.</div><div class="calibre5">"Wind versus wind, huh?"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo, who was holding his sword in a fighting stance, murmured.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill activation──[Whirlwind Blade]!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold released hundreds of wind blades from his holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill activation──[Heavenly Riotous Angel Feathers]."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo cloaked himself in the wind and leaps sideways with the force of the wind.</div><div class="calibre5">He landed on the ground just out of the way of the wind blades and raised his sword.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill activation──[Blessing Arrows]!"</div><div class="calibre5">A feather-shaped light bullet is released from the raised blade.</div><div class="calibre5">"Wha!? Isn't that a holy sword skill──!?"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold backed in surprise.</div><div class="calibre5">His sword can also shoot the same skill.</div><div class="calibre5">That's why he knew.</div><div class="calibre5">What Margo shot just now was undoubtedly the same skill.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a skill of the holy sword that only a Hero could perform──.</div><div class="calibre5">"No, it's not."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo shook his head.</div><div class="calibre5">"That was not of the holy sword's skill. That was a [Light] skill. That was the power I got from the Black Altar."</div><div class="calibre5">The Hero Knight kicked the ground after he told so.</div><div class="calibre5">He was fast.</div><div class="calibre5">It was hard to believe that he was wearing heavy armor.</div><div class="calibre5">Margo, who had been known as a fierce fighter even before joining the Hero Party, was no match for him.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold barely caught the slash that was delivered.</div><div class="calibre5">"Heavy......!"</div><div class="calibre5">A tremendous numbness was felt in both his arms.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold took a big leap back.</div><div class="calibre5">If he was a pure swordsman, his opponent was better than him.</div><div class="calibre5">With just one strike, Harold realized this.</div><div class="calibre5">If there was a chance to win, it would be with his ability as a hero──in other words, the power of the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill activation──[Blessing Arrows]!"</div><div class="calibre5">Once again, Margo fired a volley of light bullets.</div><div class="calibre5">The number of bullets exceeded a hundred.</div><div class="calibre5">"Furthermore, Skill activation──[Wind of Severance]!"</div><div class="calibre5">Huge vacuum blades──the Kamaitachi──also flied from his magic weapon, "The 77-forms Gale Thunder King Sword".</div><div class="calibre5">"Tsk."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold parried them with his [Whirlwind Blade].</div><div class="calibre5">The power was even.</div><div class="calibre5">Kabooooooommmmm!</div><div class="calibre5">The explosion filled the field of vision.</div><div class="calibre5">Margo rushed forward from beyond it.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold dodged the second slash without getting hit.</div><div class="calibre5">He took his distance.</div><div class="calibre5">But then, Margo would fire a series of [Blessing Arrow] and [Wind of Severance].</div><div class="calibre5">Once he parried the attacks, Margo rushed forward in the gap.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sh*t......!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold clicked his tongue.</div><div class="calibre5">His opponent had the edge in close combat, and even when he opened up the distance, Margo was quickly closed in──.</div><div class="calibre5">He was forced to be on the defensive.</div><div class="calibre5">"No matter how good the sword was, it was still in its initial state. If you haven't released your [Arc], my magic sword and skills are stronger!"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo shouted and unleashes a slash.</div><div class="calibre5">The wind-covered blow knocked the holy sword out of Harold's hand.</div><div class="calibre5">"D*mn──"</div><div class="calibre5">"It's my victory."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo exclaimed triumphantly.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kehkehkeh, this feels so good. Even a man who has been called Hero is no match for me, a Hero Knight."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo laughed and swung his sword.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kyaaaa!?"</div><div class="calibre5">The wind howled and Isabelle and Rosa were restrained.</div><div class="calibre5">They are pulled straight to Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll take these girls."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo held them both with his arms on either side, as if to flaunt to Harold.</div><div class="calibre5">"N, no......"</div><div class="calibre5">They both expressed humiliation and disgust.</div><div class="calibre5">The sight of them made the core of his head burn.</div><div class="calibre5">"Stop ITTTTTTTTT!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold exclaimed.</div><div class="calibre5">I'll protect you both.</div><div class="calibre5">To do that, I'm going to defeat him──.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold's will was growing.</div><div class="calibre5">He was becoming more and more furious.</div><div class="calibre5">"UAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"</div><div class="calibre5">The Holy Sword, which had been flung away, slid through the air as if it had a will of its own and returned to Harold's hand.</div><div class="calibre5">With a thud, the entire sword pulsated.</div><div class="calibre5">A pure white radiance flooded the area.</div><div class="calibre5">"What?"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo shouted in surprise.</div><div class="calibre5">"This unusual light from the holy sword──can it be!"</div><div class="calibre5">"No way, this is──"</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas, who was watching the battle, also looked astonished.</div><div class="calibre5">"The Holy Sword is about to evolve into [Arc]......!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Arc......you said?"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold mumbled.</div><div class="calibre5">He'd heard of this.</div><div class="calibre5">The true form of the Holy Sword, held only by Hero Yuno.</div><div class="calibre5">And his holy sword Garlev is about to reach it──?</div>

<p><strong>11 &#8211; True Radiance</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">The radiance of the Holy Sword increased.</div><div class="calibre5">Crack...... crack.......</div><div class="calibre5">Countless cracks ran down the blade of the sword.</div><div class="calibre5">And then it snapped.</div><div class="calibre5">The shape of the sword changed.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold was surprised.</div><div class="calibre5">The blade with a jade-colored shine was curved greatly and looked like a scythe.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold held up the new holy sword, Garlev, and faced Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">"You really reach the power of [Arc]? No way──"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo mumbled in dismay.</div><div class="calibre5">"Impossible......!"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo pushed Isabelle and Rosa out of his arms and readied his sword once again.</div><div class="calibre5">Margo fired a wind slash with almost no motion.</div><div class="calibre5">It came at super-speed, and</div><div class="calibre5">Thwack!</div><div class="calibre5">The wind barrier around Harold easily dispersed his attacks.</div><div class="calibre5">It was not something he consciously created.</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed that the basic function of the holy sword was now equipped with an autoguard.</div><div class="calibre5">"So this new holy sword did some protection for me. Then there is only one thing for me to do──"</div><div class="calibre5">Told Harold, then he kicked the ground.</div><div class="calibre5">"Offense, only go offense!"</div><div class="calibre5">At the same time, a gust of wind was released from the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">Using it as propulsion, he super-accelerated.</div><div class="calibre5">It was so fast that it surpassed even the speed of sound, and immediately Margo was within his striking distance.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ridiculous, it's too fast──"</div><div class="calibre5">"It's over!"</div><div class="calibre5">With a roar, he swung down his whirlwind-covered blade.</div><div class="calibre5">"D*mn ......!"</div><div class="calibre5">The Hero Knight raised his sword and blocked the attack.</div><div class="calibre5">"Wh, what the...... so much pressure......!"</div><div class="calibre5">With each block, Margo was blown wide open.</div><div class="calibre5">"Haa, haa, haa......"</div><div class="calibre5">His full-body armor was more than half shattered, as if ripped by the shockwave.</div><div class="calibre5">"You seemed to be having a tough time on your own. I will assist you."</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas extended her graceful hand.</div><div class="calibre5">An intangible magical shockwave was released.</div><div class="calibre5">If it were to hit a human being, it would annihilate that person without leaving any flesh and bone.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's futile!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold brushed it off with a swing of his holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">"Wha......?"</div><div class="calibre5">"This is the same power as Yuno's holy sword, or even more──has he awakened into the true radiance [Arc] after all......?"</div><div class="calibre5">Frangulas and Margo simultaneously exclaimed in surprise.</div><div class="calibre5">"Without going through a ceremony, and with only his own spirit──"</div><div class="calibre5">"I will go to any lengths to become stronger for my friends."</div><div class="calibre5">Harold readied his holy sword and declared.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm not the person I was when I was alone anymore. I have comrades. And I had friends who were important to me. You guys make me strong. And the utmost──make me better."</div><div class="calibre5">To avenge the regret of those friends he couldn't protect.</div><div class="calibre5">And to protect those who were here with him.</div><div class="calibre5">"I will defeat you. Heed my call! My sword, Garlev!"</div><div class="calibre5">With a high shout, the holy sword roared.</div><div class="calibre5">Vooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooommm!</div><div class="calibre5">A whirring sound, similar to the roar of a beast, echoed through the air.</div><div class="calibre5">The blade of the holy sword cracked from the center, and the built-in crystals emitted a jade-green glow.</div><div class="calibre5">Half by instinct, Harold realized.</div><div class="calibre5">That was the final attack form of the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">And that was the form to release its true power──the true radiance of the Holy Sword.</div><div class="calibre5">"Now, begone...... Corrupted Hero Knight!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold raised his holy sword and shouted in a dignified voice.</div><div class="calibre5">"For your friends, huh?"</div><div class="calibre5">Shudder──</div><div class="calibre5">A bad premonition ran down his spine.</div><div class="calibre5">"If that's the case, it can be your weakness as well."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo had a cruel smile on his face.</div><div class="calibre5">In his hands, Isabelle and Rosa were being held as before.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a, momentary lapse.</div><div class="calibre5">"Go ahead, shoot at me. If you're ready to tear your friends to pieces."</div><div class="calibre5">They were hostages and shields to protect Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a sneaky way to fight.</div><div class="calibre5">But he was at his wits' end──.</div><div class="calibre5">"Right, that holy sword has automatic protection, doesn't it? Get it deactivated as well."</div><div class="calibre5">"You......!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Hurry up, keh keh keh."</div><div class="calibre5">In provocation to him, Margo pressed the blade of his sword against Isabelle's cheek.</div><div class="calibre5">A red streak ran down her beautiful face.</div><div class="calibre5">"You...... B*STAAAAARRRRRDD......!"</div><div class="calibre5">Harold exclaimed with a feeling of vomiting blood.</div><div class="calibre5">"Autoguard...... deactivate......!"</div><div class="calibre5">He called to the Holy Sword, and then Garlev made a growling sound.</div><div class="calibre5">"That was close. If it was a one-on-one fight, I would not have won. I admit it. You are the true hero."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo laughed.</div><div class="calibre5">"And your indomitable spirit. The kindness you show toward your friends. But know that it also leads to weakness."</div><div class="calibre5">"What a coward──."</div><div class="calibre5">"The thing most necessary for victory and glory is not justice. Nor love. Nor ideals."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo laughed and pushed Isabelle and Rosa away.</div><div class="calibre5">Harold brandished his holy sword and stopped moving there.</div><div class="calibre5">No shot.</div><div class="calibre5">There was no way he could shoot Margo as long as the girls were in the path of the attack.</div><div class="calibre5">But while he was avoiding them, Margo's attack came flying at him──.</div><div class="calibre5">A moment later, Harold realized this.</div><div class="calibre5">He would lose.</div><div class="calibre5">If he had been ruthless──if he had abandoned them, he would have won for sure.</div><div class="calibre5">But he just couldn't do it.</div><div class="calibre5">No matter what──it was impossible for him.</div><div class="calibre5">"There is only one thing that is necessary. To get what you want by any means necessary, and──"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo holds up his sword.</div><div class="calibre5">A gale was in the blade.</div><div class="calibre5">"It is greed."</div><div class="calibre5">A slash of wind was released and decapitated Harold's head.</div>

<p><strong>1 &#8211; The First Stage</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">"The prehistoric civilization is so easily──"</div><div class="calibre5">I was stunned by the images the Demon King showed me.</div><div class="calibre5">The prehistoric civilization of Remuscelia boasted prosperity and splendor that far surpassed that of the present day.</div><div class="calibre5">However, this great civilization was destroyed by the clash of [Light] and [Darkness]──by [Nirvana] and [Abyss].</div><div class="calibre5">Huge magical armors and dragons stand up to protect the world.</div><div class="calibre5">However, they were helplessly blown away by [Nirvana] and [Abyss].</div><div class="calibre5">The floating continent was obliterated without a trace, and some of its structures crashed to the ground and became ruins.</div><div class="calibre5">[I don't know everything.

To gain even more power.]</div><div class="calibre5">"The legacy of Remuscelia, huh?"</div><div class="calibre5">I looked at the altar in front of me.</div><div class="calibre5">I could almost hear my heart pounding.</div><div class="calibre5">Something inside me was raging.</div><div class="calibre5">Or maybe──rejoicing.</div><div class="calibre5">As if in response to the altar.</div><div class="calibre5">Aah, what is this feeling actually?</div><div class="calibre5">It's not the same as simple joy or excitement.</div><div class="calibre5">Yup, this is──the feeling of nostalgia.</div><div class="calibre5">Looking at the altar, I felt a strange stirring of nostalgia.</div><div class="calibre5">"I am......."</div><div class="calibre5">Almost unconsciously, I walked up to the altar.</div><div class="calibre5">"Chrome-sama!"</div><div class="calibre5">Someone hugged me from behind.</div><div class="calibre5">"......
