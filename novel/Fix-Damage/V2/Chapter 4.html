<div class="calibre5">''The only thing missing is the orb that recorded the [Chain of Darkness] spell. Was it stolen........"</div><div class="calibre5">I grumbled as I looked at the empty shelves.</div><div class="calibre5">Looking at the hair on the floor, it was most likely the work of that guy called Mikha from earlier.</div><div class="calibre5">"What would you do now, Chrome-sama?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Chase him."</div><div class="calibre5">I said so immediately.</div><div class="calibre5">Then I looked at Yulin.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry. I'll definitely find the way to break your curse. Can you wait for a moment?"</div><div class="calibre5">Based on the circumstances, it probably hadn't been that long since Mikha escaped.</div><div class="calibre5">I might be able to catch him up.</div><div class="calibre5">In order to prepare for the battle against Yuno, The Hero of [Light], that's coming up, I'd like to obtain the orb that recorded the research about [Chains of Darkness].</div><div class="calibre5">"Of course, I can. Because, You have sealed that Valery and saved a lot of test subjects!"</div><div class="calibre5">And Yulin.</div><div class="calibre5">"You can aside me for later. Please do what you have to do first, Chrome-san."</div><div class="calibre5">"He'll definitely take care of you, Yulin-chan. So don't worry, Chrome-sama is a man who keeps his word."</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes."</div><div class="calibre5">Those two girls were smiling at each other.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea looked at me and her expression tightened.</div><div class="calibre5">''Would you like me to seek him first?</div><div class="calibre5">"Can I?"</div><div class="calibre5">I asked Shea.</div><div class="calibre5">"But don't get too far. He's Valery's best disciple──he's abilities of the court magician's level. When you find him, come back and let me know."</div><div class="calibre5">"Acknowledged. Chrome-sama."</div><div class="calibre5">After kneeling and bowing, Shea stood up.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill [Acceleration]."</div><div class="calibre5">Her movement immediately became a red flash trajectory.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea went off at super-fast speed and then returned in no time.</div><div class="calibre5">As expected, it was a tremendous speed.</div><div class="calibre5">And the report was──.</div><div class="calibre5">"He's in the village...?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Yes. I found him in a village about two kilometers from here. He was chatting amicably with the villagers..."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea nodded at my words.</div><div class="calibre5">"About two kilometers away is──it must be my village, then."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin said that.</div><div class="calibre5">"Is that so?"</div><div class="calibre5">"That is."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin's face was happy.</div><div class="calibre5">"How's the situation?"</div><div class="calibre5">"He was having a field day with the village girls."</div><div class="calibre5">"He has a nice face, after all."</div><div class="calibre5">I laughed bitterly.</div><div class="calibre5">"He's indeed a pretty guy. Ah, no, I'm sorry."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea murmured and quickly bowed her head.</div><div class="calibre5">"You do not need to apologize."</div><div class="calibre5">''Fufu, to Shea-san, Chrome-san is more and more than him, right?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Mou, Yulin-chan, you're really!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Ufufu, Shea-san, your feeling is leaked out of control.</div><div class="calibre5">"Lie, is it so clear?"</div><div class="calibre5">"It is."</div><div class="calibre5">"So that...."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin smiling, and Shea had a tight face.</div><div class="calibre5">''It's at a level that anyone but maybe Chrome-san would notice."</div><div class="calibre5">"Ahaha, I see..."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea blushed.</div><div class="calibre5">"Shea-san is a maiden after all, How cute."</div><div class="calibre5">"Enoughー, Mou. Ehehe."</div><div class="calibre5">For some reason, the two of them were amicable.</div><div class="calibre5">What a heartwarming's sight.</div><div class="calibre5">But let's put this conviviality aside for now.</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's go toward him."</div><div class="calibre5">I urged them on and headed for the village.</div><div class="calibre5">Even though it's two kilometers, it's a <i class="calibre8">good</i> distance for my weakened feet.</div><div class="calibre5">In the middle of our advance, I was out of breath.</div><div class="calibre5">"I can't get any closer..."</div><div class="calibre5">Suddenly, Yulin stopped in her tracks.</div><div class="calibre5">──Her curse, the [Darkness Pheromone] had the ability to lure monsters.</div><div class="calibre5">Moreover, at nighttime, it was way easier to lure.</div><div class="calibre5">"Chrome-sama, Once again I'll go alone from here. I'll go get him."</div><div class="calibre5">"......But"</div><div class="calibre5">"Yulin-chan can't get close, right. And if you ended do lure monsters, Chrome-sama's skill is more reliable in repelling it."</div><div class="calibre5">And Shea.</div><div class="calibre5">"First of all, if you get near to Mikha, He'll definitely kill you."</div><div class="calibre5">"Well, that is..."</div><div class="calibre5">I understood that, but...</div><div class="calibre5">I still felt uneasy.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll be fine. Please keep Yulin-chan safe, Chrome-sama."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea smiled.</div><div class="calibre5">Her fighting ability, including her skills, had reached the hero class.</div><div class="calibre5">Well, it's not going to happen very often.</div><div class="calibre5">"Don't push yourself too hard. That's an order."</div><div class="calibre5">"Acknowledged, my Lord."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea pressed her lips against the back of my hand and ran out with her [Acceleration] skill.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">Don't overdo, Shea──.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I murmured again in my mind.<br class="calibre5" /></div>

In one of them.]</div><div class="calibre5">Sure enough, Lakshasa smiled,</div><div class="calibre5">[However, in order to obtain it, Master must go through the trial.]</div><div class="calibre5">"Trial....."</div><div class="calibre5">I took a small breath.</div><div class="calibre5">I overwhelmed Yuno in the battle inside "Black Phase &lt;Qliphoth&gt;".</div><div class="calibre5">But that doesn't mean I can relax.</div><div class="calibre5">Just as my [Darkness] is getting stronger, so is his [Light].</div><div class="calibre5">I want to gain the power to defeat him for sure.</div><div class="calibre5">Having the tables turned is, I can not afford such a thing and die leaving things this way.</div><div class="calibre5">"Then, the next destination is the Principality of Lyju."</div><div class="calibre5">It is the homeland of Fara, a swordswoman, one of the hero party.</div><div class="calibre5">Gaining more "power" and revenge on Fara──it's hitting two birds with a stone.</div><div class="calibre5">Fortunately, we were on the border between Ralpha and Lyju.</div><div class="calibre5">Just a short distance toward the Principality.</div><div class="calibre5">"May I have a...... question for you, Chrome-sama?</div><div class="calibre5">Shea spoke from the side.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">……Nn?</i></div><div class="calibre5">She looks strangely displeased face.</div><div class="calibre5">"That person is──the usual [Darkness], isn't she? I can see the figure clearly...."</div><div class="calibre5">".....yeah, that reminds me, I haven't introduced her."</div><div class="calibre5">At any rate, I didn't know her name until after I moved to [Black Phase &lt;Qliphoth&gt;], and even after I returned, I didn't have time to explain because of the fight against Mikha.</div><div class="calibre5">"She is [Darkness]──to be exact, an embodiment of a part of it. She was called a terminal or something like that, but..... her name is Rakshasa."</div><div class="calibre5">I told to both of them.</div><div class="calibre5">[Once again... Nice to meet you two, the [Subordinate]s.]</div><div class="calibre5">Rakshasa pinched the edge of her black skirt and bowed gracefully.</div><div class="calibre5">Then she entwined her arms around me.</div><div class="calibre5">I could feel her soft bulge pressing against my arm.</div><div class="calibre5">"... Aren't you getting too clingy to Chrome-sama?"</div><div class="calibre5">Shea became more and more displeased.</div><div class="calibre5">"Shea-san is jealous, yea.... how cute."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin smiled.</div><div class="calibre5">"Eh!? Ah, wa, no, not it !? I am, umm..."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea immediately waved her hands as if in a panic.</div><div class="calibre5">"You're getting cuter and cuter."</div><div class="calibre5">[You're quite innocent, yes. But──a more adult woman may be more ideal to Master.]</div><div class="calibre5">"Adult woman...."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea mumbled, repeating Rakshasa's words.</div><div class="calibre5">[I have no such experience myself, but... I have seen various Masters in my life, so I am very knowledgeable. If you like, I can teach you later.]</div><div class="calibre5">Rakshasa said.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">……Hey, what are you talking about from earlier?</i></div><div class="calibre5">[Surely this will be useful in seducing Master.]</div><div class="calibre5">"Seducing...Chrome-sama ..."</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, Shea-san, you have a nosebleed!"</div><div class="calibre5">"Kyaa, I just imagined it a little ... aah...&nbsp; I'm so embarrassed."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea and Yulin were making noises, and Rakshasa smiled.</div><div class="calibre5">"Why you all are getting noisy just by a moment......."</div><div class="calibre5">I muttered with a sigh.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">My party is──</i>.</div>
