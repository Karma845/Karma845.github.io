<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Omen of Magic War</h3>

<p><strong>1 &#8211; Hero vs. Blue Dragon</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre6">&lt;YUNO's SIDE&gt;</b></div><div class="calibre5">"This place is──"</div><div class="calibre5">When he noticed, he found himself in the castle.</div><div class="calibre5">In front of him is a figure of a dragon, shaking its huge blue body.</div><div class="calibre5">It is a high-ranking demon, Lagios, one of the former 13 Demon King's Executive, and now was the leader of the remnants of the Demon King's Army.</div><div class="calibre5">And next to him is a beautiful swordswoman with highly exposed skin.</div><div class="calibre5">She was Fara, a member of the Hero party.</div><div class="calibre5">"I thought you've vanished, but you reappeared huh..."</div><div class="calibre5">"Yuno...!?"</div><div class="calibre5">Both Lagios and Fara were surprised.</div><div class="calibre5">After all, he was moving from this world to "<b class="calibre6">Qliphoth</b>".</div><div class="calibre5">And──after a slight time lag, he came back.</div><div class="calibre5">"Yo, your arm...!?"</div>

<div class="calibre5">Fara gulped while looked at his right arm.</div><div class="calibre5">No, to be exact, where she looked was the place where his right arm was before.</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno's right arm had disappeared in the battle against Chrome.</div>

<div class="calibre5">He had been given first aid by the [Light], so the pain was considerably lessened.</div><div class="calibre5">As expected, the lost arm won't recover.</div><div class="calibre5">"Hmm, I thought you'd ran away."</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios taunted him.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll erase you this time for sure. This is revenge for the Demon King!"</div><div class="calibre5">It was going to launch a dragon breath again.</div><div class="calibre5">"Fara-san, stand back"</div><div class="calibre5">While Yuno held Arkweiss in his left hand, he told her so.</div><div class="calibre5">──The war situation has not changed.</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios was equipped with the "<b class="calibre6">Barrier Crest</b>".</div><div class="calibre5">It is an item that took over the damage that the user received.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a troublesome item that couldn't be destroyed except you dealt 30,000 damage on it.</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno's holy sword could cause about 6000 damage per hit.</div><div class="calibre5">It had already taken one hit earlier, but he would have to slash four or five more times to defeat Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">But before that, he would be obliterated by dragon breath──</div><div class="calibre5">"Give up. It's faster for me to wipe you out with my breath than for you to launch an attack on me."</div><div class="calibre5">A vivid glow converged in the mouth of the dragon.</div><div class="calibre5">"Surely, you're faster."</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno responded bitterly.</div><div class="calibre5">He had managed to escape from Chrome before, but now he had a new problem.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">(As if I'll let myself die here, huh)</i></div><div class="calibre5">He regripped the holy sword in his left hand.</div><div class="calibre5">It's hard to evade the breath in the confined space of the castle.</div><div class="calibre5">If only he could get out to a bigger place──</div><div class="calibre5">[You don't have to run away, Master]</div><div class="calibre5">A voice was heard.</div><div class="calibre5">Before he knew it, a fat man was standing right next to him.</div><div class="calibre5">It was the embodiment of the will of [Light]──or he used to call himself as [Terminal]──Vayu.</div><div class="calibre5">[In the battle with [Darkness] earlier, the power of Master was rising. [Darkness] and [Light] enhance each other, therefore.]</div><div class="calibre5">"My power, is ..."</div><div class="calibre5">[You can use new skills.]</div><div class="calibre5">At the same time as Vayu told him, images flowed into Yuno's brain.</div><div class="calibre5">Instead of explaining the new skills that Yuno acquired, Vayu seemed to have planted them.</div><div class="calibre5">"... I see, so that is it."</div><div class="calibre5">A strong light of will lighted up in Yuno's eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">Sure, with that he doesn't have to run away.</div><div class="calibre5">"Have you braced yourself, Hero!"</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios shouted arrogantly.</div><div class="calibre5">"Yeah"</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno grinned.</div><div class="calibre5">"Cause I'm going to enter a new phase."</div><div class="calibre5">"Screw you! And be gone!!"</div><div class="calibre5">The blue dragon released a breath.</div><div class="calibre5">"Activating the skill──"</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno raised the holy sword.</div><div class="calibre5">A golden light rose from the blade, followed by a jet-black glow.</div><div class="calibre5">"[Chaotic Cherry Blossom Shield &lt;<b class="calibre6">Aegis</b>&gt;]!"</div><div class="calibre5">A shining shield appeared in front of Yuno.</div><div class="calibre5">A huge shield about 5 meters square, colored in black and gold light.</div><div class="calibre5">As soon as the dragon's breath touched the shield, it vanished without a trace.</div><div class="calibre5">"You absorbed my breath !?"</div><div class="calibre5">"Absorbed? It's different, you know."</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno's smile deepened.</div><div class="calibre5">Immediately afterward, a blast of light exploded behind Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">"Gaa ...!?"</div><div class="calibre5">The blue dragon staggered with a cry of anguish.</div><div class="calibre5">"My breath is──"</div><div class="calibre5">Yes, it was his own dragon breath that attacked Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">It appeared behind the giant dragon and exploded.</div><div class="calibre5">"My shield didn't "<i class="calibre8">absorbed</i>" your attack. It "<i class="calibre8">transferred</i>" your attack to a certain point──"</div><div class="calibre5">Even with this skill, will it be enough to counter Chrome's skill?</div><div class="calibre5">[No, this shield alone is very not enough.]</div><div class="calibre5">Responded by Vayu.</div><div class="calibre5">[There are some restrictions on [Damage Transfer]. It can't transfer skills or magic that belong to the same or higher level.]</div><div class="calibre5">"....More power is needed in order to defeat Chrome-kun."</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno exhaled a small sigh and returned his gaze to Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">For now, the countermeasure against Chrome had to save for later.</div><div class="calibre5">"First of all, let's get rid of you."</div><div class="calibre5">"Screw it. As if I'm not going to let you kill me so easily"</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios growled.</div><div class="calibre5">Although it was wounded, it still able to move.</div><div class="calibre5">──The fierce battle resumed.</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno fought with his skills and holy sword, but because he had lost his right arm, his attacks are not as powerful as they could be.</div><div class="calibre5">On the other hand, Lagios was also wounded, and its attack power and agility decreased.</div><div class="calibre5">The battle went on and on.</div><div class="calibre5">Not long after, the situation suddenly changed.</div><div class="calibre5">"Gaaaaaa...!"</div><div class="calibre5">With a cry of pain, Lagios staggered.</div><div class="calibre5">From the other side, the sound of boots was approaching.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry, I'm late. I'll help you, Yuno."</div><div class="calibre5">The one who came was a middle-aged knight with a sword gripped in his hand.</div><div class="calibre5">"Margo-san!"</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno's face lit up at the arrival of his reliable friend.</div>

<p><strong>2 &#8211; An Uneasy Conclusion.</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre6">&lt;YUNO's SIDE&gt;</b></div><div class="calibre5">Hero Knight Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">A veteran warrior who was renowned as the strongest knight in the Luphus Empire.</div><div class="calibre5">He was a knight among knights, with an impeccable personality and ability, and was respected by many people.</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno met him while traveling with Chrome, Irina, Valery, and others, and had him join the party.</div><div class="calibre5">At all times, he calmly assessed the battle situation and uses his sword and skills with perfect precision.</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno had been saved by him many times.</div><div class="calibre5">And even now──.</div><div class="calibre5">"You came, Margo-san."</div><div class="calibre5">"I'm sorry I was late, Yuno. Fara too."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo walked up to him.</div><div class="calibre5">A full-face helmet and armor were covering his entire body.</div><div class="calibre5">He was a fully armed knight.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mmm, your arm is──"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo looked surprised at Yuno's lost right arm.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ee, this..."</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno gave a bitter smile.</div><div class="calibre5">"Let's save the details later. Now we've to focus on the fight against Lagios. Fara-san, you take care not to get any collateral damage.."</div><div class="calibre5">"....I'm sorry. I can't give you any help."</div><div class="calibre5">"It's okay. I will protect you."</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno gave Fara a refreshing smile.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">I wonder if it left an impression on her a little──</i></div><div class="calibre5">In the corner of his head, he was thinking about that.</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll be on the left-side and Margo-san on the right-side, please."</div><div class="calibre5">"I understand."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo held up his shining sword.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">Gouu...!</i></div><div class="calibre5">A noise was sounded, and a light greenish wind clung to the blade.</div><div class="calibre5">The first-class magical armor, <i class="calibre8">"The 77-forms Gale Thunder King Sword"</i>.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a treasure sword that can be said to be the signature of the Hero Knight Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">Although not as good as Yuno's holy sword, it was the strongest sword that could cut through even the high-ranking demons.</div><div class="calibre5">"Skill <b class="calibre6">[Blessing Arrows]</b>!"</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno yelled.</div><div class="calibre5">A total of 70 feather-shaped light bullets were released.</div><div class="calibre5">"Just something like that!!"</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios shot them all down with a breath, but a few of them managed to evade.</div><div class="calibre5">A thunderous sound was heard.</div><div class="calibre5">The damages caused by exploding light bullets were taken by the <i class="calibre8">"Barrier Crest"</i> that Lagios was wearing.</div><div class="calibre5">"Then, me too──with my sword!"</div><div class="calibre5">Margo gripped his sword, and ran from the opposite direction</div><div class="calibre5">"<b class="calibre6">[Severing Wind]</b>!"</div><div class="calibre5">A huge vacuum blade──A kamaitachi, slammed into Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">The second, third,──fifteenth shots cut shallowly through Lagios' torso.</div><div class="calibre5">Blue fresh blood splashed.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">GUAAAAAAAAAAA!</i></div><div class="calibre5">Lagios screamed.</div><div class="calibre5">At last, it broke through the endurance of the <i class="calibre8">"Barrier Crest"</i> and damaged Lagios directly.</div><div class="calibre5">"GODDAMN... YOUUUUUUUUUU!"</div><div class="calibre5">With a roar of anger, the demon dragon swung its huge tail.</div><div class="calibre5">"Kuh...!"</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno quickly blocked it with his defensive skill <b class="calibre6">[Flower Protection]</b>.</div><div class="calibre5">However, he could not kill the power and was blown away.</div><div class="calibre5">Margo, on the other hand, slipped through its tail as if he were reading the attack.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a great maneuver.</div><div class="calibre5">Accelerating and closing in on the blue dragon, Margo made a huge leap.</div><div class="calibre5">With a jump so powerful that it was hard to believe he was clad in heavy armor, he thrust his treasured sword into its chest.</div><div class="calibre5">"GUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios screamed.</div><div class="calibre5">Then Margo climbed up the dragon's body.</div><div class="calibre5">"This is the end!"</div><div class="calibre5">He pulled another sword from his back and stabbed it into the dragon's forehead.</div><div class="calibre5">The screams remarkably loud and eventually become smaller and smaller.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">Zu .. n!</i></div><div class="calibre5">The earth was shaking by the dragon's huge body that collapsed.</div><div class="calibre5">Margo landed on the ground, and pulled out the <i class="calibre8">"The 77-forms Gale Thunder King Sword"</i>.</div><div class="calibre5">The sword stuck in its forehead still there.</div><div class="calibre5">"Margo-san, you did it!"</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno run up to him.</div><div class="calibre5">"What is that sword?"</div><div class="calibre5">"It's a kind of <i class="calibre8">"Dragon Killer"</i> that I got the other day. It's hard to use against the highest-class dragons, but I thought that it might do if it was a damaged Lagios. and it turned to be work better than I expected."</div><div class="calibre5">Margo said with satisfaction when he saw the fallen Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">"That sword is, the mark of its tombstone, huh?"</div><div class="calibre5">Certainly, the blue dragon didn't even twitch.</div><div class="calibre5">Its heart had already stopped beating, and he no longer felt any of the magical power that had flooded its body.</div><div class="calibre5">Lagios was dead.</div><div class="calibre5">※</div><div class="calibre5"><b class="calibre6">&lt;MARGO's SIDE&gt;</b></div><div class="calibre5">The next day──.</div><div class="calibre5">A knight visited Lagios' castle.</div><div class="calibre5">A white knight in full gear.</div><div class="calibre5">It was Margo.</div><div class="calibre5">At the back, a giant blue dragon was still lying.</div><div class="calibre5">"How are you feeling, Lagios?"</div><div class="calibre5">"...I had a terrible experience. The power of the Hero, should not be underestimated."</div><div class="calibre5">When Margo called out, Lagios slowly got up.</div><div class="calibre5">The sword that still on its forehead disappeared without a trace when the demon dragon shook its giant body.</div><div class="calibre5">In yesterday's battle, it wasn't <i class="calibre8">"Dragon Killer"</i> that Margo had stabbed at Lagios.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a treasure sword that put the target in a state of temporary death for a whole day.</div><div class="calibre5">Thanks to that, both Yuno and Fara believed that Lagios was dead.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">(Hmm, he's easy to be fooled. He's indeed the strongest in terms of fighting ability, but he's still mentally weak.)</i></div><div class="calibre5">Margo grumbled inwardly.</div><div class="calibre5">Anyway, the first stone had been laid.</div><div class="calibre5">With that, now the attention on Lagios would be lessened.</div><div class="calibre5">And It would make it easier for Lagios to do all sorts of schemes.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">(Eventually, I will defeat the hero and make the name of Margo Laksada known all over the world. Wealth, glory, women──anything you could want in the world is within my grasp.......!)</i></div>

<p><strong>3 &#8211; Principality of Lyju</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">We entered the Principality of Lyju.</div><div class="calibre5">Although a small country, it had a long history and was dotted with ancient ruins.</div><div class="calibre5">There may be a way to counter [Chaos] in them──.</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed that Valery found the [Chain of Darkness] spell from one of those ruins.</div><div class="calibre5">It may sound like grasping at clouds, but let's try to find out first.</div><div class="calibre5">We continued along the highway.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's getting a little chilly around here."</div><div class="calibre5">I shivered.</div><div class="calibre5">Compared to the Kingdom of Shadi and the Kingdom of Larva, where I had been, this was much colder.</div><div class="calibre5">"Are you cold, Chrome-sama?"</div><div class="calibre5">While saying, Shea snuggled up to me.</div><div class="calibre5">"Th... this is, to help keep you warm, even a little."</div><div class="calibre5">"Thanks."</div><div class="calibre5">I wasn't strong, I considerably weaker than the average person.</div><div class="calibre5">This was because of the influence of cursed by [Chain of darkness] two years ago.</div><div class="calibre5">I was also vulnerable to cold and heat, so I was grateful for Shea's thoughtfulness.</div><div class="calibre5">"Then, me too"</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin also snuggled up to me from the other side.</div><div class="calibre5">I was sandwiched between these two girls.</div><div class="calibre5">It was getting warmer now.</div><div class="calibre5">"Mmmu... could it be, Yulin-chan is also after Chrome-sama..."</div><div class="calibre5">"Ara, I'm just trying to make Chrome-sama a little more comfortable, you know."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin smiled at Shea, who seemed to be sulking for some reason.</div><div class="calibre5">When I saw the bewitching crimson glow in her eyes, I realized once again that she was no longer a human.</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin had become my [Subordinate], and the [Darkness] skill I gave her turned her into a demon.</div><div class="calibre5">Demon.</div><div class="calibre5">As the name suggested, it was a human being with demonic attributes.</div><div class="calibre5">They had strong physical strength, high vitality, and immense magical power.</div><div class="calibre5">Since Yurln had just become a demon, she was not yet at a high level, but she still possessed overwhelming magical power compared to humans.</div><div class="calibre5">If she trained herself, she would become even stronger.</div><div class="calibre5">However, even if you called her "Demon", she looked almost the same as when she was a human being.</div><div class="calibre5">She had blue hair cut off at the shoulders, and a pretty face.</div><div class="calibre5">Wearing a maid-like apron dress.</div><div class="calibre5">The only difference was that the tips of her ears were a little sharper than before, and her whole body was covered with a terrifying miasma──.</div><div class="calibre5">In the moonlight, I was standing in front of a tree.</div><div class="calibre5">Shea and Yulin were waiting a few meters away.</div><div class="calibre5">"Can we get started, Rakshasa"</div><div class="calibre5">[Anytime. Master.]</div><div class="calibre5">A beautiful woman in a black robe appeared as if oozing out of the void.</div><div class="calibre5">She was the terminal of [Darkness]──Rakshasa.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">*Clank.</i></div><div class="calibre5">I lightly swung the black chain that extended from my right hand.</div><div class="calibre5">What I was about to do now was,&nbsp; performance tests of this chain.</div><div class="calibre5">It was a new power that had become able to be used, probably because the [Darkness] within me had increased.</div><div class="calibre5">What I could do and could not do with this chain.</div><div class="calibre5">It was necessary to test it for future battles.</div><div class="calibre5">──Move.</div><div class="calibre5">When I thought about it, the tip of the chain shifted</div><div class="calibre5">After all, it moved according to my will.</div><div class="calibre5">I didn't have to say loudly, I simply just had to think in my mind.</div><div class="calibre5">──Extend.</div><div class="calibre5">The next was, to measure the length.</div><div class="calibre5">The chain took my will and extended.</div><div class="calibre5">When it reached about 100 meters ahead, it stopped.</div><div class="calibre5">It seemed that it was the limit.</div><div class="calibre5">"The approximate "range" is about 100 meters, huh..."</div><div class="calibre5">I tried to move it in that state, but the movement was slower than before.</div><div class="calibre5">The longer it was extended, the less power it had to bind or strike.</div><div class="calibre5">Also, even though it was capable to strike, the attack power itself was about the same level as a warrior's.</div><div class="calibre5">In terms of the amount of damage, it probably 10 or 20.</div><div class="calibre5">Naturally, it couldn't be compared to [Fixed Damage]'s 9999 damages.</div><div class="calibre5">After all, it was more suitable to be used for restraining and twisting like I had done to MIkha before.</div><div class="calibre5">Besides, the black chain reached farther than [Fixed Damage], and it seemed to be quite useful in other ways than attacking.</div><div class="calibre5">──I finished a series of performance tests and walked up to Shea and Yulin.</div><div class="calibre5">"Sorry to keep you waiting"</div><div class="calibre5">"Thank you for your hard work, Chrome-sama"</div><div class="calibre5">Shea took out a towel and wiped my face with it.</div><div class="calibre5">I must have used more energy than I thought, and before I knew it, I was sweating.</div><div class="calibre5">"Thank you."</div><div class="calibre5">"Uu~, I wanted to do that too..."</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin mumbled.</div><div class="calibre5">"Ah, I, I'm sorry. Then, it's Yulin-chan's turn now."</div><div class="calibre5">Shea hurriedly handed Yulin a towel.</div><div class="calibre5">"Eee, Thank you very much"</div><div class="calibre5">Yulin thanked her and took the towel.</div><div class="calibre5">Taking turns with Shea, Yulin wiped the sweat off my face this time.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">.....It's not like I sweated so much that it took two people to wipe it off, you know.</i></div><div class="calibre5">That was when I chuckled inwardly.</div><div class="calibre5">"Those who possessing wicked power──we're here to destroy you!"</div><div class="calibre5">A voice was heard from the bushes behind me.</div><div class="calibre5">A group of people appeared.</div><div class="calibre5">A swordsman, a spearman, an archer, a wizard, a monk... there were five in all.</div><div class="calibre5">"There's no doubt about it──they seem to have the power of [Darkness]."</div><div class="calibre5">"Then, this is The Hero Harold's turn!"</div><div class="calibre5">"I'll show you that Yuno and his companions aren't the only hero party out there!"</div>

<div class="calibre5">They all raised their spirits at once.</div><div class="calibre5">"These people are──"</div><div class="calibre5">I raised my eyebrow.</div><div class="calibre5">I had known them for a while two years ago, when I was still a member of the hero party.</div><div class="calibre5">They were a hero party different from Yuno and co.</div>

<p><strong>4 &#8211; Hero Harold</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">Seven heroes.</div><div class="calibre5">These are the seven warriors who were chosen by God and given the holy swords.</div><div class="calibre5">Of course, Yuno is one of them.</div><div class="calibre5">Two years ago, when the whole world was frightened by the threat of the Demon King Vilgarodomus──</div><div class="calibre5">The seven heroes, along with their parties, were fighting the Demon King's army in various locations.</div><div class="calibre5">It should have been a noble battle to protect the world......but even the heroes are still human.</div><div class="calibre5">With vanity and the desire for honor involved, the seven heroes and their parties began to compete with each other for battle results.</div><div class="calibre5">Yuno's Party, to which I belonged, was the lowest among the seven heroes.</div><div class="calibre5">I think some of the members were getting impatient with that.</div><div class="calibre5">The only one who clearly expressed his attitude was Riot......</div><div class="calibre5">I'm sure Yuno and the others were getting impatient inwardly as well.</div><div class="calibre5">This is why they sacrificed me to gain more powerful power.</div><div class="calibre5">In the end, Yuno and his party managed to defeat the Demon King and became the most outstanding of the seven heroes.</div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">The most powerful Hero Party.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">A symbol of justice and peace.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">The descent of divine power.</i></div><div class="calibre5"><i class="calibre8">Great heroes who will be remembered for eternity──</i></div>

No, umm......"</div><div class="calibre5">Normally, it would not be allowed to challenge a minister to a duel.</div><div class="calibre5">However, Fara was a different story.</div><div class="calibre5">She was a hero of the Principality of Lyju.</div><div class="calibre5">She was given special treatment in every way.</div><div class="calibre5">The ministers must have known that.</div><div class="calibre5">"H-hiii, please forgive me."</div><div class="calibre5">Even though they knew that Fara's character was fierce, they did not even expect her to challenge them to a duel.</div><div class="calibre5">They're so easygoing, she thought to herself with disdain.</div><div class="calibre5">"──Do you think I will forgive you?"</div><div class="calibre5">Fara said with a cold look in her eyes.</div><div class="calibre5">The fεεling of sad*sm flares up.</div><div class="calibre5">A swεεt fεεling of euphοria ran through the core of her chest.</div><div class="calibre5">"Gya......AAAAAAA......!"</div><div class="calibre5">──A few minutes later, their cries of agony echoed in the square on the outskirts of the castle.</div><div class="calibre5">Their limbs were cut off by Fara, and they cried out in agony as they writhed in extreme pain.</div><div class="calibre5">"It's a good thing we have a high-rank priest to keep you alive. I'll have them cast a healing spell right now, and your lives will be saved. Only your lives, okay?"</div><div class="calibre5">She looked down at them coldly.</div><div class="calibre5">She wiped the blοοd from her sword and put it in its sheath.</div><div class="calibre5">She then turned her back on them and left without even giving them a glance.</div><div class="calibre5">"I can't get excited dealing with those with those little bastards, Haaa."</div><div class="calibre5">Even after she returned to the mansion, I still didn't feel any better.</div><div class="calibre5">It felt good to have beaten them and made them pay for their disdain for her, but that was only temporary.</div><div class="calibre5">After all, it was in extreme combat that Fara was most excited.</div><div class="calibre5">The battle with Lagios the other day, although she had lost, had been much more fulfilling than today.</div><div class="calibre5">Just thinking about it made her excited and her lower abdomen started to burn sweetly.</div><div class="calibre5">"Phew, I guess I'm getting a little hοrny."</div><div class="calibre5">Fara lιckεd her lips.</div><div class="calibre5">If fighting didn't make her feel better, something else would.</div><div class="calibre5">More and more mysterious heat rushed through her body.</div><div class="calibre5">Fara went to one of the seven bedrooms.</div><div class="calibre5">She used the dοοrbell to summοn her three favorite peοple.</div><div class="calibre5">A young boy with an innocent face.</div><div class="calibre5">A woman before her thirtieth, who, despite her plain appearance, is surprιsιngly wιld in bεd.</div><div class="calibre5">A fearless, muscular, middle-aged man.</div><div class="calibre5">Fara smiled as she looked around at her lovers who had arrived.</div><div class="calibre5">"Thank you very much for having me. Fara-sama."</div><div class="calibre5">The three bowed down in unison.</div><div class="calibre5">One by one, they kιssεd Fara's tοεs.</div><div class="calibre5">"Now, all of you serve me whοleheartedly. Make me feel gοοd."</div><div class="calibre5">The swordswoman smiled a mysterious smile──.</div>

<p><strong>8 &#8211; Announcement of The Omen</strong></p>

<div class="calibre5">After a delightful time, Fara left the bεdrοοm and entered the large bathroom.</div><div class="calibre5">After having fun with hεr lovεrs, she always washed her body here.</div><div class="calibre5">Her companion was her favorite girl slave.</div><div class="calibre5">She was very attentive and mainly took care of Fara's pεrsonal nεεds.</div><div class="calibre5">Of course, when the mοοd struck her, she would sometimes invite her in the night.</div><div class="calibre5">"Phew!"</div><div class="calibre5">Fara flushed her hot, flaming brown nakεd bοdy with water.</div><div class="calibre5">The swεεt aftertaste lingerεd in hεr bοdy.</div><div class="calibre5">The bad mood was not completely cleared up, but she felt somewhat refreshed.</div><div class="calibre5">"You seem to be satisfied, Fara-sama."</div><div class="calibre5">The girl slave knelt beside her and washed her arms and legs reverently.</div><div class="calibre5">"Well well. It's not as exhilarating as fighting a powerful enemy, but those thrεε made me fεεl gοοd."</div><div class="calibre5">Fara smiled lustily.</div><div class="calibre5">"That's good to hear."</div><div class="calibre5">The girl slave smiled happily.</div><div class="calibre5">Looking at her pretty, beautiful face, she was getting hοrny again.</div><div class="calibre5">"You're going to havε to sεrvε me a little, too....... Comε."</div><div class="calibre5">"Y-yes, Fara-sama. With pleasure──"</div><div class="calibre5">She blushed happily when Fara invited her.</div><div class="calibre5">"You're really cute, you know that?"</div><div class="calibre5">Fara pullεd her face closer to takε hεr flowεry lips──</div><div class="calibre5">The next moment, the girl slave's body exploded.</div><div class="calibre5">"This is──"</div><div class="calibre5">Countless pieces of flesh and fresh blood rained down.</div><div class="calibre5">While being drenched with them, Fara didn't change her expression at all.</div><div class="calibre5">She immediately switched her consciousness to battle mode.</div><div class="calibre5">"Who is it!"</div><div class="calibre5">She shouted in a sharp voice and ran to the wall.</div><div class="calibre5">She took the sword that was leaning against the wall.</div><div class="calibre5">"Do you know that I'm Fara Zaed!"</div><div class="calibre5">She held up her sword, exposing her glamorous nakεd body.</div><div class="calibre5">She looked around warily.</div><div class="calibre5">[Don't be alarmed. I'm on your side.]</div><div class="calibre5">Along with the voice, a yellowish-white light flashed before her.</div><div class="calibre5">A fat man appeared out of the light.</div><div class="calibre5">"You are──"</div><div class="calibre5">Fara leaked a surprised voice.</div><div class="calibre5">[The name is Vayu. A follower of the Hero, Yuno.]</div><div class="calibre5">"Vayu......?"</div><div class="calibre5">[Probably it would be easier to say...... the entity that gives power to the holy sword Arcweiss?"</div><div class="calibre5">That said, she'd heard about it from Yuno.</div><div class="calibre5">The holy sword had a power called [Light].</div><div class="calibre5">It had its own will and helped Yuno.</div><div class="calibre5">"So you are, that [Light]?"</div><div class="calibre5">With her nakεd body exposed, Fara turned her sharp gaze on the man.</div><div class="calibre5">[I'm just a piece of [Light], to be exact. It's more like a terminal.]</div><div class="calibre5">And Vayu.</div><div class="calibre5">He didn't seem to be distracted by her luscious nakεd body.</div><div class="calibre5">"So you're not an enemy for now?"</div><div class="calibre5">Although said that, but Fara remained alert.</div><div class="calibre5">"Well then...... why did you kill that girl?"</div><div class="calibre5">[I didn't want her to hear about the [Light] or [Darkness].]</div><div class="calibre5">"It's unnecessary to kill her, isn't it. She's my favorite slave."</div><div class="calibre5">Fara clicked her tongue at Vayu's words.</div><div class="calibre5">"......Well, there are plenty of substitutes, though."</div><div class="calibre5">[That's cold-blooded.]</div><div class="calibre5">"I don't want to hear it from you who shattered her."</div><div class="calibre5">Fara glared at Vayu.</div><div class="calibre5">"'And I'm not cold-hearted, I'm just rational."</div><div class="calibre5">[Hmm. That's an essential qualification.]</div><div class="calibre5">"As a swordsman, yes."</div><div class="calibre5">[As a user of──[Light].]</div><div class="calibre5">Vayu grinned.</div><div class="calibre5">"A user of the light......?"</div><div class="calibre5">[A part of Yuno's [Light] resides in you. Just like the rest of the hero party. Therefore──I can contact you, albeit in a limited way.]</div><div class="calibre5">Vayu explained.</div><div class="calibre5">[Two years ago, the ritual of "Chain of Darkness" brought down [Darkness] and [Light]──and as a result, "Darkness" and the "Light" in various parts of the world have been drawn together and are strengthening their power over each other. Eventually, they will cover the entire world.]</div><div class="calibre5">"What......are you talking about?"</div><div class="calibre5">[Protect Yuno, Fara Zaed.]</div><div class="calibre5">The man who called himself the terminal of [Light] announced solemnly.</div><div class="calibre5">[Prepare yourself for the upcoming battle. A fearsome user of [Darkness] will soon appear to take revenge on the Hero.]</div><div class="calibre5">"Someone who will take revenge on the Hero......?"</div><div class="calibre5">[If Yuno is defeated, the world will be covered in [Darkness]. The only person who can prevent that is you.]</div><div class="calibre5">"I...... protect Yuno......."</div><div class="calibre5">Fara ruminated on Vayu's words.</div><div class="calibre5">She walked out of the bathhouse onto the balcony.</div><div class="calibre5">Before she knew it, the sun had already set.</div><div class="calibre5">The night sky was full of stars.</div><div class="calibre5">In one corner, she saw an unusually red star.</div><div class="calibre5">A star that she couldn't see until yesterday──.</div><div class="calibre5">[It might be the omen of the Demon King's resurrection.]</div><div class="calibre5">Vayu said.</div><div class="calibre5">[Or the birth of a new Demon King──]</div><div class="calibre5">"What?"</div><div class="calibre5">[It's about time I reach the limit I can materialize here. I have to leave soon.]</div><div class="calibre5">Vayu's figure started to fade away.</div><div class="calibre5">[Don't forget what I just said. Protect Yuno, Fara. Protect [Light].]</div><div class="calibre5">"Protect [Light]......."</div><div class="calibre5">[And in case of emergency, use [Light] that resides inside you. I'm not going to let [Darkness]──the Legion of [Abyss], have their way with this world.]</div><div class="calibre5">Leaving enigmatic words behind, Vayu disappeared completely.</div><div class="calibre5">Fara was standing quietly with her nakεd brown body exposed to the night darkness.</div>
