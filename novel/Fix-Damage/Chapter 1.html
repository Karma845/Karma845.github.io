<h2 class="calibre2">Chapter 1 &#8211; Darkness Awakens</h2>

<p><strong>1 &#8211; The Day All Was Lost</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">“When the battle against the Demon Lord’s army is over…I want you to make me your bride, Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">That night, I had received a sudden proposal. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It came from the priest Irina, a member of the hero’s party, and my lover. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She’s twenty-one years old, three years younger than me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She was a beautiful woman with long blond hair and lovely blue eyes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">We were in the courtyard of a hotel and nobody was around. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was just the two of us under the pale moonlight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“S, sorry, I got ahead of myself. You must be surprised by how sudden this is.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Ah, she’s so cute. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“No, the feeling’s mutual. Irina, let’s get married once our fight is over.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Our battle is always accompanied by danger. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, we’ll definitely make it through. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then, we’ll lead a life of happiness. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina and I.</p>



<p class="calibre3">The next day, the hero’s party began a battle against the Demon Lord army’s front base. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Die, hero and all else!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A gigantic black dragon shouted. </p>



<p class="calibre3">That dragon is one of the top ranked among the Demon Lord’s army, the “Dark Dragon.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A powerful enemy who possesses an intelligence above that of humans, leading to it possessing powerful magic, and had a tough vitality as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It assaulted us with its flaming dragon breath. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“‘Holy Shield!'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina chanted an incantation. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A shield of glittering energy emerged, repelling the breath. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was one of the best defense magic options, unique to a priest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Let’s go, Chrome. On my cue.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The teacher who taught me magic and a companion to our journey, the sage Valery, spoke majestically. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“‘Fire Storm!'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“‘Ice Storm!'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The Dark Dragon fell back in face of the flames and ice we both hurled together. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Arrrgh!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The black dragon swung its tail in anger. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You think we’ll let you do that?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Your opponents are us!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ooooooooough!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A giant warrior, a swordswoman, and a middle-aged knight all lunged towards it. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They were Riotte, Farrah, and Margo, the vanguard of the hero’s party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They unleashed an axe, sword, and a spear to bisect the dragon’s tail. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Grrrraaaaaaaaaaah!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The dragon flinched and screamed in pain. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Now, Yuno!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Okay.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">In response to my call, a figure flew forward in a flash. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He was a young boy with graceful looks and dazzling gold armor. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He was only one of seven “heroes” in this word, Yuno. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Destroy the demons, holy sword ‘Weiss!'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Before the dragon could readjust its posture, he swung the golden holy sword. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The blade released flashes of light, bisecting the Dark Dragon’s body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“We did it, Yuno!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“It’s all because of everyone’s support, even yours, Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno responded to what I had said with a clear smile. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I thought about how humble my companion seemed to be. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I would call this young man my close friend before calling him a hero. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The Demon Lord had been resurrected three years ago. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The Demon Lord invaded the entire world, leading thirteen troops. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Half a year later, half of the world had fallen into their hands. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In order to oppose such a force, a god had chosen seven heroes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The heroes each picked their companions and began splitting up to battle against the Demon Lord’s army. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I, Chrome Walker, was one of those people selected for being in the “hero’s party.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">We returned to an inn after defeating the Dark Dragon. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The battle against one of thirteen leaders of the Demon Lord’s army, Frangulas, is close. </p>



<p class="calibre3">We’ve already hunted down seven of Frangulas’ powerful monster subordinates, including today’s Dark Dragon. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Since the enemy’s forces have reduced significantly, it’s about time to begin the fight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Actually, it was Valery, the party’s adviser, who decided that now was the time. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Oh right, I’ll go see Irina’s face before heading to bed.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I left my room. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Teacher Valery, Riotte, Margo, and I were staying at one floor. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Farrah, Irina, and the hero Yuno were staying at the floor upstairs. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I headed towards the above floor while the stairs creaked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Huh…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thereupon, I froze in shock. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I wanted to see you…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Me too…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spotted a shadow entering Yuno’s room stealthily, as if not wanting to be seen. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Could it be? </p>



<p class="calibre3">It must be a mere misunderstanding. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, no matter how I looked at it… </p>



<p class="calibre3">I saw the figure of Irina, who supposedly vowed yesterday to be with me in the future. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Why is Irina in Yuno’s room…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Though puzzled, I soon shook my head. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina probably went to Yuno’s room to take care of some business. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’d be a fool to suspect my lover and best friend for even a moment. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I wanted to say good night to Irina, but I guess not today. I’ll sleep in preparation for what’s to come tomorrow.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I turned around. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──I wanted to see you </p>



<p class="calibre3">──Me too. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Those voices from just a moment ago echoed within my head. </p>



<p class="calibre3">When I tried to go down the stairs, my legs halted. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…I can’t, it’s really on my mind.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I knew it was a bad thing to do, but I retracted my steps. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I silenced my footsteps and headed towards Yuno’s room </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s not like I’m suspicious. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I just want to check. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I gently pressed my ear against the door while feeling a sense of guilt. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Irina, I love you…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, me too…I love you, hero…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The voices I heard caused me to blank out. </p>



<p class="calibre3">What’s going on…?! </p>



<p class="calibre3">The next thing I heard was a faint breath. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The rustling of clothes being removed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A sweet and flirtatious voice, the creaking of a bed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Before long, Irina let out a cry of pleasure that not even I had heard. </p>



<p class="calibre3">What is going on…?! </p>



<p class="calibre3">I screamed internally. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina, didn’t you say that you wanted to marry me? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno, weren’t we best friends? </p>



<p class="calibre3">So what’s going on with those two…? </p>



<p class="calibre3">That evening, I couldn’t get a wink of sleep. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Good morning, Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno gave his greetings as he descended to the dining hall on the first floor. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He had his usual clear, gentle smile. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You look pale, you know? Is your condition okay?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">It didn’t seem like his concern towards me was superficial at all. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It looked like he was genuinely worried about me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I can’t believe what happened last night. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Are you not feeling well?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina approached while also seeming worried. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The both of them displayed their usual attitudes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s as if what I saw yesterday was just some bad dream. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I definitely heard it. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was in so much shock that nothing else registered in my mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">As her lover, should I have entered that room? </p>



<p class="calibre3">I ended up just fleeing from the scene. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“It’s…nothing.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I said that to the best of my ability. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The time is ripe. Let’s head out to subdue Frangulas soon.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Teacher Valery proposed as such. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Indeed. He’s not a threat if we all band together. Right, Chrome?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno expressed his agreement. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Huh? Oh, um…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If anyone happens to fall under danger, I’ll definitely protect them with my defense magic.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina displayed her usual courageous self. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The other three also showed their enthusiasm and talked about how “the battle will be today.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I could see a glimpse of anxiety within everyone’s faces. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──The difference in achievements between our party and the other six parties was like night and day. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The other parties had at least taken down one of the leaders of the Demon Lord’s army. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, we were the only ones who have not yet killed any leader at all. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Now then, let’s depart. We’ll definitely defeat Frangulas.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno didn’t have his usual clear smile, but instead held a rather stiff expression. </p>



<p class="calibre3">We traversed into a deep forest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Eventually, we would supposedly find Frangulas’ castle. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah…Aah…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, my entire body was attacked by a fierce numbness. </p>



<p class="calibre3">That numbness soon turned into a sharp pain that coursed throughout my entire body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“T, this is…? Guh…uhhhh.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">No longer having any strength in my knees, I fell over. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My breathing turned rough, I raised my head while I was on my hands and knees. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Forbidden Arts ‘Chains of Despair.'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">When I looked up, Teacher Valery was looking down at me with a blank expression. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sorry, Chrome. You’re the sacrifice.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sacri…fice…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Remember how I said that the time was ripe? Our hero needs more power in order to defeat Frangulas.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What…are you…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">My mind suddenly turned blank. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“So for that reason, we will begin the rites, Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina spoke coldly to me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Huh, what’s the meaning of this…? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her indifferent gaze towards me had not an ounce of the affection she had when she was my supposed lover. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sorry, but be the sacrifice.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The other three, the warrior Riotte, the swordswoman Farrah, and the knight Margo, all looked down at me with an apathetic gaze as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“We call upon a curse. This curse will give birth to ‘darkness,’ but will also give birth to a strong ‘light’ at the same time.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Teacher Valery──no, Valery pointed a staff at me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gaah…ahh…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The intense pain amplified. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The pain was so severe that my hair began falling off. </p>



<p class="calibre3">All of the hair that fell off turned white. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Furthermore, my hands and feet withered away in the blink of an eye. </p>



<p class="calibre3">What remained of me was practically skin and bones. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It felt as if the vitality inside me was being taken away. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At this rate, it’ll all be sucked out, and then I’ll die… </p>



<p class="calibre3">I felt despair under the fear and hopelessness. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The light created by your ‘darkness’ will strengthen the hero’s power. The deeper your ‘darkness,’ the more anger, pain, hatred, and despair you feel, the stronger your negative emotions are, the more power the hero will gain from the ‘light.’ It won’t be long before even the Demon Lord will fall.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I can’t comprehend this. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Am I being the sacrifice for some kind of ritual…?! </p>



<p class="calibre3">Judging from the words my teacher was saying, this is to make the hero stronger…? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Why…me…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Several emotions coursed through my chest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Anger. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Chaos. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Bewilderment. </p>



<p class="calibre3">And, despair. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Everyone decided on this.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“To strengthen the hero.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’re the sacrifice.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Everyone wants to survive.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte and the others each spoke. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My supposed companions tore me apart with their words. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry, she’ll make me happy.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sorry, Chrome. I won’t forget you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno and Irina embraced each other and passionately kissed right in front of my eyes, and that’s when my consciousness faded. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thus, all was lost. </p>

<p class="calibre3">And… </p>



<p class="calibre3">A “darkness” awakened within me. </p>


<p><strong>2 &#8211; The “Darkness” Awakens</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">I’ve been in love with Irina for a very long time. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I wanted to become a magician of the royal palace so that I could become a suitable man for her. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Fortunately, my talent in magic seemed to excel, and I was able to further my progress through the guidance of the sage Valery, who became my teacher. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Before long, I became the youngest magician of the royal palace at 17 years old. </p>



<p class="calibre3">So, I was nominated to be a companion of Yuno, one of seven heroes who emerged after the Demon Lord’s appearance. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At that time, Irina and Valery were nominated as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Furthermore, along the way, we came across the warrior Riotte, the swordswoman Farrah, and the knight Margo. Since then, we’ve been fighting alongside these members for five years. </p>



<p class="calibre3">We shared our pains and joys. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They were like family──no, for an orphan like me, the hero party was my family. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“But, it seems I’m the only one who thought that…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I slowly woke up. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“To them…I’ve just been a mere tool to be thrown away at any time.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">And so, I was sacrificed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was sacrificed to make the hero stronger, and then I was kicked out from the party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was thrown away. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A strong sense of loss overwhelmed me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I looked around in a solemn mood. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was in the same forest as before </p>



<p class="calibre3">My body was heavy. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t even move a single finger </p>



<p class="calibre3">Upon closer inspection, there were black chains coiling around my body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What’s this…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The chains didn’t seem to have any material substance, but were instead a kind made up of magical energy. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──Forbidden Arts “Chains of Despair”── </p>



<p class="calibre3">The words Valery said flashed into my mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The sharp pain in my body had already vanished. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, it felt as if something inside of me had disappeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“My magic…is gone…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I muttered in astonishment. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Right, I’ve lost all the magic power inside me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">This must be the work of my teacher’s Forbidden Arts. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What’s going on…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I racked my brain trying to make sense of this confusing, sudden situation. </p>



<p class="calibre3">For me, my magic was the culmination of the effort I took in training for over ten years. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was the power I took great strives to gain in order to protect the most important woman in the world, Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ve lost it all in one moment. </p>



<p class="calibre3">When I looked at my arms, they were withered like dead trees. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Silver hair coiled around my fingers, seemingly fallen from my scalp. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I had black hair until just a few hours ago. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“<em class="calibre6">Roar!</em>” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I suddenly heard a cry. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I forcibly raised my powerless body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A large horde of Sword Wolves had approached. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The demons bore their sword-like fangs, as their name suggested, and glared at me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They were opponents that I could defeat with a single attack spell if I had my magic. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“‘Fire Ball!'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I recited the spell, but nothing happened. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Damn it…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Having no means of attack, I had no chances of winning. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I tried to flee, but my body felt oddly heavy. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Not just my arms, but me legs had also withered. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I staggered, so slow that it frustrated me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They surrounded me in no time. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Tsk…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Will I be devoured at this rate? </p>



<p class="calibre3">A sense of despair welled up within me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Aaaaaaaaaaaargh!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">In the next moment, the Sword Wolves lunged at me from all sides. </p>



<p class="calibre3">An onslaught of fangs and claws. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My arms and legs were torn to pieces, they sunk their teeth into my shoulder and thighs. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah….Aah….!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A severe pain coursed through my body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Gushing blood dyed the soil a crimson color. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ha…guh…uh…ah…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Furthermore, the Sword Wolves jammed their fangs into my wrists and side. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Paralyzed from the pain, I began losing sense of my body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My consciousness was fading. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Uh..uuh……” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Is this where my life ends? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Being betrayed by the companions and the lover I trusted, the ones who used me and threw me away like rubbish, and in the end, being eaten by demons. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Oh, what have I been doing my whole life? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Where I do go wrong? </p>



<p class="calibre3">If I made a different choice at some point, would I have had better fortune? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“At a place like this.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">My body felt hot, as if on fire. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My thoughts suddenly welled up from within my body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The realization that I will die. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A defiance towards death. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My anger and hatred towards them, forming a desire for revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">And above all, a longing to live. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I still want to live. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It can’t end like this. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Absolutely not. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[User’s despair levels and hatred levels have reached the requirements.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[The progress of the rites has reached 70%.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Conditions to launch the power of ‘darkness’ have been met.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Running.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[User’s fate has been rewritten.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[User has been given the power of ‘darkness.’] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[User has been given the ability to assign skills to ‘subordinates.’] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[User has been given EX Skill ‘Fixed Damage.’] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Overview 1: current damage value is 1.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Overview 2: the range is 10 meters around the user.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Active the skill?] </p>



<p class="calibre3">I heard a serene female voice. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Is this a hallucination from being on the verge of death? </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Active the skill?] </p>



<p class="calibre3">I heard the same question. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Quite persistent for a hallucination. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…No, wait.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A skill? </p>



<p class="calibre3">──Anything is fine, I just need something that can drive away these Sword Wolves around me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke in my mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ve got nothing to lose. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[User’s wish has been confirmed.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Running.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[EX Skill ‘Fixed Damage’ will now be deployed.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Overview 1: every three seconds, a ‘fixed damage’ of 1 will be inflicted upon all enemies within range.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Overview 2: There will be lasting effects.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">In the next moment, the black chains covering my body burst apart. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Guh…aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Darkness” spread around me, making my whole body feel as if it was burning. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ooohn?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I heard countless cries of pain and confusion. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The Sword Wolves who had their fangs piercing my body suddenly retreated. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The others shook and screamed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“This…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Soon after, a majority of the Sword Wolves fled in horror. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The few remaining beasts lost their will to fight and only stared at me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">About thirty seconds to a minute had passed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, all of the Sword Wolves in that location fell down right then and there. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“They’re dead…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The ones who didn’t run away were annihilated. </p>



<p class="calibre3">What happened to my body…?! </p>



<p class="calibre3">[You’ve safely wakened, Host.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was that voice from just a moment ago. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Who are you…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[The ‘darkness’ dwelling within you.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The voice spoke. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seemed that it was speaking from within me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Darkness, was it? </p>



<p class="calibre3">[The rites gave birth to ‘light’ and ‘darkness.’ The ‘light’ went to the hero group, and the ‘darkness’ was inherited by you.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The darkness spoke. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[You’ve only awakened to it just now. Your anger, hatred, and perhaps despair. Cultivate all of your negative emotions. That will cultivate the ‘darkness’ and give you more power.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Cultivate…’darkness’…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I couldn’t quite understand what the voice was saying. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I understood that ‘darkness’ had a big role. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Anger, hatred, and despair. </p>



<p class="calibre3">If that’s the case, then I’ve experienced plenty of those. </p>



<p class="calibre3">All because of the lover and companions who betrayed me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I felt a dark flame residing in my heart. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A negative flame that will never vanish. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[There you go. You seem to be carrying a ‘darkness’ of high-caliber.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The ‘darkness’ inside me spoke while seeming happy. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Power seems to have increased just now. The damage of EX Skill ‘Fixed Damage’ has increased from 1 to 2.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">In other words, as the negative emotions inside me increase, so will the strength of the ‘fixed damage’…? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“In that case…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I bit my lip. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will develop this power, fueling it with my hatred for them.</p>


<p><strong>3 &#8211; Cultivating “Darkness” </strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">“My arms…won’t move the way I want them to.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I looked again at my arms. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They were close to being just skin and bones. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I can’t even hold a magician’s staff at this rate…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While thinking as such, I smiled in self-deprecation. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Do I even need a staff anymore? I have no magic.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I had been training as a magician for many years. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In order to protect Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I desperately studied under Valery’s guidance, memorized complex chants, studied how to control my mind, and though I wouldn’t say that I was an elite, I was quite competent. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I thought that I had the power to protect Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was the only fruits of labor that I had in my life. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I’ve lost that. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps I won’t ever be able to get it back. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I’ve already lost any reason to be a magician. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Protecting Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I no longer need to carry out that goal. </p>



<p class="calibre3">As I thought about it, her figure and Yuno’s came to mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The figures of them looking down at me as I collapsed under the sharp pain. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then, as if flaunting it, passionately exchanging a kiss. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The lips that only I was allowed to touch were taken away so easily by Yuno. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The face of complete indulgence in pleasure that Irina made as they kissed, the face that looked completely like that of a “woman’s.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The backstabbing of my lover and close friend made me want to vomit. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Damn it. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[How nice. Your thick, deep hatred is once again increasing your strength.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The voice once again spoke from inside me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The voice of the “darkness” residing within me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[The damage of EX Skill ‘Fixed Damage’ has increased from 2 to 3.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">It only went up by one? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Whatever.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">If it’s hatred I need, then I’ll seethe with as much hatred as I can. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ll slowly build my way up. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I finally obtained the power to destroy everything. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Someday, surely…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I began to walk while tottering. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Compared to my arms, which were skin and bones, my legs were a little better. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I could slowly walk, and there was a bit of pain, but there was otherwise no problem. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, it was impossible to run quickly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps I won’t be able to do any strenuous physical activity for the rest of my life. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Step by step, I walked with a frail stride. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Right now, I don’t have the power to get revenge on them. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I will make progress. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I place my trust in the pain and despair they gave me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Right now, I have to cultivate the “darkness” within me. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">I followed a mountain trail with my weakened legs. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I wanted to head towards a town first. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was strangely hungry. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Now that I think about it, I hadn’t eaten anything for more than a day. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I stood still, sensing a threatening presence. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sorry, you need to pay a toll to pass beyond here.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Ten men emerged from the bushes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They looked like bandits. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Leave all your possessions and go, hehehe.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While one of them said the words that confirmed my suspicions, the men drew their swords. </p>



<p class="calibre3">All of them had foolish smiles. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Each of them seemed to be looking down on me, carrying eyes of contempt. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Since I had become thin to the point of being like a dead tree, it seems that they perceived my weak self as prey. </p>



<p class="calibre3">If it had been my previous self, I could’ve dealt with all of them using a few magic attacks. </p>



<p class="calibre3">There’s a big difference between them and the Sword Wolves from just before, but I would’ve beaten them without any problems. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I’ve lost my magic now. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My physical ability has declined considerably as well, so now I’m just a powerless civilian. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think this guy has anything decent.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“No, wait.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A boss-looking guy at the back cast a sharp glance at me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’ve got something valuable, don’t you?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">When I was kicked out by the hero party, I had no money with me, but I had some equipment remaining. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Anyone who looked would recognize them to be expensive magic products. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Since I lost my magic, they’re already useless for me, though. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, if there were a place where I could sell them, I would gain a considerable amount of cash. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Let’s take it from him and head to a town later. We won’t have any trouble getting booze and women for some time!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“That sounds nice!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The bandits raised a cry of joy. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──Don’t make me laugh. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A fierce anger boiled within my chest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My purpose is revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will not forgive Yuno and Irina, the ones who betrayed me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will not forgive the companions who betrayed me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will survive until I can pass judgement upon them. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will fight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Say, guys like you──Guh?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Heh, we’ll torture you until you’re on death’s door!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">One of the guys struck me, blowing me away. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It felt like all of the bones my body had cracked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps I received a fracture somewhere. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Not only had my body become thin, but perhaps my bones and organs have weakened as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hey hey, are you already dizzy from one punch?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“This guy’s too weak! Hahahaha!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I heard their sneers. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’m pathetically weak right now. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I would probably lose to even a child in a close-combat fight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What the…?! I felt something strange just now.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What, my body’s frozen…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Is this guy using magic?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The bandits glared at me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">With my skill, I’m dealing 3 units of ‘fixed damage’ every three seconds. </p>



<p class="calibre3">So, little by little, they’ll accumulate damage. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They won’t be brought to death with just one blow. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Time is key here. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Anyhow, I have to gain time and wait until the damage accumulates to a fatal amount. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“No, that’s not it.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke to myself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Buying time? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Should I run around until then? </p>



<p class="calibre3">That won’t work. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“That’s not the kind of power I’ve gained.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What are you mumbling?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The bandits once again rushed towards me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What I’ve obtained is a much more devastating power──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno’s and Irina’s figures floating in my mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I visioned them embracing each other while naked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina, the one who had supposedly vowed an eternal love to me, betrayed me and surrendered her chastity to Yuno. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno, the one who supposedly vowed to be my dear friend, snatched away Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Valery’s figure floated in my mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I had always respected him as a teacher of magic. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, he used and threw me away like I was a tool. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A sacrifice for magic. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte, Farrah, and Margo were the same. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──I thought they were my companions. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──I thought they were my friends. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Don’t…fool around with me…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The flames of anger morphed into a hell fire and burned within my chest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[A fine quality anger and hatred. Your hatred values are rising rapidly.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was the voice of the “darkness.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Damage of EX Skill ‘Fixed Damage’ has increased from 3 to 4.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Damage value has further risen from 4 to 5. Damage value has further──] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’ll raise it as much as I need to.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I glared at the bandits. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’ll get as angry as I need to.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah…hah…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">At last, one of the people in front of me coughed up blood and fell over. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Huh…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“H, hey…gah?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then another, and another. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Each person with the next-lowest amount of HP accumulated a fatal amount of damage and died. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, what…what are you…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The boss-looking guy, who was the only one remaining in the end, stepped back. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’re the sacrifices. The sacrifices to heighten the flames of my ‘darkness.'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I raised the corner of my mouth and smiled. </p>



<p class="calibre3">How pleasant. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You have my gratitude. As a reward──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The anger and hatred had become fuel for my power. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Now I’ve been given this opportunity. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Die.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah, guh, gya…ah…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Blood seeped out from the boss’ entire body, ending his life. </p>


<p><strong>4 &#8211; The First Step</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">Having annihilated the bandits, I proceeded through the trail. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“This body is too weak.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Each time I took a step, a pain rushed through the joints of my body. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that I had a bone fracture in my arm after being sent to the ground by that one bandit. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Once I get to a town, perhaps I should go to a church and have a monk heal me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[This is the influence of “Forbidden Arts ‘Chains of Despair.'” Your physical ability is much worse than the average human.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The voice of the “darkness” within me spoke. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Is there no way to recover?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[There’s only one way. What you lost was caused by Forbidden Arts. Your stamina and magic have been entirely converted into ‘light’ to strengthen the hero. So, if you take back that ‘light,’ what was lost will be restored.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“‘Light’…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[It should be with the hero now.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Yuno?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I frowned. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A surge of hatred relapsed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Haha, very good. Your damage value has risen to 8.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Though the value went up, it’s not enough to set out and beat Yuno. Though imperfect, he’s still a hero. Furthermore, each of his companions are top-notch people like a warrior, sage, or priest.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I sighed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“It seems I have no choice but to live with this weak body for now.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[The power of ‘darkness’ also holds skills such as ‘Flight’ and ‘Acceleration.’ If those manifest, you can move at a speed several times faster than a normal human.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The “darkness” explained as such. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Can they compensate for my physical ability?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke my mind to the “darkness.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[However, due to the effects of the curse, you cannot use them. At present, you can only use the skill ‘Fixed Damage.’] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…So in the end, there’s no hope.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Someday, if you have ‘subordinates’ to bestow skills to, perhaps they can compensate for what you lack.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Huh?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">[Actually, that will be explained later. Ah, the town is in sight.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">In response to what the “darkness” said, I looked forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Castle walls surrounded the town far ahead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">For the time being, I’ll rest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then, I’ll accumulate power. </p>



<p class="calibre3">No matter how many years it will take, I will definitely get my revenge on all of them. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will cultivate my “darkness.” </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">Two years have passed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">During that time, I faced many hardships and got involved in countless battles, but none of that matters now. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At last, I’ve obtained the overwhelming power to fulfill my goal. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The only way is forward.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I walked alone on a mountain trail. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A colony of ogres was just a bit ahead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It used to be a difficult place that I would avoid, even if I was in the hero party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">One ogre alone had a high amount of fighting power and stamina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">So if there were a swarm of them, they could become a brutal, out of control army. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Nobody would come near this place, I was the only one traversing. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A rustling noise came from the bushes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Three gigantic figures approached from ahead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The ogres are already here to visit me?”</p>



<p class="calibre3">They had muscular, light-green bodies. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They only wore a loincloth. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Each carried a club made from a log in their hands. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“How far away are they?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The moment I muttered as such, the number “20” appeared in the corner of my sight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seemed that it was exactly 20 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">This had to do with a secondary effect of my skill. </p>



<p class="calibre3">By thinking about it, I could see a display of the distance to my target. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Since the range of my skill is 10 meters, it won’t show its effects until I get closer. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Of course, all I had to do was move forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The ogres were a little confused when I showed no fear at all. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I slowly walked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In terms of physical ability, my leg strength is no different from that of the elderly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I moved forward, little by little. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I reduced the distance by 3 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I reduced the distance by 5 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I reduced the distance by 7 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I didn’t stop walking until I shortened my distance with the ogres to ten meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Immediately after… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Auooooooooooooon?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shrieks and cries of pain. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The three ogres transformed into numerous particles of light and instantly vanished. </p>



<p class="calibre3">No doubt, an instant kill. </p>



<p class="calibre3">If their HP is 9999 or less, they will die the moment the skill’s effect is activated. </p>



<p class="calibre3">[There are few monsters with over 9999 HP.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">The serene female voice spoke in my head. </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘Darkness.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s the being that resided inside me after Yuno and his crew betrayed me and left me to die two years prior.  </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s what has given me this EX Skill “Fixed Damage.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">What in the world is this thing? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps it’s an angel or devil, maybe a pseudo-personality caused by a skill. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I still don’t understand its true nature. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Well, its true nature doesn’t matter anyways. </p>



<p class="calibre3">All I want is power. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The “darkness” has given me that power. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I knew that as the darkness within me deepened, my damage value would increase, but that value has now reached the upper limit of 9999. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I had a fearsome skill that dealt 9999 damage every 3 seconds to enemies 10 meters around me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It would deal 9999 damage in the next 3 seconds, then 9999 more damage after another 3 seconds…and would continue dealing damage every 3 seconds. </p>



<p class="calibre3">There are roughly two types of targets for damage-dealing. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Beings that I recognize as enemies and hold killing intent towards belong to the first type. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Beings that hold malicious intent towards me belong to the other type. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Those are the two. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Malicious intent is seen as a desire to inflict wounds on me past a certain degree. </p>



<p class="calibre3">This “certain degree” can’t be quantified, so I don’t exactly know what it is. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Well, at least it doesn’t massacre innocent civilians. </p>



<p class="calibre3">If my ability had such indiscriminate killing, then I wouldn’t be able to set foot into human habitat ever again. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I began to walk forward once more. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Some more ogres came out, but they all vanished the moment they appeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Or, some would enter my attack range and disappear before I could see them. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thus, I crossed through the mountains while swarms of ogres disappeared as I walked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">There should be a town up ahead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">For the time being, I’ll find an inn. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At last, I can begin my revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will restore my energy. </p>


<p><strong>5 &#8211; The Revenge-Seeker And The Female Knight 1</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">Two years ago, Yuno received a “genuine hero’s holy sword, Arkweiss.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Under the protection of the great “light,” his swordsmanship had enough power to beat even the leading demonic beings with just one blow. </p>



<p class="calibre3">That was a result of the curse placed onto me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Wielding that sword, Yuno and his five companions, his lover and priest Irina, the magic-omnipotent sage Valery, the brawny warrior Riotte, the awe-inspiring swordswoman Farrah, and the righteous middle-aged knight Margo, took down the leaders together. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At the end of the bitter struggle, even the Demon Lord had been defeated. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s been half a year since that event. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno and his crew were regarded as the strongest party among those of the seven heroes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The six of them earned status, honor, and wealth. They were now living a life intoxicated by luxury and power. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">The town was full of liveliness. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Several people walked down the road with faces of delight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s probably because of the world returning to peace after the Demon Lord’s defeat. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I couldn’t overlook the touch of anxiety mixed in with their delight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Have you heard? Surviving demonic beings have appeared in a neighboring town.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If so, this town fall might under attack too…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Even with the Demon Lord dead, it seems that this world is still in danger…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I listened attentively to the gossip all around. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The world still hasn’t achieved complete peace. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Well, the hero Yuno and his companions will probably defeat the remnants of the Demon Lord’s army.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, they’re much smaller in size compared to the former Demon Lord’s army.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“When the need arises, Riotte will somehow take care of this area.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Hmm, a member of the “hero party,” they said. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Certainly, the power of Yuno and his crew is immense. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Especially the power of the hero who defeated the Demon Lord. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, that power is tainted with blood. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s a power achieved from their betrayal and sacrifice of me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Two years ago, when I had only just awakened to the “darkness,” it seems that his “light” had already reached a high level. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, what about now? </p>



<p class="calibre3">My “darkness” should already be high enough to surpass his “light.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’re no ‘hero,’ Yuno.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I muttered in a quiet voice. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Your life of luxury and power ends here. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“But…I can’t let you die so easily.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will inflict the same──no, a greater amount of despair and pain than what I suffered through. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Of course, the same goes for the other five. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s now time for me to carry out my revenge on everyone. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">The next morning, I left the town. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My first target is the warrior Riotte. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ll get my revenge on everyone sooner or later, but he’s the closest one. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The next closest one is Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Once I exact my revenge on Riotte, she’ll be second. </p>



<p class="calibre3">After that, I’m not as sure. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps I’ll head to Yuno’s location. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I also harbor quite the grudge against Valery, my former teacher, as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Or perhaps I’ll find Farrah, or maybe Margo… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Well, I’ll think about it after I bring down Riotte.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte is currently a duke and is engaged with the second princess of the Shadi Kingdom. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps he could be a minister, or maybe even a king in the future. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A big leap in life for a worthless warrior. </p>



<p class="calibre3">That reminds me, that guy said ‘Men have big dreams. I’ll be a king someday!’ before. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Unfortunately for you Riotte, your dream won’t come true. Forever.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I walked towards the duke’s territory. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">I was in an eastern district of the Shadi Kingdom. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In fact, a fifth of the kingdom’s land is a part of Riotte’s duke territory. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I set foot into that portion of the land. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My aim is Riotte’s castle. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ll get there in the shortest distance. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I headed through the main path, fueled by the desire for revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Afterwards, I came across a mountain trail. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hehehe, there’s no escape for you now.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Why don’t you think for a bit about the situation you’re in?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Give up and let us enjoy ourselves…hehe.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I heard a number of coarse voices. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Dozens of soldiers surrounded a single girl. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Don’t mess with me! Who are you guys?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">She was a girl with twin-tailed hairstyle that is red like a flame. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her slender body was equipped with a knight’s armor and helmet. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her beautiful face that conveyed a sense of determination had stiffened, and she challenged the many people alone. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that she’s quite skillful. With a sharp slash attack, she took down one soldier. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, she was outnumbered. </p>



<p class="calibre3">As the masses crowded around her, she slowly began losing stamina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Kyaa.” </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kxJZ3z6/8-Pow-Vj-Cg.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre3">Before long, her sword dropped to the floor, and the female knight collapsed onto the ground. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What a fine woman.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Let’s have a taste of her before we send her to the duke’s place.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hey, wouldn’t that be bad?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Well, it’ll be fine if nobody finds out.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The soldiers all simultaneously licked their lips. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Their nether regions swelled as if to make a display of their lust. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Tsk…vile creatures!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Oh-ho, strong-willed, aren’t you?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“We all had a fun time with your older sister as well, didn’t we?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The girl’s complexion changed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her blue eyes were dyed with anger. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“So you were the ones who had my sister──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The circumstances were just right. It was after she had been ‘exploited’ by Riotte.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“She didn’t have the face of an innocent maiden anymore by that point, hehehe. She started willingly swinging her hips halfway into it.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hey hey, that’s because you forced her to do that. That woman resisted up until the very end.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I, I won’t forgive you…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While shedding tears, the female knight got up while staggering. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Absolutely not…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Picking up her sword, the girl mustered up the last of her spirit. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What can you do when you’re that tired? Take this!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Kyaa.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps already losing her energy, one of the soldiers managed to kick her down, and she again fell to the floor. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that she could no longer get up. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hehehehehe…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">They surrounded the girl while making a laughter dense with lust. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s only a matter of time before they defile the girl in accordance to their desires. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Since they’re blocking the road, I suppose I can’t really leave this matter alone. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──Just hold tight, help is on the way. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I headed towards them in a straight line. </p>



<p class="calibre3">That being said, my physical ability fell behind considerably compared to fellow young people. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My hands and feet were weak, and I was pretty much like an old person. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s frustrating that it takes so much time for me to move. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My skill from the darkness is unrivalled, but its range is only 10 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thereupon… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What the, there’s a guy coming this way.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">One of the soldiers turned around and noticed me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Release that woman. Lowlifes.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke as if repulsed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Huh?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hey hey, do you know who you’re picking a fight with?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Listen up, we are Duke Riotte’s subordinates, got it?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Place both of your hands onto the ground and apologize at once. If not, we’ll take care of you first before we have our fun with this woman.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The soldiers smirked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Their smiles turned from those of sexual excitement to those of bloodlust. </p>



<p class="calibre3">These people really are lowlifes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Leaving that aside, did they say Duke Riotte? </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then, these guys are his henchmen? </p>



<p class="calibre3">──They’re lowlifes, just like him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A dark flame kindled within the recesses of my heart. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I further reduced the distance. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Heh, you’re not going to run away?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“It’s like you want us to kill you by coming closer.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“His movements are pretty slow, aren’t they? Isn’t this our win?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“We can have our fun with the women, but there isn’t anything we can do with the men. Kill him.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The soldiers were in high spirits. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Right then, I had reduced the distance between us to ten meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Immediately following… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah?! Aah…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gyaaaaah….?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">With the sound of shrieks, the soldiers near me each began turning into particles of light and disappeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3">EX Skill “Fixed Damage”. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A “darkness” skill designed for annihilation, inflicting 9999 damage every 3 seconds to enemies within ten meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">For small fries, I can just make them vanish by approaching them. </p>



<p><strong>7 &#8211; The Revenge-Seeker And The Female Knight 2</strong></p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, what is this…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The remaining soldiers raised voices of confusion. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Rather than fear, it seemed more like they couldn’t comprehend what happened. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I casually walked forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Though my stride was frail, my opponents’ legs were frozen in fear. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was able to easily close the gap. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gyaah…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Each of the soldiers within 10 meters of me cried in agony as they vanished. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, who…are you…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The bewilderment of the remaining knights had now turned into fear. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Disappear.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I took another step forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The remaining knights vanished without being able to scream. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Are you alright?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I called out to the girl who had collapsed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You are?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">She looked up at me with a stunned expression. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She slowly got up, using her sword to support herself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Thank you. I am Shea Framwright.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The girl named Shea politely bowed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She seems to be about seventeen years old. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her knight’s armor and helmet were quite chipped, but when looking closely, I could tell that they were top quality. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I gave her my name. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I kept my last name a secret for the time being. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“U, um, could it be that you killed those soldiers back there with your magic?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Magic…you say?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I lightly sighed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I lost all of my magic on that fateful day two years ago. </p>



<p class="calibre3">All I have now is this “darkness” skill. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, I didn’t feel like giving such a drawn-out explanation. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Something like that.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I gave a concise answer. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Um…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea once again spoke to me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her tone of voice was stronger than before. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I have one request. Could you listen to what I have to say?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“A request…what is it?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Actually──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea suddenly went down on her knees. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She looked up at me with vigor while kneeling on the ground. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that she has her circumstances. </p>



<p class="calibre3">※ </p>



<p class="calibre3">-Shea’s Side- </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sister…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea Framwright was frozen in shock while in front of her older sister’s corpse. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seemed that she had suffered an immeasurable amount of torture. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She suffered the violence of Duke Riotte and his henchmen, and was deprived of her dignity as a woman and as a human. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her tidy and beautiful face was warped with fear. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her limbs were bent in the wrong direction, she was covered in blood. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Agh…uuh….aaah….” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea threw up right then and there. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She kept throwing up until she had emptied the contents of her stomach. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The figure of her older sister remained in her mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her sister had raised Shea like a parent when losing both parents early on in life. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She was a gentle, brave beauty. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She was intelligent, had skill with the sword, and was active within the Kingdom’s chivalric order. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Have a year ago, she was scouted by Duke Riotte and worked as the leader of his knights. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She had been proud of her sister. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea kept crying until she ran out of tears. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Blood fell onto her sister’s face from her biting her lip. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It formed a red streak, as if it were a falling tear. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I will never forgive him…I’ll kill him…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">After that, only a hatred and desire for revenge towards Riotte remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">※ </p>



<p class="calibre3">“──I’m looking for revenge against Duke Riotte.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While kneeling in front of me, Shea had explained her circumstances. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I suppose it’s revenge on behalf of my sister.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ve got the gist of her story. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea’s older sister was working as the leader of the duke’s knights. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The duke, Riotte, basically indulged himself in gold and women while charging heavy taxes on the citizens. </p>



<p class="calibre3">His greed knows no end, how expected. </p>



<p class="calibre3">When Shea’s older sister criticized him for that, Riotte was angered. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He and his henchmen then tortured her in all sorts of ways before finally killing her. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea vowed to get revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">During that time, Riotte noticed Shea’s beauty and sent his henchmen to have her for himself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She refused Riotte’s offer and fought with the sword and armor her sister left behind. </p>



<p class="calibre3">And it seems that was when I showed up. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“So, what’s your request?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I asked Shea. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Well, I’ve a guess at what it is, though. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Please lend me your power so that I can take revenge for my sister.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea glared right at me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You want to kill the duke?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riotte is protected by many soldiers, and he’s a veteran warrior as well. It’s not possible to face him upfront, but perhaps an assassination could work…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke as such. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The opponent holds absolute power in this region. Sneaking into the mansion won’t be easy either. With your power, perhaps we could mange…so what do you say, will you lend your cooperation?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea suddenly placed her head against the floor while saying that. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I can repay you with whatever you desire. Even if it takes me years, even if it takes an entire lifetime…I can surely face the duke with that power from just before.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thinking about in terms of common sense, it was no different from asking a stranger for help. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s not the kind of thing one would normally ask. </p>



<p class="calibre3">No matter how much of a reward one would receive, challenging the opponent who “holds absolute power in this region” would be foolish. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Surely, Shea is aware of what she’s asking as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She’s desperate. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She’s grasping at straws. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“──A desire for revenge, was it?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I set foot into this household in order to get revenge on Riotte, and now I’ve happened to come across someone with a similar will for revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A strange coincidence, is it not? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Alright.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I quickly replied. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I suppose you’d refuse. I’m sorry. Giving such a sudden request is──huh?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea was flabbergasted about halfway into her sentence. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Huh? Huh? Just now──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Yeah, I’ll cooperate.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“R, really?! You would be facing a duke, furthermore one of the members from the world’s strongest hero party, you know?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You were the one who asked.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’m just surprised that you accepted it so quickly…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Well then, would you rather that I refuse?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Either way, my goal is to get Riotte. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Whether or not I listen to her request is irrelevant. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“N, nonononono, thank you very much.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea frantically swung her head to the side. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She then suddenly went silent. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What’s the matter?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“──Could it be?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">She had scornful eyes for some reason. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’re going to demand for my body in return?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Why did she jump to that? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Men are all monsters. My older sister said that they always want to make women their thing.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea stressed that. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Not all of them are like that.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“They’re basically lustful devils who only think about making women theirs.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I feel like you have a prejudiced view of men.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…What a relief. Look, Sister. I will definitely get revenge, and then your spirit will be at peace.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">She muttered as if praying, and then bowed her head towards me again. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Um, err…I’m sorry for the rude things I said.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I don’t mind.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that Shea’s the type who holds a lot of deep prejudices. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Thank you, Chrome.” </p>


<p><strong>6 &#8211; The Beginning</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">I’ll continue to do my best~! </p>



<p class="calibre3">My aim is to lure out the guy ahead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“That guy has absolute confidence in his power. He was already overconfident to begin with, but it’s even worse now that he became a great noble of the Shadi Kingdom.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I explained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If a commoner were to oppose a great noble like him, he will try to torture and kill him with a large number of soldiers to serve as a lesson. He would step out as well and try to torture me. Just to satisfy his violent tendencies.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">That’s what I’m after. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My skill has a short range. </p>



<p class="calibre3">For instance, if my opponent shuts himself in a solid building, I can’t lay a hand on him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">So, I’ll just have him come to me instead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Well, it’s not that difficult. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He’s the simplest and most easily provoked person within the former hero party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He loves to make a display of his power as well. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“He’ll definitely fall for it.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Um…if that’s the case, then use me as a decoy. If we manage to lure him out, then I think you’ve got a chance.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke while placing a hand over her chest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Decoy, you say?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riotte was trying to get me to his side. If push comes to shove, I can guarantee mutual destruction──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“That’s impossible.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I plainly spoke in response to Shea’s tragic but brave resolution. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Indeed, Shea’s quite competent after seeing that battle just before. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, even though he’s been inactive, Riotte is still a former member of the hero party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">There’s a huge gap in their ability. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that he’s been living a self-indulgent life after becoming a duke, so perhaps he’s not as self-restrained as he used to be during his past as a warrior. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Even so, I don’t think Shea’s a match for him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The tables will be turned on you, you’ll end up becoming his plaything.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“P, plaything…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea’s face turned pale. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She shuddered. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’d rather bite my tongue and die than be defiled by that man!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">How courageous. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry. I’ll kill him.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I said that and walked forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“No need for a decoy.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Chrome…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riotte’s castle is over there, right?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I pointed West and asked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Right, but…um, what are you doing?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I already told you, I’m luring him out.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I continued ahead without waiting for Shea. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My thin legs were weak, but I moved. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I continued walking. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’m going to kill him. I’ll take the shortest distance. A straight line.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Now then, let the revenge begin. </p>



<p class="calibre3">※ </p>



<p class="calibre3">-Riotte’s Side- </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hey, I’m out of booze! Bring some more!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte angerly shouted to a nearby servant. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was as if he was criticizing him for not having prepared a fresh supply of alcohol before it ran out. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He got angry over how useless his servant seemed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Y, yes, right away…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What a useless guy. Alright, off with that man’s head.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“B, but Duke, we can’t deprive him of his livelihood so easily…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">A butler was flustered. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“He has a newly wed wife who will give birth to a child soon──” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Don’t you get it?! He deserves to die after making me lose my temper. After offending me, Riotte, a member of the glorious hero party!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte smiled while making a vulgar laugh. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If you’d like, how about I get rid of you instead of that guy? There are countless people who can take your place.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Eek, please forgive me…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Then, go tell that guy that he’s being beheaded.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…I understand.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What’s with that attitude?! Are you displeased?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte suddenly got into a rage and threw the glass he held towards the butler. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The glass hit him directly on the forehead. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ooh, p, please excuse my rudeness.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The butler’s forehead started bleeding, and he went down on his hands and knees. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He apologized to Riotte while placing his head over the floor. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Please, I offer my humblest apologies…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The butler knew very well what would happen if he angered him anymore than he already did. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In fact, the previous butler had been killed after angering him during a feast. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He was able to hush it using his influence. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Well, whatever. I’ll let you off just this once. Oh right, go investigate criminals. It’ll affect my reputation if I leave them alone.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">He sent the butler out of his room, as if to shoo him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He then stared at a girl working as a waitress. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Oh.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte narrowed his eyes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She wore a maid dress that was modified to be more revealing in accordance to his tastes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She was naturally a beauty. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte didn’t distinguish between married and unmarried women, he didn’t care if they already had lovers. He collected beautiful women and had them serve him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">…Like Shea, some of them refused Riotte’s summons, though. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Hey, you over there…entertain me for a bit. Let’s head to the bedroom.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte stared at the maid’s face and figure as if licking her. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Err, um…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Looking at you closely, you’ve got quite the nice body, don’t you? Let’s get busy.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Nobody could oppose him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Their lives were at his whim. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He was like a king. </p>



<p class="calibre3">No, he was the king in this region of the kingdom. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“P, please spare me…aah…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While reeking of alcohol, he embraced the maid who began to protesting. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Her strength couldn’t match that of Riotte, who was a veteran warrior. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Perhaps giving up, she soon stopped resisting. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I like them best when they’re obedient. Let’s have some fun now, hehehe.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte forcibly dragged the her to the bedroom. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He shut the door close, and the sad screams of a women echoed inside the room. </p>



<p class="calibre3">※ </p>



<p class="calibre3">I walked in a straight line towards the duke residence where Riotte lived. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea and I wore cloaks and hoods that masked our eyes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A simple disguise to hide our identities. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“U, um, is this okay?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea walked beside me with a face of uncertainty. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Even if we lure Riotte out, we would be facing him upfront.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Indeed, when thinking about it with common sense, it seemed like a reckless decision. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, my ability is the exact opposite of common sense. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I already said that we would take the shortest distance.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke bluntly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She’s only seen my ability once, but I’ve using this EX Skill for two years. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’m absolutely confident. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Nobody will stop me, no matter who it is. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thereupon… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Who are you?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Duke Riotte’s residence is beyond this point! This is not a place for wanderers like you to trespass!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Leave at once!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Several soldiers approached from tens of meters away. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems that they’re guards patrolling the area. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If you continue, we won’t show mercy!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The other day, I’ve torn the limbs off of a guy who wandered here. Just to teach the people a lesson.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Do we have to make you suffer through the same thing in order to preserve the duke’s influence? Hmm?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Are they exercising power and violence under Riotte? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Lowlifes.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While judging that, I continued forward without a care. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Did you not hear us…? Gah?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Gah?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Guah…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">As soon as the distance between us reached the range of the skill, the soldiers spat out blood and fell. </p>



<p class="calibre3">一Regular knights would have a stamina value of about 100 to 300. </p>



<p class="calibre3">For someone of the hero class like Riotte, they would have 1000, 2000, or even more. </p>



<p class="calibre3">There’s no way these guys would have values that high. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They all died instantly after receiving a fixed damage of 9999. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Chrome…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea was breathless in response to the gruesome scene. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If you’re scared, then don’t bother coming along. I’ll go alone.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“N, no, I’m going with you!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke courageously despite her pale face. </p>



<p><strong>8 &#8211; Confrontation and Revenge </strong></p>



<p class="calibre3">-Riotte’s SIde- </p>



<p class="calibre3">“An intruder?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte knitted his brows. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Dispatch the guards.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, well…everyone who approached him has died. He might be using some kind of magic!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The commanding officer of the guards spoke with a pale face. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Hmm.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte’s expression tensed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Though he had continued living a self-indulgent lifestyle, and though he had been less active, he was still a member of the hero party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">His face returned to that of the tough “warrior Riotte” from when he had been active. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I guess I’ll take a look. You guys, follow me.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Picking up a large sword that was leaning against the wall, Riotte headed out from his room. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It has been a while since he had the spirit to face an opponent. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte thought that it would do well for him to personally execute the intruder, since it would also serve as a warning to others. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, what is that?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Once Riotte arrived at the scene, he muttered while flabbergasted. </p>



<p class="calibre3">More than a hundred guards surrounded a man and woman. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They were about 100 meters away, and he couldn’t see their facial features, but they both seemed young. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The man walked forward casually while the woman followed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then, the knights he got near successively spat blood and collapsed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Just like what had been reported, it seemed to be the work of magic. </p>



<p class="calibre3">No ordinary curse would cause death just by coming close. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“However, I have this man cornered.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte tightly grasped a pendant he wore over his chest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘The Demon Sealing Crest, Barrier Crest.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was a treasured tool that could render poison, paralysis, and all “status abnormalities” invalid. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It also possessed both physical and magic defense and will continue to offer protection until 30000 accumulated damage. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was something that the hero party obtained before the battle against the Demon Lord. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was also effective against spells, as no matter how high of a level it was, even if it was a spell cast by the ranks of a Demon Lord, it had the power to repel it. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nCB44hT/9-2n99-XF1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre3">Its effective range was 20 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I don’t know what kind of magic you’re using, but it doesn’t matter.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte stepped forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">If he could seal off magic, then it would turn into a sword fight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Such a thin man would be no match for a top-class warrior like himself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’ll slice you to pieces…no, I’ll cut off your limbs and keep you barely alive, then I’ll have my way with that woman over there.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">His lust was apparent. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The lower-half of his body fired up just from his imagination. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Out of the way, all of you. I’ll be the one to kill him!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">After issuing a command to the soldiers, Riotte appeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Since his belly was a bit bloated from gaining weight, his movements were sluggish, but the power he had in the past was still there. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“There’s no running away now, intruder. Wallow in regret, for you’ve committed the crime of trespassing onto the territory of me, Duke Riotte.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">After saying that, he recognized the young woman next to the man. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Oh, is that you, Shea?! The impertinent woman who refused my invitation! I’ll definitely have some fun with you in front of that man!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riotte…! My sister’s enemy…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">She had a pale face and stared at him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She had an expression full of resentment. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte had thoroughly torment her beloved older sister, violated her, made a plaything for his subordinates, and made her suffer through endless disgrace before killing her. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Surely, you must hate me.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Feelings of joy welled up within him when he thought such a woman surrendering. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Then something happened the moment Riotte’s desires reached their peak. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">[Warning.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[9999 damage has been received.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[This crest will be destroyed after receiving 20001 more damage.] </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">A warning message appeared on the crest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, wha…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seemed that an attack had appeared out of nowhere. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Neither the man nor Shea had exhibited any behavior though. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, what was more important to him was… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Impossible, 9999 damage in an instant…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte froze from shock. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">[Warning.] </p>



<p class="calibre3">[9999 damage has been received.]  </p>



<p class="calibre3">[This crest will be destroyed after receiving 10002 more damage.]  </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">After several more seconds, another warning message appeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What…what’s happening…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte’s confusion intensified. </p>



<p class="calibre3">His confusion soon turned into fear. </p>



<p class="calibre3">That fear didn’t come from logic, but from instinct. </p>



<p class="calibre3">From that man. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The man in front of him had a strange power that could deal damage. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What kind of person are you…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte spoke in a panic. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Who…are you?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">※ </p>



<p class="calibre3">The day has finally arrived. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’ve been waiting for the day we meet again…Riotte.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">After the distance between us was 10 meters, I calmly stared at the man in front of me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I lowered the hood that had been covering the upper-half of my face. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“And you are…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte blinked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seemed that he didn’t know who I was. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Indeed, my appearance has changed compared to how I looked two years ago. </p>



<p class="calibre3">None of my black hair remained, it was all silver. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My limbs were thin and the aura of my body had changed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Above all else were my eyes. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I knew it myself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My eyes were marked impure with a bloodlust and desire for revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A crack then emerged in the amulet the man had. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Could it be…Chrome…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte’s spoke with a panicked voice and the face of complete shock. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At last, it seemed that he understood who I was. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“And here I thought that you forgot about your former companion, but…I’m glad that you remember me, Riotte.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke apathetically. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I didn’t feel as furious as I thought I would be. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I found it strange myself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Did my desire for revenge become so excessive that it withered? </p>



<p class="calibre3">For a moment, I began doubting myself. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, in the next instant… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riooooooooooootte!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I yelled. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The anguish, fury, pain, and despair from when I was betrayed two years ago… </p>



<p class="calibre3">I concentrated all of it into my screaming. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It didn’t wither away. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It’s just that my desire for vengeance was so huge that it took a while for all of it to come out. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“E, eek…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte sank to the floor in face of my overwhelming spirit. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At the same time, the amulet he wore shattered into pieces. </p>


<p><strong>9 &#8211; Settling Things With a Former Friend</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">“Let me tell you something first. My power ‘inflicts fixed damage to targets within its effective range.'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Fixed…damage…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seemed that Riotte sank to the floor, unable to get up. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Its damage value is ‘9999’. That thing you had was the ‘Demon Sealing Crest, Barrier Crest’, right? A treasured tool for protection of the highest degree, but now it’s gone.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Indeed, the effective range of the “Demon Sealing Crest” is the 20 meters. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It seems within that range, the amulet came into contact with my skill and received damage. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“N, no way, I’ve never heard of…that kind of skill.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The fact that your treasured tool broke is proof.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke coldly to the frightened Riotte. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ough….” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’ll say it again. The damage value is ‘9999’. The moment you get within the range of my skill, you’ll be assaulted by that amount of damage.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Oooough….” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte’s face turned pale. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The brave warrior of the hero party, who challenged a hundred demons by himself, was pale. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Such a highly praised savior like Riotte stood before a power of absolute “death”. </p>



<p class="calibre3">──Are you experiencing a bit of the fear and despair I felt back then, Riotte? </p>



<p class="calibre3">I dark joy rose out from the core of my heart. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I wonder if the grand warrior Riotte of the hero party can withstand this.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“D, don’t be stupid! Even the Demon Lord’s top subjects would die from 9999 damage if they’re not careful! They’d die! They’d absolutely die…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Well then, when you get within range, it’ll be your final moment.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I walked leisurely towards him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Step by step. Let fear strike within you each time I take a step, Riotte. Cry out loud. Raise a scream.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“D, don’t…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I hope you can feel despair, just like I did on that fateful day.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“D, don’t come closer…don’t come closer!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte frantically retreated. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Weak in the knees, he walked faintly, unbefitting of his title as a brave veteran warrior. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“All of you, what are you doing?! Shoot an arrow at him!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thereupon, he issued an order to the soldiers behind him. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Protect the duke!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The guards all readied an arrow into their bows. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A barrage of countless arrows rained upon me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Shea, don’t leave my side.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke to the girl beside me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“If you move away, you’ll die.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“O, okay.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea grabbed my sleeve. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Immediately following, the horde of arrows approached me. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">Then, they all disappeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">“What…?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte’s eyes widened in shock. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I thought I said it before. My skill inflicts ‘fixed damage to targets within its effective range.'” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I spoke proudly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Those ‘targets’ aren’t limited to just humans. Anything that tries to harm me, whether they be arrows or magic, will all be dealt with in the same way. Well, if your arrows are able to withstand 9999 damage, then perhaps they would be able to hurt me.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“D, damn it, all of you, Attack him with your swords! Do whatever you can to protect me!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte shrieked. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“B, but…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, well, if we get close to him, we’ll definitely die…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, the guards were hesitant. </p>



<p class="calibre3">After seeing my offense and defense now, that would be the natural reaction. </p>



<p class="calibre3">They would lose their lives as soon as they entered the effective range of my skill. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Oough…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The guards retreated with pale faces. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You all…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riotte, it doesn’t seem that anybody here wants to put their life on the line for your sake.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I continued walking further. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A value floating in my vision, reading the distance to my target. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The number was “18.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I suppose that in 8 meters, the effect will activate. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Killing Riotte instantly isn’t my intention. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’ll make him suffer bit-by-bit under the fear and despair. </p>



<p class="calibre3">17 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I continued walking slowly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“What will you do, Riotte? Will you face me like the warrior you are?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“N, no…I took great pains to beat the Demon Lord, earn status, honor, and fortune…and now it’s going to end so soon…no…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte swung his head left and right while quivering. </p>



<p class="calibre3">16 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“S, spare me…spare me…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte went down on his hands and knees. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He placed his head against the floor and pleaded. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Forgive me! N, no, please forgive me, Chrome!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Begging for your life?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">15 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I slowly closed the distance with Riotte. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I purposely stopped myself from heading towards him briskly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Each step I took was a countdown to his death. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I have to make him fully aware of his crime. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The massive crime of betraying me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I always thought of you as a companion.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">14 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Chrome…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“And I thought of you as a friend.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">13 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I thought of you dearly. I wanted to protect you all…even if it mean risking my life. After all, my ultimate motive was the defeat of the Demon Lord.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I reflected on the thoughts I once harbored. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I was full of self-admonition. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Saving the world, what foolish talk. But I believed in it if it meant protecting the dear companions closest to me. So I fought. I summoned the courage to face countless tough demons.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">12 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“However, I was trampled on.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I bit my lip until blood gushed out. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I felt a stinging pain, but that didn’t matter. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“On that very day, all the thoughts I had cherished the most were lost. I was empty.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">11 meters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“W, wait! R, right, I was against it! I said that I didn’t want to go through with doing such a cruel thing to a lifelong friend! But Yuno and the others forced me…so what happened back then wasn’t of my own will! B, believe me…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Riotte raised a cry of panic. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“It’s too late. There’s no way such a convenient story would pass.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I sneered. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Well, it’s only a matter of time before he gets within range of the skill’s effect. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“After you all abandoned me, I thought that I was going to die. However, something inside me screamed that it couldn’t end like this. I had to settle things.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I looked down at Riotte. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“P, p, please….please spare meeeeeeee….!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">He seemed to have sensed that he would die if I got just 1 meter closer. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He pleaded while his face was full of tears and mucus. </p>



<p class="calibre3">His nether regions were wet and steamy. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Did he lose control over his bladder from the fear? </p>



<p class="calibre3">None his pride or fighting spirit remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">No, perhaps he didn’t have such things from the very beginning. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Thinking about the lustful, self-indulgent “Duke Riotte,” that’s definitely his true nature. </p>



<p class="calibre3">A miserable end for the supposedly daring warrior Riotte of the hero party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“H, hey, we’re companions, right…? That was just, um, an illusion! You were possessed by an evil spirit! Please spare me…spare meeeee…!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">──The words my companions said that very day flashed into my mind. </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">‘Everyone decided on this.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘To strengthen the hero.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘You’re the sacrifice.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘Everyone wants to survive.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘Don’t worry, she’ll make me happy.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3">‘Sorry, Chrome. I won’t forget you.’ </p>



<p class="calibre3"><br class="calibre4" /></p>



<p class="calibre3">I took a step forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">50 centimeters remained. </p>



<p class="calibre3">One more step. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I thought of you as a companion too.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I stared at Riotte once again. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My former companion. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My former friend. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, now… </p>



<p class="calibre3">Now… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“But not anymore.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I took a step forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He reached the range of the skill’s effect. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The Riotte who had been my companion, the one who was rough but I had fond memories of…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Guh, geh, aaaaaah…aaah…aah….!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">With a shriek and the spewing of blood, he soon disappeared. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“No longer exists.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">And so, I was one step closer to finishing my revenge. </p>


<p><strong>10 &#8211; Departure</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">I was on top of a small hill with Shea. </p>



<p class="calibre3">There was a tomb made of stone. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The name engraved on the tombstone read “Ria Framwright”. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was the tomb of Shea’s older sister. </p>



<p class="calibre3">She offered a flower in front of the tomb. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Sister, Chrome here has avenged you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">She smiled in front of the tomb. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Please be at peace…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Transparent tears ran down her cheek. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The wind blew through her scarlet hair. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I also offered a silent prayer. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Thank you, Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea turned around and politely bowed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“With this, my sister’s soul is at peace.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Good for her.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">My mouth eased up just a tiny bit. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I thought I was going to smile, but it didn’t end up turning out that way. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Um, could I give you my thanks?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke as such. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’m not sure what I think about that.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I’m perplexed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I’ve only been doing this carry out my revenge. Besides, there’s somewhere I have to go soon.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Go…?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“There are still remaining members of the hero party who backstabbed me. There are five left, and my journey is not over until I get my revenge on each and every one of them.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Right, Riotte was just the beginning. </p>



<p class="calibre3">My journey of revenge has just begun. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“By everyone…don’t tell me that you mean to oppose the hero?!” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke with a face of surprise. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Of course I do.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I raised the corner of my mouth. </p>



<p class="calibre3">This time, I was able to smile adequately. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The hero Yuno. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The saint Irina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The sage Valery. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The swordswoman Farrah. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The knight Margo. </p>



<p class="calibre3">I will make those remaining five taste endless fear and despair…! </p>



<p class="calibre3">Just thinking about it made a dark joy rise within me. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Then, I will accompany you, Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea leaned forward. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You may need some help during your journey. That’ll be my thanks to you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…Do you even comprehend what you’re saying? I plan to challenge the world’s strongest hero party.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“When I vowed to get revenge on Riotte, I assumed that I would die in the process.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke coldly. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“However, thanks to you, I’m alive. So, I’d like to use what’s left of my life for you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’re too immature. Why don’t you go find your own happiness from here on out?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Oh, but aren’t you quite young yourself, Chrome?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“That’s not what I mean.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">While I had a bitter expression, Shea smiled for some reason. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I want to be with you. Just a little longer.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“…With me, you say?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I frowned. </p>



<p class="calibre3">What’s going on inside that head of hers? </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Strange woman.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ha ha, this may be rude of me to say, but I think that you’re quite the oddball as well.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea spoke with a playful tone. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Is that so?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Indeed.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea kept smiling. </p>



<p class="calibre3">However, her pupils harbored a firm, strong will. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Besides, despite how I look, my older sister, the leader of the knight group, taught me the basics of the sword. I’ve also trained my body, so you won’t be able to shake me off with your leg strength, right Chrome? No matter what, I’ll chase after you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Give me a break…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">I sighed. </p>



<p class="calibre3">At this rate, she’ll follow me around despite my objections. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“The moment things get too excessive, we stop travelling together. That’s my condition.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Thank you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Shea nodded her head with a grin. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Now then, let’s have a pleasant journey. Chrome.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I don’t care if it’s pleasant or not.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">The path I follow will be one tainted with blood. </p>



<p class="calibre3">After all, this is a journey of revenge. </p>



<p class="calibre3">※ </p>



<p class="calibre3">-Yuno’s Side- </p>



<p class="calibre3">Rufus Kingdom, imperial capital. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In the heart of the city stood the residence of the dedicated hero, Yuno. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It was a luxurious palace that could compete with an emperor’s castle. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Riotte is…dead?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno was dumbfounded by the report. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He couldn’t believe that the brawny Riotte had died. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In the party, he could always tear a cut into anybody with his strong sword and tough stamina. </p>



<p class="calibre3">In private, he had a few violent areas, but he looked as if he was a caring, fine fellow. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ah, to think that would happen…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno bit his lip in response to the death of his companion and friend. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Afterwards, he received a report about what was known so far. </p>



<p class="calibre3">It appeared that the perpetrator was someone who bore a grudge against the hero party. </p>



<p class="calibre3">The information still seemed to be shrouded in mystery, so the information wasn’t exactly accurate though… </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Ah, to think that Riotte would die…” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina, who was beside him, wept. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“He was such a good person, why?” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“You’re not alone…I’m sad about it as well, Irina.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno embraced his fiancee. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“He might be after us as well.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina spoke with a pale face. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Yuno…please protect me.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“Of course. If the one who killed Riotte assaults us, I’ll stop him.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Yuno gave a clear smile. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He then kissed Irina’s flower-like lips. </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I am the strongest hero in the world, Yuno. This holy sword has slain even the Demon Lord. Don’t worry.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">“I trust you.” </p>



<p class="calibre3">Irina looked up at him in delight. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He embraced his beautiful fiancee once more. </p>



<p class="calibre3">(If he goes after Irina or me, I will definitely defend against him.) </p>



<p class="calibre3">The flames of a fighting spirit burned within Yuno’s chest. </p>



<p class="calibre3">Having defeated the Demon Lord, he had been known as a savior across the entire world. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He obtained honor, wealth, and a beautiful fiancee by his side. </p>



<p class="calibre3">He felt the peak of happiness each day. </p>



<p class="calibre3">(I won’t let anybody destroy this life.) </p>



<p class="calibre3">He would not forgive anyone who attempted to face him. </p>
