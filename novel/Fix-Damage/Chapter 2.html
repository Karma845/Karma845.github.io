<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Darkness and the Saintess</h3>

<p><strong>1 &#8211; Saint Irina</strong></p>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"──Then, thank you very much. Supreme Priest-sama."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">In a dim dark bedroom, Irina Valim smiled at an elderly man.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She was tired of being asked for her body immediately after returning to the Kingdom of Ralpha, but for now she can't help offend him.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina's future career was essentially determined by his will.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Fufufu, leave it to me. I enjoyed such a wonderful body. I cannot help to not fulfill your wishes."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Thank you very much."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina bowed and kissed the elder priest reverently.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Kissing someone who didn't have a piece of affection was a familiar thing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Slowly released her lips, and Irina quickly wore her saintess robe.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Batan!</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">At that time, the door of that bedroom was violently opened.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Irina!"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A man broke in while shouting.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A knight in glittering armor.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">He was a young man in his mid-twenties with a beautiful face.</span></div>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1R7qV3x/11-3-M2f3-MD.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The name was Barnez.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">He was one of the Holy Knights that guarding Irina.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"It's a lie, right...... you&nbsp;sleep with such an old man......!?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Barnez moaned, alternating looked at between her and the Supreme Priest.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina was already wearing her saintess robe, but the high priest had still exposed his massive fat naked.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">At first glance, it was clear what was going on here.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"What the hell are you! That's rude!"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The high priest exclaimed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">But Barnez&nbsp;didn't flinch, staring at Irina and the Supreme Priest.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Why, Irina! Didn't we love each other!"</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"What is it, that you've said?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina frowned.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14"><i class="calibre6">(By all, why he is coming at such a timing)</i></span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">There was no doubt that he might be the high-tier holy knight, But she didn't expect him to break into the supreme priest's private bedroom.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She thought he was a more sensible man──.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Getting jealous, it was such a thing that men do.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She sighed inside.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Hey, Irina. What the hell exactly is this?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Staring at her and Barnez&nbsp;alternately as the priest was puzzled.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Please help me, Supreme Priest. He has been approaching me for a long time."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina instantly created a scenario in her head and spoke in a weak voice.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">While expressing the expression of<i class="calibre6"> "A woman who is troubled by being accused"</i>,</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"But, I've rejected him, and he being crazy──."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"I see. So it is one-sided love huh."</span></div>

<div class="calibre15">
<div class="calibre4">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The Supreme Priest snorted.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Go away, brat. Irina is my woman."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"What, what you said...?!?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"As you can see, we have already in a relationship between man and woman. We've deeply connected, both physically and mentally. There's no room for such a brat."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Irina, are you just playing with me!? That day, Is the word of love you've whispered in bed that day all lies?!"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Barnez shouted appallingly.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina looked at him coldly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Why is men so simple and pathetic at all?</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">We had slept once or twice, and you were exclaiming to be a lover of this Saintess Irina.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Oh... Supreme Priest-sama, please protect me."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina, with a sad expression, she rushed to the Supreme Priest's hug.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Even such a lie ... As if trying to impress this me like a slut!"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She showed tears of acting.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Which one shall I believe?&nbsp;</span>It's ridiculous."</div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The Supreme priest was completely fooled and then cast a spell.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"[Mindwave]!"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A spell that interfered with the mind and causes pain.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Ga ... ha ...!?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Barnez, who got hit directly, collapsed on the spot.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Haa~, haa~, haa~ ..."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">While shedding sweat, that Holy Knight glanced at him.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The priest looked back at him,</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"I'll say only once. Get out."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Sh, shit ...!"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Barnez vomiting resentment, ran away.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">--</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Then, please excuse me."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina closed the door and left the room.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Despite the unexpected incident of Barnez's intrusion, she got it right.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The witness of the Supreme Priest was also good.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">It was a reasonable result.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Soon, Irina would be nominated as the next Supreme Priest.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">This was the first time for a woman to be one.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She defeated the Demon King as a member of the Hero party, and her neat and beautiful appearance was very popular.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The cult would not leave her like that.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">But the last push was necessary.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">So Irina offered her body to that man ──the present supreme priest.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Although she was betraying her lover, Yuno, but she didn't mind.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Women's weapons were a principle of active use.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She approached Yuno in the first place because she had abandoned her former lover, Chrome.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">That because, he couldn't lead herself to the heights she wanted.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14"><i class="calibre6">(I... I'll go up further, up to the peak of the world's power)</i></span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">--</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Irina-sama, the results of the investigation have arrived."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">One girl came to Irina.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A young promising priestess with strong religion and magic.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She was said to be a high priest in the future, and was a close associate of Irina.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Please take it to me"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She gave the report reverently.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Thank you. I'm always grateful for your work."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina looked at her with a flowery smile.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Tha, that is a wasteful word for a mere me, saintess-sama."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">That girl blushed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">What had written there was──.</span></div>

<div class="calibre15">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre6">Appearance of the suspects: A duo of a man and a woman wearing a hood. Details are unknown.</i></span></div>
<div class="calibre15">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre6">Attack method: Details are unknown.</i></span></div>
<div class="calibre15">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre6">Magic attribute: Details are unknown.</i></span></div>
<div class="calibre15">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre17"><i class="calibre6">Victims: Duke Riot and dozens of the guards.</i></span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">...was something like that.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Most are unknown."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Irina frowned.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Suddenly, several images emerged in her mind.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"This is──"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">[Oracle]</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">An ability to foresee events, such as the past and the future──only high-level priests had this ability to sense it.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">However, the emergence was accidental.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">So she couldn't control it herself.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The scene that emerged in the [Oracle].</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"It's terrible……"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">It was a shivering storm of murder.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Hooded and cloaked duo were going straight on the highway.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">They seemed like a young man and a girl.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She felt an awful atmosphere from the young man.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">An evil atmosphere.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">It was like a demon's, no more evil than that.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">And anything that came close to him will bleed out and disappear.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">At that time, the wind turned his hood for a moment and she looked at the young man's face.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"No way....."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She gasped</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">He resembled a man that she knew.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">However, his hair was silver and his eyes were different.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13"><span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Muddy pupils that full of grudge and hated everything in the world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She was once in love for the first time since her birth, with that Chrome, he had straight and refreshing eyes, totally different from this man.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"In the first place, he should have died..."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">Is it sentimental because he was my first lover?</em></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">No, no.</em></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">I am not moved by that.</em></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">However,──the bad feeling did not disappear.</span></div>


<p><strong>2 &#8211; Movement of [Darkness]</strong></p>


<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Shea and I continued our journey.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">──The murder case of Duke Riot, a nobleman of the Shady Kingdom, shook greatly the whole country.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Currently, the whole country was searching for the culprits.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">However, the culprits were unknown at present.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Neither I nor Shea wore the hood deeply and I hid my faces under a mask, so nobody could see our face.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">However, it was dangerous to stay in the Shady Kingdom forever.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">We entered the neighboring country, the kingdom of Ralpha, and now we were on the highway.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">As the name suggested, it was a kingdom where the healing goddess Ralpha had a thriving religion.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Ralpha temples were scattered throughout the country, and Irina was one of the highest priests after the Supreme Priest in the country.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The story that she would become the supreme priest soon, The commemorative ceremony and parade would soon take place there.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">My aim was, there.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I'll enter the parade course in the royal capital, and took revenge on Irina.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">However, I had a fairly weak leg, so this was a slow-paced journey.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">We sometimes use a horse-drawn carriage, but the road was a little uneasy.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">There was also a way to earn money as an adventurer temporarily──.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">But, because there was a Riot's case, I didn't want to be very open to the public&nbsp;</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A trip that used both a walk and a carriage was already five days.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Only three to four days remain until we reach the royal capital, huh.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The ceremony would be a week away, so there was still enough time.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Saintess Irina-sama is──I've seen her from a distance, but she was a very beautiful and kind person."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Shea spoke with an enchanted expression.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Her crimson hair that she made two-side up fluttered in the wind.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">This area seemed windy.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"......Well, the exterior is good, indeed."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I distortedly twisted my mouth.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"I'm sorry."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Shea looked surprised.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"I'm not blaming you. Rather than that, I want to ask one thing, is it ok?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I asked Shea.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Fulfil your revenge, how is the feeling?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">It was a question that came up in my mind unexpectedly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Why I asked such a thing, even I didn't know at all.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">To came to the country where Irina was, I wonder was my feeling overwrought.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Or, by knowing her answer, can I see the way to go?&nbsp;</span>I wonder.</div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"……I am"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Shea breathed slightly and shook her head from side to side.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"I haven't set my feelings right now."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She tighten her mouth tightly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Her flower-like lip paled, and she was trembling.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"There is a feeling that the grip of the chest has fallen. But will I be able to move forward to the future? Or is hatred, sadness, or suffering smoldering all the time? Right now is ... not yet."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Is that so"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I breathed a little.</span>
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">There were still five more opponents to avenge.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">When I had done it all, what kind of feeling do I have──.</span><br class="calibre4" />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14"><br class="calibre4" /></span></div>



<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">At night, we stayed in the forest a bit off the road.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">We could use the town's inn, but there was no enough saving, so it can't be helped.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Normally, staying in such a place must be on guard against bandits and monsters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">But I had no worries because I had EX Skill [Fixed Damage].</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">This skill was, at first deals "9999 damage" at the moment when the target enters within 10 meters of me.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">After that, it will continue to deal "9999 damage" every 3 seconds.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">In short, an enemy who was within 10 meters of me would die immediately at that point.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Of course, if they had more than 10,000 HP, that was probably only possible for the Demon King and the close class of it.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I reminded her that she should not be more than 10 meters away from me.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Spending night only two people with a man, well, be patient."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Because I followed without permission. Chrome-sama doesn't need to worry about me."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She said, and glanced at me.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"That..... maybe, do you want my body?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I was surprised by unexpected words.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"... What do you think to say it suddenly"</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Isn't that the intention of two people spending the night together?"</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"As I said before, it was just a saving."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Because all men were beasts, I learned it from my sister."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She said that when we first met, indeed.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Maybe you're still wary of me?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I inadvertently looked at Shea.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"I'm sorry."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She smiled with a mischievous expression.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Is my joke too much."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"No, If it's just a joke, it's alright."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I shrugged my shoulders.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Surely, this is the original Shea.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">When I first met her, she must had been pushing her limits to revenge on Riot.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Is she gradually returning to her ground state by fulfilling it?</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"It might be nice to be able to speak lightly."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Fufu, Thank you very much."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">She smiled again.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Well, she was still young, and I hope she could regain her calmness little by little.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I didn't seem to be able to regain those feelings anymore.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">No, maybe──will that day come to me someday?</em></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I didn't know anything yet.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Let's going to sleep immediately."</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Yes, Chrome-sama."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">We line up sleeping bags, and then lied down.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The tiredness of walking a whole day invited a comfortable sleep.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I fell asleep before I noticed, and then──.</span></div>



<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">[<i class="calibre6">"Can you ... Chrome, can you......... hear......me...?"]</i></span></div>



<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">This voice, was.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Nn……?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Wondering suspiciously, I woke up.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I wasn't in the forest.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I was, on a small hill.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Countless tombstones stood all around.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Until to the horizon, endlessly.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"What the hell, is this ...!?"</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I looked around in stunned.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">Uuuuuuuuuugghoaaaaaa~, It's huuuuuuuurrrttt~.......!</em></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">Will never forgive, never forgiveeeeeeeee......!</em></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Out of nowhere, pain and grudges were heard.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Not just one or two.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, or more.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A space full of negative thoughts.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14"><i class="calibre6">["Can you hear, Chrome......"]</i></span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">This time I could hear the voice clearly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">It was a familiar voice somewhere.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">When I think, something had shaken in front of me, then a figure emerged.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">The slender silhouette in jet-black, and I didn't know what that face looks like.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Is it a woman's figure?</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Long dark hair that reached the feet fluttered in the wind.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14"><i class="calibre6">["Yet, It seems like you're getting closer to here...... it will take a little more time......"]</i></span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">A mysterious woman (?) said.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I heard a sound.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I saw a long chain wrapped around the right hand.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14"><i class="calibre6">["But, it will be coming soon ... we'll meet soon...... Chrome......"]</i></span></div>
<div class="calibre13">

<div class="calibre13">

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">With a laugh, the jet-black silhouette disappeared.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">What the hell was that?</em></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">While suspicious, I noticed suddenly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">If I thought I had heard it before, it was the one I knew very well.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">For some reason, my head dazed and I noticed it late.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I knew that voice very well.</span></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">It was a voice I had heard over and over for last two years.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Yes, the woman's voice──was audible like when I using the EX Skill [Fixed Damage].</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">[Darkness]'s voice.</span></div>




<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">"Fuu..."</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">I slowly raised my upper body.</span></div>

<div class="calibre13">
<em class="calibre18">Was it just a dream?</em></div>
<div class="calibre13">
<span data-preserver-spaces="true" class="calibre14">Next of me, Shea was resting.</span></div>


<p><strong>3 &#8211; Subordinate 1</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"Holy fuuuuuuuuuccccccccc k!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<span class="calibre21">Barnez</span>&nbsp;screamed and knocked his fist against the wall.<br class="calibre4" />
The skin of the hand broke and blood gushed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
No pain was felt.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
All he felt was anger and regret.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That fuccin, Irina......!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<span class="calibre21">Barnez</span>&nbsp;bit his lips and moaned.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was a top holy knight serving the Ralpha Order.<br class="calibre4" />
By the previous incident, he would probably be dismissed.<br class="calibre4" />
Even though, he got on it with determination, but──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He couldn't expect Irina, would truncate him coldly.<br class="calibre4" />
Perhaps she was forced by the Supreme Priest and she offered her body against her will, He had a faint hope, but.......<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That hope was too brittle and then crushed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looking back at the Great Church that was just kicked him out.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looking at Irina and the Supreme Priest in the bedroom, it was clear that they had a relationship.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">How many times have you been embraced?</i><br class="calibre4" />
Just thinking it, He wanted to scrape his head.<br class="calibre4" />
The most beautiful and pure saintess in the world that he only can hold in his hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"And with that man...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Remembering the supreme priest's triumphant face, he felt he was really pathetic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──No, nothing more than that.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Irina was such a woman."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The black thoughts that gushed deep into his chest sprang up and swirled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Is that all lie what you say that you love me.....? When I am no longer useful, you just throw me away huh......? Damn, that fuccin bitch ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With the despair being betrayed, He seemed to vomit jealousy to the Supreme Priest.<br class="calibre4" />
Absolutely won't forgive them.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"In a week later, I'll make you knew it, Irina ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
On that day, a ceremony would take place at the Great Church and a parade would take place at the royal avenue.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Earlier, it was announced that the current Supreme Priest was retiring.<br class="calibre4" />
The new Supreme Priest would be Saintess Irina, a member of the Hero Party who had defeated the Demon King in the previous battle.<br class="calibre4" />
A ceremony and parade to celebrate her inauguration.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That filthy saint must be punished.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(Wait for it, Irina ...! You'll be given a punishment)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<span class="calibre21">Barnez</span>&nbsp;was burning a dark passion.</p>

<br class="calibre4" />
Shea wanted to know what kind of eyes I made when I still in the Hero party.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"And if, Chrome-sama's feelings get a little lighter by talking ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Looking straight at me, her blue eyes had a warm light that reassured me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">When did I last feel the warmth of a person?</i><br class="calibre4" />
I was betrayed by Yuno and Irina, expelled from the party and something in me was broken.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Inside of my heart, I felt something like a transparent wall was born.<br class="calibre4" />
A wall that rejected and repelled others.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea might have overcome it a little, perhaps because of the common denominator of "revenge".<br class="calibre4" />
Maybe because she couldn't hold that anymore, the feelings of closeness and solidarity.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"── It's not a pleasant story to listen to, you know."<br class="calibre4" />
"Just Chrome-sama, it's okay"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Gently smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please, please tell me"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──I told Shea, about the hero party had done.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The sacrifice of my magic to strengthen the hero.<br class="calibre4" />
Deprived of all magic and expelled from the party.<br class="calibre4" />
Being betrayed by a woman who I thought she was my lover and a man who I believed he was my best friend.<br class="calibre4" />
And then, the spirit of revenge raised the [Darkness] that dwelt in me, and expressed as the skill [Fixed Damage].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Hero-sama and co have done such a terrible thing to Chrome-sama......!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She learned the true color of them for the first time, and she seemed surprised.<br class="calibre4" />
The power of the world's heroes, the heroes Yuno, was created from the expense of sacrificing,&nbsp; by sacrificing me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No way..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea's face was pale.<br class="calibre4" />
Aside from Riot who she had actually seen his violence, [Hero Yuno] was still an absolute hero for her──and for the people around the world.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It would be a shock to know the shadow of the hero.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"However, there is no evidence"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I stared at Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
I felt upset, then straightened my eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If it's the power, then now it's my weakness. Originally my hair is black, but now is gray, and my limbs are completely weak and all thin──is that not enough evidence?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I snorted my nose lightly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Well, believe or not, it's all up to you."<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"If you want to leave me, you always free to leave. I won't blame you. In the first place, this is my revenge. There's no nothing to do with you."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Silence flew.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It didn't matter if Shea left.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Originally, this revenge journey was intended to went alone.<br class="calibre4" />
It was unexpected that she was there.<br class="calibre4" />
Therefore──,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I've been saved by you, that debt, I swear I'll return it."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea knelt.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Just like the knight swearing loyalty to their lord.<br class="calibre4" />
Kissed me at the back of my hand, and said.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I believe in you, Chrome-sama"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Believe in me, huh.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Trust──An emotion that had been vanished two years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The lover and best friend I trusted in all betrayed me.<br class="calibre4" />
Since then, I couldn't believe anyone.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of course, not everyone in this world was unworthy to be trusted.<br class="calibre4" />
There were bad people rotten in the world, but also there were good people.<br class="calibre4" />
Some people deserved trust.<br class="calibre4" />
If I looked for it, it would surely exist.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But that was just the logic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Believing in people was painful.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Believing in a person just awakened the pain of that day.<br class="calibre4" />
It reminded me of that day's despair.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
So now, I was surprisingly shaken.<br class="calibre4" />
For the first time in two years, I received the word "Believe" from others.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea's lips were touching the back of my hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
From there, a small spark scattered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"......!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I and Shea took a breath of surprise at the same time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["Since you got [Darknese], It's your first time to forgive others-desune~."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The voice of [darkness] resounded from within me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">I...... forgiving?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Am I, to Shea?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["Fufu, at least you're starting to recognize her as a friend, huh."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"She just following me herself."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I said it to [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama, this voice ...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea leaked a voice of puzzled.<br class="calibre4" />
Is seemed like she was able to hear the voice of [Darkness] that should normally only be heard by me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It's the voice of "power" dwelling in me. I simply call it [Darkness]."<br class="calibre4" />
"[Darkness]...yes?"<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["Chrome, [Fixed Damage] is a powerful skill, but your curse impairs your physical abilities. Shea with knowledge of the sword will make up for it. However──,"]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Darkness] told.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["What are you trying to face is, the world's strongest party members. She seems young and talented in swords, but she is clearly weak as she is now."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"... I've been told it a lot."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea opened her lips.<br class="calibre4" />
However, I would not refute it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was true, and probably she also thought it<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["That's why it's better to give strength to her."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"A power......you'll give it?"<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["Some of the powers of [Darkness] can be given. I'll give it to her."]</i><br class="calibre4" />

<a name="more" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre1"></a><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Giving power?"<br class="calibre4" />

I raised my eyebrows.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Does [Fixed Damage] skill will disappear or weaken?"<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["No, it doesn't affect your own skill. Well yeah...一I'll explain one by one."]</i><br class="calibre4" />

<i class="calibre6">["First, the darkness skill you have is [Destruction]. By exceeding a certain hatred and despair level has evolved it into EX skill [Fixed Damage]...... This will be the form you hold."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"In other words, I can use [Fixed Damage] as before?"<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["That's right. Also, as I've said before, you can't use any other [Darkness] skills due to the effect of the magic "Chain of Darkness". Choose any of the disabled skills and give it to her."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"……I see"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Even if I had it, it was the skills of [Darkness] that could not be used and had become a useless treasure.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">So, you want to Shea use it, huh.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["In short, in terms of strength, you are as before, only her will be strengthened."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"So, I told to share my skills, but can such a thing be doing?"<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["It is possible if the other party agreeing on it."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">The other party agreeing──yes.</i><br class="calibre4" />
I repeated those words in my heart.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What will do you do, Shea?"<br class="calibre4" />
"I want to help you. If it can make me be strong, please by all means."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea looked straight at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Any power is fine. Please bestow it to me, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
"... I understand. As you heard, [Darkness]. Give her some of my power."<br class="calibre4" />

<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre22">["Confirming the Master's will. Shea Framlite will be certified as the caster's [Subordinate]"]</span></i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre22">["Granting [Darkness] skills to [Subordinate]"]</span></i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre22">["Skills that can be granted are [Destruction], [Dissection], and [Acceleration]"]</span></i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre22">["Of these, [Destruction] is retained by Chrome Walker as before, and the remaining [Dissection] and [Acceleration] are given to Shea Framlite."]</span></i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre22">["In addition, the effect lasts until it is ended by the caster's will."]</span></i>

<br class="calibre4" />
At the next moment, my body was flooded with black light, and that gleam was transferred to Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“Nn……Kuu~…… ”<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her body convulsed with a strangely spark voice.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The gleam stopped right away.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">She doesn't seem has changed in particular──?.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This is……!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea drew her sword with a surprised face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was a black shine on the blade.<br class="calibre4" />
Its atmosphere was like a magic sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I can feel it, Chrome-sama. My sword is fulfilled with a strange power."<br class="calibre4" />
"For the sword, that strengthening ...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As mentioned earlier, the skills that dwelt in Shea were [Dissection] and [Acceleration].<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Among them, just [Dissection] that was expressed, huh?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I want to do a trial slash."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Unfortunately, there are only forest trees around.<br class="calibre4" />
If we cut it by accident, it could fall down to us and we would end beneath it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──No need for it, it's like a custom-made opponent has come huh."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I narrowed my eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh~"<br class="calibre4" />
"It's the approaching sign of a demon"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Even though I lost magic power by previous magic, but I still have the power to sense magic.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This dense and evil magic was not a human or an elf.<br class="calibre4" />
It was definitely a demon.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Although the Demon King was already defeated by the hands of the Hero Party of Yuno and co, their remnants were still rampant in various countries.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Is it a remnant faction or just a stray demon who had lost their way into the human world from the demonic world?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Human's ... smell ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"The smell of man and woman ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"Man... kills ... Woman... violate ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Emerging from the trees along with the noise were seven giants.<br class="calibre4" />
Each was about three meters tall and had a muscular human body with the head of a cow.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was an intermediate level demon "Minotaur".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And moreover, there were seven.<br class="calibre4" />
If I was a human knight, it was a level of strength that could not be confronted unless I was part of a corps unit.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was not known whether it was a stray demon or a remnant of the Demon King's army.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"......It's just a good chance to test your skills."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea put her hand on the sword handle.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her hands were trembling.<br class="calibre4" />
After all, it was scary.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't overdo it. It's still unknown how much the [Darkness] you've got, It's still unknown how strong you've become. In here I──."<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama, please stay within 10 meters of the enemy."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea looked back.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her dignified and dazzled eyes──had no color of fear, and there was a strong fighting spirit.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Keeping within 10 meters, that would be a sign for me to not defeat the enemy with [Fixed Damage].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If I can beat that, I can prove myself has become stronger.<br class="calibre4" />
On the upcoming journey, I will be eligible to keep up with Chrome-sama──or I think so."<br class="calibre4" />
"You don't have to suddenly fight a strong opponent."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I said with a cool face.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea smiles mischievously,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ara, are you worried?"<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm not ruthless enough to drive my travel companion to the dead, This me."<br class="calibre4" />
"Fufu, you admit me as a friend."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea's smile deepened.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No, that is ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was a word that suddenly came out of my mouth.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">A friend, huh?</i>
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">──Since you got [Darkness], It's your first time to forgive others?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">──Fufu, haven't you at least starting to recognize her as a friend?</i>
<br class="calibre4" />
I remembered the [Darkness]'s words.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you think it's a bit dangerous, come back immediately. In that case, I'll kill them with [Fixed Damage]."<br class="calibre4" />
"I will not bother Chrome-sama's hand."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea said that.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I leave──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While telling me, A girl knight kicked the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
Black energy wings grew around her ankle.<br class="calibre4" />
And at the same time,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Acceleration]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With Shea's voice, her body shook greatly.<br class="calibre4" />
She created afterimages at tremendous speed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha~...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The Minotaurs were amazed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It, it's too fast...... gyaa~!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Leaving aside the demons' mutter, Shea run through.<br class="calibre4" />
Her movement was so fast that it looked almost like a red flash.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"First of all, one"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Along with the voice, a red flash run again between the minotaurs.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A black glittering sword flash.<br class="calibre4" />
Red shining trajectory.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And that was, the all six.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In just a few seconds, all six remaining Minotaurs were beheaded and fell down.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Fuu~"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She released [Acceleration] and returned to me.<br class="calibre4" />
Wiped the blood from the blade and put it in the sheath.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"How about it, Chrome-sama? Am I, am I enough to help you?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She was bathed in the blood of the demons on her forehead and cheek, and she smiled with a gorgeous smile.<br class="calibre4" />
Just like a knight of [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"... Yeah, it's enough."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I returned a faint smile to her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A week later, we already in the capital city of Ralpha on the celebration day.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The day of the inauguration ceremony and parade when Irina became the new Supreme Priest.<br class="calibre4" />
And that was the day I would take revenge.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>5 &#8211; Day of The Parade</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
Irina was, for him she was his first love.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She was the ideal woman.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A gentle personality that can't be compared by anyone.<br class="calibre4" />
With her neat and beautiful appearance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
When he first met on an escort mission, his heart was captivated at a glance.<br class="calibre4" />
The pure saintess quickly turned from worship to love target for him, who was the top person of Holy Knight Order.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And the Saintess also responded to his wishes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was, immediately hooked on Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
The relationship between the young couple progressed quickly and soon became a relationship between a man and a woman.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In the public, Irina was said as the lover of Hero, but she told him that it was a misunderstanding.<br class="calibre4" />
The hero was just a friend, and only him that she loves.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He soared.<br class="calibre4" />
He wanted to give his body and heart for the sake of Irina, and he wanted to do anything.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And then, he acted as told by Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
In order for her to rose to the highest priesthood, he worked to trap those who might be in her way.<br class="calibre4" />
Not once or twice, but sometimes he even did dirty jobs such as assassinations.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She, the Saintess, deserved to be the Supreme Priest.<br class="calibre4" />
Then he had to eliminate the obstacles.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(Nevertheless, Irina discarded me.)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">The kisses that we shared repeatedly many times, is that just facade?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Did the words of love that we whispered to each other at the bed are a lie?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And because he was no longer useful, Irina abandoned him.<br class="calibre4" />
I remembered her figure when drooping to the Supreme Priest in front of his eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(After all, she just used me from the beginning)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As an easy-to-handle tool for her to go up in the priesthood.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Could not be forgiven.<br class="calibre4" />
That woman who trampled her heart.<br class="calibre4" />
Lightheartedly made use of others for the seat of the Supreme Priest, that woman was.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A gorgeous parade was taking place in the very front of his eyes.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Riding on the luxurious portable shrine was Irina, dressed in the Supreme Priest's robe.<br class="calibre4" />
The crowd gathered and cheered when they saw the young and beautiful Saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Indeed, only her exterior was good.<br class="calibre4" />
When he looked at that way, he was so frustrated that enough to tormented his chest.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(Holy fuccc, I'll show you the hell! You'll get the punishment, Irina!)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He pushed the crowd and walked toward the saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At the kingdom of Ralpha Royal capital.<br class="calibre4" />
After the inauguration ceremony of Irina, the parade was taking place.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I and Shea were watching the parade in the crowds.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Well then, when have I to take action, yes──.</i><br class="calibre4" />
When I was thinking, I turned my gaze to a point in the crowds.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"How strange, he is."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was a beautiful young man.<br class="calibre4" />
Something like a black haze clung to his refined body.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["I can see quite high hatred and despair of him."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I heard the voice of [Darkness] from my chest.<br class="calibre4" />
It was unusual for her to say such commentary.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["It's just like you used to...... No, Not like yours yet, those number is not as big as yours"]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Darkness] returned a voice as if she was smiling.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["He may have been betrayed and his heart was trampled, just like you."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
"Same as me......huh"<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea seemed to hear my mutter, and she looked back.<br class="calibre4" />
No, now she could hear [Darkness] when she became my [Subordinate].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That man running through the crowds. He looks so strange."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The black haze became darker.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Under the influence of [Darkness], I could see vaguely "negative emotions", such as malice and grudges of others.<br class="calibre4" />
I couldn't visualize it unless they had a strong "negative emotion".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It looked like a black fog now.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"IRINAAAAAAAAA!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That young man suddenly shouted.<br class="calibre4" />
At the same time kicked the ground and rushed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">He was fast──.</i><br class="calibre4" />
He was a lesser extent than my former party members Riot, Fara and Margo, but his's movement was on top-tier of warrior or knight.<br class="calibre4" />
He thrust toward Irina and the others at the speed like the wind.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What, what are, you!?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Protect the Saintess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The Ralpha Holy Knight Orders were guarding the portable shrine drew their swords all at once.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
“……!? Captain Barnez, why──”<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Said one of the holy knights.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't get in the way!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A man called Barnez flashed his sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Blood dripped.<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez slew three holy knights at once.<br class="calibre4" />
One and two more further with returning sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Strong……!</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Just the sole him was already overwhelming the Holy Knights.<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez, who killed five people in no time, accelerated further.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Even though I always love you! Even though I only thinking about you! Why you betray me, Irina!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez approached the Saintess' portable shrine, while shouting in irritation.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Tsk, He's going ahead──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was really impatient.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">The revenge target who had been pursuing for two years, will be stolen by other guy──.</i><br class="calibre4" />
But my physical ability couldn't stop him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In the first place, if I moved within the effective range of the skill, Irina would die immediately.<br class="calibre4" />
Then my purpose could not be fulfilled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
My hope was not for that woman's simple and easy death.<br class="calibre4" />
It because, the pain, remorse, and despair at the end, was the judgment of revenge──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, stop him!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I ordered my [Subordinate] girl knight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please leave it to me, Chrome-sama── [Acceleration]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded reverently and ran just like an arrow.</p>


<p><strong>6 &#8211; Conclusion of Fresh Blood</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"[Acceleration]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As soon as Shea muttered it, her movement turned into an afterimage.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Much faster than that man I mentioned earlier.<br class="calibre4" />
Her speed like a flash, comparable to Riot or the other of Hero's Party members──or perhaps surpassing them.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Still, can she make it in time?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez was already approaching a few meters before the portable shrine where Irina was.<br class="calibre4" />
The distance to Shea was about 20 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That's useless, that woman is mine──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I went forward reflexively.<br class="calibre4" />
However, my weakened feet were so sadly weak that I could only move slowly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Goddammmiiiittt......!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Revenge that had been burning for two years.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Is easily taken away by another man?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Maybe he had a grudge against Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
You maybe had anger, hatred, or despair accordingly.<br class="calibre4" />
But still, I was──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That person is mine......!"<br class="calibre4" />
"What is going on?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina descended from the portable shrine to the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As ever, she was much more beautiful than two years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
Divinely beautiful, pure as a goddess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Indeed, as a saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
...... However, it was only her appearance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Barnez, why do you do this?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina doesn't change her face even before the murderous man.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It, it's..... it's your fault!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez shouted a trembling voice.<br class="calibre4" />
He thrust his sword in front of her,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I've been thinking of you only and devoting everything! Even I've stained my hand with dirty work, as you say! But once you get the status of the Supreme Priest, you just easily throw me away? So, was I just a tool for you!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He gabbled in once<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The crowds turned to be noisy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"O, oi, what is he talking about......?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Saintess-sama has, done such a terrible thing ...?"<br class="calibre4" />
"There's no way, look at Irina-sama. There is no way such a divine and pure woman can do such a terrible thing."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The voices of those confused by Barnez's words were immediately sealed off by those who refute it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Anyway, the opposition in the cult is trying to plant a dirty image on Saintess-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
"That's right, Irina-sama is the true saintess, merciful to everyone!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Saintess-sama! Saintess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Saintess-sama! Saintess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A loud cheer quickly arose.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"......Well, turn out like this huh"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Only the exterior was really good, That Irina was.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The surrounding crowds were completely ally of "Saintess."<br class="calibre4" />
On the other hand, Barnez had been pointed out as a despicable person, who was trying to detract her reputation by the fact that completely untrue.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"... Shea, wait for a little."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I called out to her.<br class="calibre4" />
Nevertheless, without saying that──Shea had already read the air and stopped.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, she seemed to be on guard so that she could stop Barnez whenever he would hit Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I also, even if a little I have to get closer now.<br class="calibre4" />
I advanced with a weak step.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Meanwhile, the crowds had begun to condemn Barnez.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"A cowardly person who is trying to degrade Saintess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Who's the one paid you!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Go home, go home!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He began to be yelled at and pelted with rocks.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kuh ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As expected, Barnez had an impatient face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He would have wanted to expose Irina's "rottenness" in public.<br class="calibre4" />
In fact, given what she had done to me, what Barnez said was quite likely to be true.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But almost everyone in the crowds didn't know Irina's "back face".<br class="calibre4" />
They couldn't believe in Barnez' words.<br class="calibre4" />
Then,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please stop it, everyone"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was Irina who controlled the crowds that were heating up.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It looks like he's under the spell. The fact that it was a fuss about unfounded events and denounced me, that influence is──trapped him in the evil heart."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina opened her arms and proclaimed to the crowds.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ooh, what a poor one. In the name of Saintess Irina──I will heal you now."<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha, what the hell is that pure action!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Burns screamed in anger.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──No, he tried to cut her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His movement stopped suddenly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Guh..... I, I can't move ...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, that's already fine."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina extended her right hand towards him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Oh God, Please give salvation to his soul──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her pupils shone mysteriously while casting that spell.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I took a breath.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What Irina had just cast was the high-ranking priest magic.<br class="calibre4" />
And the effect was──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Uugh ... wha, what did you do to me...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez's expression changed completely.<br class="calibre4" />
He looked like a haunted object.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His face with such anger or hatred for Irina was completely falling through.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Have you calm down?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina smiled brightly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"U, uugh ... what have I done to Saintess-sama ...... aah...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnes was kneeling down on the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm very sorry, everyone! I have said nothing but shit! There's no way Irina-sama will do such a terrible thing!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez shouted at the crowds, reversing his attitude.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It looks like you've been trapped by a spell in a fight against a sorcerer ... Such a disgraceful behavior to a holy knight......aah"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She moaned in the voice of anguish.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Irina-sama! The sin of pointing my blade to you, I will redeem it with my own life!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While shouting it, Barnez was──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He put his sword to the neck and pulled it all at once.<br class="calibre4" />
That young knight fell down on the spot with the fresh blood gushing out.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"What a thing!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina made a sad voice.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But I did not miss it.<br class="calibre4" />
A slight smile came to Irina's lips.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The spell── that she had just cast.<br class="calibre4" />
It was a priest's forbidden spell that brainwashed and drove the subject to self-harm.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A super-high-class spell that could only be used by Irina, a high priest.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"At the very least, please rest peacefully."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina muttered with a sad expression and cast a healing spell.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The bleeding from Barnez's neck was slightly weakened.<br class="calibre4" />
But that didn't stop the bleeding.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was just a pose for the crowds.<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez was in the fatal wound and no longer could be healed with an advanced healing spell.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Aa... gh ... Iri... na..., M... my"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Barnez moaned with a faint voice.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">In the end, did he regain a little his sanity.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Or maybe──?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
His hand fell without force.<br class="calibre4" />
It was no longer moving.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">… He died huh.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A sense of relief that he did not kill my revenge target, and a pity for him.<br class="calibre4" />
Inside of me, that two emotions sprang up at the same time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">──At least sleep peacefully, Barnez.</i><br class="calibre4" />
I muttered in my heart.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Your remorse will soon be cleared"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
By my hand of course──.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>7 &#8211; Avenger and The Saintess </strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"Barnez, at the very least please sleep peacefully."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina knelt to the side of Barnez, praying to Ralpha, the healing goddess, while shedding large tears.<br class="calibre4" />
There was plenty of sorrow and a pious atmosphere.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"O, oi, he has, himself ...?"<br class="calibre4" />
"He couldn't stand the guilt to Saintess-sama ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"But Saintess-sama is, so merciful to such sinner...... Aah"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The crowds were still roaring, but their faces were enchanted by the charisma of Irina's charm as a Saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
...... Really truly, she was a good woman, just on the exterior.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, I was always deceived all the time, until the day I was expelled from the Hero's party.<br class="calibre4" />
Can't you say something great?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Walking slowly with my weak feet, I came to the side of Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"He killed himself. Did he repent of his sins......"<br class="calibre4" />
"It's wrong"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I shook my head left and right for Shea's murmuring.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That's Irina's priest magic."<br class="calibre4" />
"That is──."<br class="calibre4" />
"It's a kind of brainwashing spell. It's a forbidden spell that only be used by high priest──it can use to enslave and self-harming your opponent. Now Irina has done both his mouth-sealing and her Saintess's appeal at once."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With a cool face.<br class="calibre4" />
And in front of large crowds.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She easily killed Barnez.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Probably, what he was saying was genuine.<br class="calibre4" />
Given the information had gathered over the last two years, there was probably much more she had done to get that status.<br class="calibre4" />
Like plots, tricks, and even assassination──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The girl that I remembered, she was just a complete illusion.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea looked up at me.<br class="calibre4" />
Wait for my order.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I guess I can set up from now"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was still looking forward to.<br class="calibre4" />
However, some number of the escort of Holy Knight Order had been killed in the uproar. And now their number had decreased.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Of course, no matter how many escorts were in front of my skills ... it was very troublesome if Irina escaped while they being a shield.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If it was now──I might be able to hit the void.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Let's go, shea"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, I will protect you"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We went forward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The wind was strong.<br class="calibre4" />
We kept our hands on the hood so that the hood would not turn over, and the hem of the cape was fluttered in the wind.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We faced Irina at a distance of about 20 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Who the hell are you both?"<br class="calibre4" />
"You cannot get closer to Saintess-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
"As you can see, a suspicious man has just attacked. Anyone who makes suspicious movements will be restrained."<br class="calibre4" />
"Go away"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told quietly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You'll die if I get closer"<br class="calibre4" />
"Wh, what, ...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I went further.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Could they retreat after my warning, I wonder.<br class="calibre4" />
The distance to them was 16 meters.<br class="calibre4" />
A few meters further away from Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Eei, stop now!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
One of the escorts shouted as if he was frustrated.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama, from here I will"<br class="calibre4" />
"I leave it to you"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Along with my words, My [Subordinate] girl knight jumped out.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Went toward the leading escort knight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you confront me, there is no mercy!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The sword swung down and severed Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──No.<br class="calibre4" />
It was just her afterimage that the escort had severed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Go, gone."<br class="calibre4" />
"Too slow"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As if moving instantaneously──Shea moved to behind the enemy at a tremendous speed,<br class="calibre4" />
Dark skill [Acceleration].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And, the girl knight flashed her sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Dark skill [Dissection].<br class="calibre4" />
The enemy's sword even the armor were broken apart as if a piece of paper.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea ran further.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What I saw was a red flash.<br class="calibre4" />
Her flame-like red hair in two-side-up was fluttered, and the movement drawn a vivid red trajectory.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She ran through the ten escort knights for an instant and came back to my side.<br class="calibre4" />
At the same time, their swords and armors broken into pieces, then fell to the ground with a rattling sound.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Like the first escort knights, the other ten had torn swords and armors.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I, I can't see the movement──."<br class="calibre4" />
"What the heck is that person......!?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Our swords and armors are...... It's impossible......"<br class="calibre4" />
"If you treasured your life, don't get in his way."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To those who stood up in stunned, Shea told coldly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The next is not your weapons or armor, but your bodies will split into two."<br class="calibre4" />
"Kuh......"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The escort knights backed as if they were pressured.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Indeed, in unarmed, it was not possible to compete with Shea which had speed and cutting power exceeding human knowledge.<br class="calibre4" />
Well, it was the same case whether they in fully armed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I, I won't regret my life!"<br class="calibre4" />
"We are the knight to protect Saintess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
"For the sake of her, even if we die──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The escort knights were ready at once.<br class="calibre4" />
Did they want to fight bare-handed fist?<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"──Chrome-sama"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea looked at me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Now, what should I have to do──.<br class="calibre4" />
That was what I thought.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At Riot's case, the soldiers were doing something wrong, so they were all annihilated.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But these escort knights were only protecting Irina with a sense of mission.<br class="calibre4" />
If they got a few meters closer, they all would automatically be killed──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please wait a while"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina called out.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Their aim is me, and I will do that."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Stared at me straight.<br class="calibre4" />
It was the gaze of a dignified Saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Take off your hood"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I ignored and went further.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina raised her eyebrows and approached us.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
20 meters...... 19 meters...... 18 meters remained......<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I measured the distance carefully.<br class="calibre4" />
If I got too close, she would get 9999 damage.<br class="calibre4" />
I didn't want her to die immediately......<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Saintess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
"It is dangerous!"<br class="calibre4" />
"Ain't I a member of the Hero Party? So, don't worry so much."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina smiled at the escorts.<br class="calibre4" />
A smile full of holiness and generosity.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That saintess smile, just a sham.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"And I'm blessed by God. I won't get hurt unless it's a Demon King or the class close to it."<br class="calibre4" />
"Take off the hood before her, you two"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked at Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You also stop there, Irina. Don't get closer to us anymore."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Stopping her from being killed immediately.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"And then, call the escorts back to your side, I cannot calm down if like this."<br class="calibre4" />
"......Okay."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina called her escorts back to her as I said.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Everyone was staring at me with killing intent.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At the distance of 16 meters, I confronted with Irina.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>8 &#8211; Avenger and The Saintess 2</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
"Now, take off your hood food."<br class="calibre4" />
"……Okay"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I raised my hood.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Silver hair and a mask that hid face.<br class="calibre4" />
The vestiges of me from two years ago, it should be small.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea also raised her hood next to me.<br class="calibre4" />
She also hid her face with a mask, like me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You are……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina slightly tilted her head.<br class="calibre4" />
She probably was looking for a memory of who I am.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Changes in hair color and thin skinny limbs──the former image of me had changed completely.<br class="calibre4" />

The atmosphere I wear, that was it<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, she might be noticed who am I by my voice.<br class="calibre4" />
So, I lower my voice instead of camouflaging.<br class="calibre4" />

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KK1C7hM/10-z-Ta-Fn-Ix.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<br class="calibre4" />
"... What do you want from me?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina's attitude was like facing her first-time opponent.<br class="calibre4" />
After all, she didn't seem to recognize me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Or──have you forgotten me already?</i><br class="calibre4" />
For your own ambitions, you switched men and slept as much as you want<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And──Irina's expression changed slightly.<br class="calibre4" />
Her eyes narrowed slightly, leaving her smile with a neat and calm atmosphere.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It seemed she would do something.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I feel her hostility towards me was growing.<br class="calibre4" />
After all, she was a partner who once spent as a lover.<br class="calibre4" />
Rough predictions were made about what she was trying to do.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, no matter what she did, it was useless.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The next moment, something like a black flame rose from around me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Mm ...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina slightly raised her eyebrows.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama, just now is...?"<br class="calibre4" />
"It's Irina's high-level magic. She shot it without chanting."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I answered to what Shea asked in a whisper.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"That is──."<br class="calibre4" />
"She tried to curse us just like to Barnez, who committed suicide earlier using Brainwashing magic. Maybe she is making appropriate excuses around."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I snorted and stared at the Saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Pretended to hear the requirement then attacked with magic. It's a pretty good personality, Irina."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But it didn't work for me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
EX Skill [Fixed Damage] worked to "All" that had hostility toward me.<br class="calibre4" />
Even Inflicted 9999 damage on magical types and annihilated it──.<br class="calibre4" />
Yes, as if Irina's spell that she shot earlier had destroyed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
".....what actually is it?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The Saintess floated a confused expression.<br class="calibre4" />
Naturally, that expression was just acting.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Until when would she play as an innocent, yes.<br class="calibre4" />
She had a really good personality, after all.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Second, I'll tell it to you."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I said while looking at her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"First, your attack won't reach on me, and one thing again──if you get within 10 meters of me, you'll die instantly."<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha, what is...?"<br class="calibre4" />
"That's just an advice. I don't want you to die easily."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I said, took one step closer to Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Just only one step.<br class="calibre4" />
I wouldn't get any closer.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, destroy all the escort's weapons"<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh"<br class="calibre4" />
"Just for intimidating. There's no need to kill anyone but Irina. After that, you have to advance to the prior meeting point"<br class="calibre4" />
"──Acknowledged"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea bowed reverently.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Then she drew her sword and got ready.<br class="calibre4" />
The blade was wrapped in a black aura.<br class="calibre4" />
The skill of [Dissection] dwelled on the sword.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You all!"<br class="calibre4" />
"What do you want to do to the Saintsess-sama!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Immediately the escort knights stood in front of Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If they get closer, My skill will kill them. Finish them before it happened as much as possible, can you do it?"<br class="calibre4" />
"As your order, Chrome-sama" settle them<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She was completely my first knight on board, Shea was.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You all are, get in the way"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Said that and my [Subordinate] girl knight kicked the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shee closed the distance with the escorts at almost subsonic speed.<br class="calibre4" />
Black energy wings grew on both her feet.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
By the power of [Darkness], she had the ability to [Dissection] with sword and moving with [Acceleration].<br class="calibre4" />
Shea, who could be called as a super knight, sneaked through the escorts in a flash.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The swords of the Holy Knights were slashed together from the base.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Wha...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
They stood up stunned.<br class="calibre4" />
The sword blade flew here while rotating,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Bash~...!</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As soon as it entered the range of [Fixed Damage], it disappeared as dust.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"As you can see, If you get within 10 meters of me, it will be destroyed. You all are equally hostile to me."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked around the escorts.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Ugh……"<br class="calibre4" />
"What, what the hell are these guys ...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
"A monster ...?!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
They stepped back as if they were pressured.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Don't get close if you still treasuring your life."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Said it, I looked to Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Do as we planned. I'll catch you up later."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She nodded and approached Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Kyaaa~..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That Saintess screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea wrapped behind her very fast and restrained her.<br class="calibre4" />
Further press the blade against her neck,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you do something strange, what will happen is... you know it, right?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Ugh……"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina stiffened and nodded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea would sever her neck before she could attempt to use a non-chanting spell.<br class="calibre4" />
With Irina's resistance sealed, Shea got out of the surrounding.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You all too. If you approach, you will die. It is better to escape quickly."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I declared it to the crowds.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If they saw the sword disappeared by [Fixed Damage] earlier, it was clear that "If you approach, you will die" was not just a threat.<br class="calibre4" />
Immediately, the crowds fled like a spider's children scattered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea took Irina and ran on a prepared horse.<br class="calibre4" />
And I started off on a horse a little late, while controlling the escort knights with my skills.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
We run for tens of minutes and arrived at the point we planned in advance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was an old abandoned church.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was so ironic that Ralpha's church was the place to judged Ralpha's Saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No one will get in the way here"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I entered the church.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea and Irina were in front of the altar at the innermost of the church.<br class="calibre4" />
I faced her about 15 meters away.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Wh, what actually are you going to do to me ...!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her voice was shaking.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You are, Who are you, what is your purpose?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Am I? who I am, Don't you know me well?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I slowly removed my mask.<br class="calibre4" />
For the first time in two years, she faced her former lover with his real face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The eyes of Irina and I were intertwined.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A few moments of silence.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was a feeling that the air was gradually becoming heavier, colder and more concentrated.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No way"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina took a breath.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"There's no way, you are──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her voice trembled and faded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome ...!? No way, but you were that time ..."<br class="calibre4" />
"I was alive. Thanks to you all, I have gained 'power.' I have to grudge and burn hatred."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Holding despair and revenge.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Now, it's time for the judgment──Saintess-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome, please...... do not do a terrible thing"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina said in a trembling voice.<br class="calibre4" />
Shea pressed her sword against her neck, blocking her movement.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please, listen to....."<br class="calibre4" />
"Okay, so let's listen to your story."<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome……?"<br class="calibre4" />
"First of all, tell me the truth, why I was chosen to be sacrificed. You promised to marry me that day."<br class="calibre4" />
"Tha, that is ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina's face turned pale.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You understand the effect of my skills, right? I also have killed Riot."<br class="calibre4" />
"...!"<br class="calibre4" />
"You are a high-ranking priest. Can you sense the [Darkness] I have?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked at her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Irina, I allow you to use the sensing spell, but if it any other spell I will kill you immediately."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
My eyes shot sharply the saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"... I, I understand."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina cast a priest perception spell.<br class="calibre4" />
It was to measure hatred, despair, and [Darkness] in me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This is ...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Immediately, Irina's face drew blood.<br class="calibre4" />

<p><strong>9 &#8211; Avenger and The Saintess 3</strong></p>

<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, get Irina's feet forward."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Before listening to the story, I ordered my [Subordinate] girl knight.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded and got Irina to sit, her appearance as if both her feet had thrown forward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
First of all, prepared for the first sanctions.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Speak"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I urged Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"... Forbidden Curse "Chain of Darkness". Its power is to suck up the subject's hatred and despair, to create [Darkness], and to give the designated humans the [Light] generated by the created [Darkness]."<br class="calibre4" />
"In other words, As the [Darkness] was born in me, and Yuno gained [Light] thanks to it ... is that right?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes. That was what Valery-san explained."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"To give you despair, Umm, I have to court you... By doing so, your [Darkness] would be deeper......"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Surprisingly straight, Irina told me, Does she avoid making an excuse for buying extra anger of me?.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The reason you were chosen was that Valery-san and Yuno especially requested. I haven't been told for the reason."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In other words, ask Valery and Yuno for the true reason.<br class="calibre4" />
Of course, Irina really knew the reason and might just be hiding it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Well, it's okay.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Next question."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I asked about the question I wanted to know more.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Are you going to betray me from the beginning?"<br class="calibre4" />
"...!... no, it's not right! I really loved you."<br class="calibre4" />
"Wasn't you embraced by Yuno on the night I propose you,"<br class="calibre4" />
"Really, I really fell in love with you."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina sighed sadly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"But, I have ambition. I don't want to end as just priest──I want the higher. I want to be a saintess who can be passed down to future generations."<br class="calibre4" />
"……Hnn"<br class="calibre4" />
"At first, it was just a small wish, but it turned to be an ambition, and it grew so bigger day by day that I couldn't control it."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina continued.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"While competing with the other hero's parties, my ambition grew infinitely. I thought that only Yuno, who gained [Light], could fulfill it."<br class="calibre4" />
"So──that was why you turned away to him?"<br class="calibre4" />
"But, umm...... at that time, somehow it happened!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina shouted.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"You abandoned me and get to Yuno, was it you have been tricked?"<br class="calibre4" />
"That's right! The only one who really I love is you! Despite my ambition, it was a mistake to allow my skin to another man. Even now, I still regret it. I still have a feeling to you from the bottom of my heart...... "<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Without saying anything, I stepped on slightly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
An animal-like bitter voice leaked from Irina's mouth.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her feet touched the area of [Fixed Damage] and fresh blood spewed out.<br class="calibre4" />
I carefully adjusted the distance so as not to kill her, and only hurting her feet.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──I've been training my skills in the last two years.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The skill's damage value and range of effect did not change, but I learned the technique of limiting the area to be damaged by fine adjustment of the distance.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Everything was for this time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Perhaps, her feet would have suffered irreparable damage again if she took once again.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Next is the arm. Shea."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She made Irina's arm to stuck out according to my orders.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"St, stop..... I beg you, please stop it..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina screamed, but I and Shea ignored it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"How about the man earlier? Is he also tricked you?"<br class="calibre4" />
"That, that is, that... I was brutally violated! He put medicine on me and messed up my body──Agggh, aaaaaaaaaaagggyaaaaaaaaaaa!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
This time, her arms.<br class="calibre4" />
The limbs of Irina were now dead.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Aa ... ghh ... Chrome~........."<br class="calibre4" />
"Transparent lie is unsightly, Irina" blatant<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down coldly at the saintess.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"In the end, all you have done is just counting. Anyone who can be used for what you want──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Why did I fall in love with her, I wonder.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
No, when she became my lover, she wasn't such a woman.<br class="calibre4" />
I wanted to think so.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At first, it was not a lie that I fell in love with her.<br class="calibre4" />
There was a desire to believe her words in every corner.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Even though regretted it, it was still an important thought for me──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">But, is that even also a lie?</i><br class="calibre4" />
I no longer knew where the truth was and where the lie was.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Surely, I wouldn't know it forever.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">──I also don't think I want to understand.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I felt that my regret that has been smoldering for a long time was clearing little by little.<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down at Irina, who was bloody and suffering, with surprised in that awakening feeling.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No, don't kill me! Please don't kill meeeeeee!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
As might be expected, She couldn't afford to keep up that saintess appearance.<br class="calibre4" />
Exposing her nature, she screamed for her life.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her face distorted with tears was so ugly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Let's go back to be a lover again, like we did in the past? You can embrace this body as long and much as you want! And even money ... I'll be the Supreme Priest so I can give you as much as you want! Right? You also, still have feeling about me, haven't you? I, I'm much better than a woman there? Both face and body──"<br class="calibre4" />
"Be relieve, Irina. I won't kill you."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Neither anger nor hatred will ever go away.<br class="calibre4" />
Even now, there was a fiery flame in the heart of my chest.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
However, there was still room to calmly perceive such a state.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"After all, We once a lover, Irina"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told while thinking in innocent.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome ... Thank you very much"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina's expression was shattered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Even so, I not sure she believed my words straightly.<br class="calibre4" />
However, she was now in a situation where her limbs had been crushed, her resistance has been sealed, and she had no choice but to take my word.<br class="calibre4" />
You were trying to behave in a way that didn't ruin my mood, right.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">But──Too bad for you, Irina.</i><br class="calibre4" />
Whatever attitude you took, I had decided.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Revenge on you──that was the climax stage.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
From now on, <i class="calibre6">execute</i>

<p><strong>10 &#8211; The Feeling of that Day Fade Away</strong></p>

<br class="calibre4" />
"Be relieve, Irina. I won't kill you, but──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked down at Irina, whose limbs were crushed and groaning.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"There are two conditions. The first is──Confess what you all hero's party have done."<br class="calibre4" />
"Confessions...?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina frowned.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Explain the event two years ago in detail and save it with audio magic. I will spread it around the world."<br class="calibre4" />
"Tha, that is──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina turned pale.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Isn't there high-level priest magic like that? With the power you have, it can be saved as non-duplicatable audio magic. It's the proof that you've spoken yourself."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked at Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If you don't, I'll kill you. okay?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Ye, yes ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She had no choice.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
If she confessed her sins to all over the world──some might believe, some might not, but Irina's reputation would fall.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
──As I ordered, Irina recorded the confession of their sins with audio magic and sealed it in a small orb.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This, this is it......"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
An orb was placed on the side of Irina who crawled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Shea, take it."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea picked up that orb and left it in her pocket.<br class="calibre4" />
I supposed that this have to be distributed all over the world at the right time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Then, the second condition is."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And here was the actual game.<br class="calibre4" />
To completed my revenge.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Be my subordinate"<br class="calibre4" />
"Eh……?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina had a confused face.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I can make the subject as [Subordinate]. Plainly speaking, You are under my control and a part of my power."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The conditions and the skills that could be given had been checked in advance.<br class="calibre4" />
In order to finish my revenge on Irina.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I am, moreover...?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Serving once a betrayed lover as a subordinate──isn't that humiliating, Irina? This is my revenge."<br class="calibre4" />
"I, I understand. I'll serve Chrome."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina bit her lips and nodded.<br class="calibre4" />
She was making a look that looked so sad, but I know.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">[What, is this your revenge?]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
She sneered inside.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">[That was cheap if my life is saved]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">[I'll lower my head as much as needed]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">[If you are going to violate me, please do as much as you want]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I could hear such a voice.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But I was also sneering inside.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Did you think my revenge was enough with just this, Irina?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Make this woman my [Subordinate]. So she will be excluded from [Fixed Damage]?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Checked it out with [Darkness].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">["That's right. After you making Irina as [Subordinate], [Fixed Damage] will not hurt her. Also, [Subordinate] cannot hurt you."]</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Darkness] answered.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"So, as just I said, make Irina as my [Subordinate]"<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre25">["Confirming the master's will. Authorizes Irina Valim as the master's [Subordinate]."]</span></i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At the same time, Irina's forehead glowed pale.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A black-purple pattern emerged slightly.<br class="calibre4" />
It was a pattern that looked like a heart-shaped.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Now you are my [Subordinate]. From then on, pledge your loyalty."<br class="calibre4" />
"Yes, Chrome──no, I should call you Chrome-sama from now. Please excuse my rudeness."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina spoke reverently.<br class="calibre4" />
While crawling, she lowered her head and rubbed his forehead against the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Please order me what you want. I will do whatever I can with your orders."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
What a good woman.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Well then, Let's empower my subordinate."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told quietly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It would be inconvenient if your limbs stay crushed. I'll make it move freely."<br class="calibre4" />
"……! Tha, thank you very much"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina raised her face.<br class="calibre4" />
Her expression was shining.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I was satisfied.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Once the hope had been raised, then fell it down into despair right in the next moment.<br class="calibre4" />
That pleasure was.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Now, come receive this── My [Subordinate] Irina"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I selected a skill that can be given from [Darkness] and gave it to her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The name of the skill was──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Demonic Beastification], that was it.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Hyaaaaaaaaaaa... gyaaaaaaaaaaaa...!?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina screamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The crushed hand grew creepy, and the feet became insect-like arthropods.<br class="calibre4" />
Her white, smooth skin was covered by an armor-like exoskeleton.<br class="calibre4" />
Her beautiful face became full of wrinkles, turning into a demon-like appearance with an expression of indignation and sadness.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"No... what, this ... noooooooooooooo ..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina kept screaming of despair.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There should be no pain.<br class="calibre4" />
However, she must feel the fear and disgust that her own body was replaced by something other than herself and that was an ugly demonic beast.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The beautiful and neat Saintess disappeared from this world.<br class="calibre4" />
All that remained was a horrible bloodthirsty monster.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Due to the skill effect, she remained in this form of a demonic beast until she died.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"This is your end, Irina"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I stared at the demonic beast [Subordinate].<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"At least like a 'Saintess', dedicate yourself to mankind until you die──I order you to hunt the remnants of the Demon King's army."<br class="calibre4" />
"Giiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaa~ agghhhhuuooooooooooooo~"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That demonic beast, formerly was Irina, barked.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her consciousness as a human still remained.<br class="calibre4" />
But she couldn't speak mankind's words and I couldn't go against my orders.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina's human life was over.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
From now on, she would continue to fight against the remnants of the Demon King Army.<br class="calibre4" />
Until her life run out, according to the instructions I had given.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Her attack power was low, but the regeneration was set to an unusually high type of monster, so she won't die easily.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Despite being hurt by the remnants of the Demon King's army and continuing to suffer, she did not die.<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">You have to keep fighting, Irina.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
With the appearance of a terrifying monster, while maintaining the reason as human──She lamenting in despair.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>11 &#8211; The Journey Continues</strong></p>


<br class="calibre4" />
I kept the audio magic orb that recorded what she had done.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Let's spread this to each country at the right time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At that time, the popularity of "Saintess"-sama will fall to the ground.<br class="calibre4" />
Some who believe in her might consider this a plot.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But "The facts that this has been told in her own voice" was heavy.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"The first one is a settlement, huh?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina, who had turned into a demonic beast, headed to the frontiers of the Luphus Empire, where many remnants of the Demon King Army were gathering.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The residence of the Hero Yuno was also in that country.<br class="calibre4" />
Because it was far from Ralpha, it will be a long journey──.<br class="calibre4" />
Eventually, we'll have to give Yuno the appropriate reward.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Chrome-sama"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea walked to me.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"……What's wrong?"<br class="calibre4" />
"No, that is."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea was approaching me in a shy manner.<br class="calibre4" />
Gently touched my hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea gently stroked my thin, deadwood arm.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Are you concerning me?"<br class="calibre4" />
"That person, Isn't she a former lover of you?"<br class="calibre4" />
"That is already all over."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I shook my head left and right.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At that time, I thought Irina would always be with me.<br class="calibre4" />
Sharing the fun and sad things together and walked our lives together, and──.<br class="calibre4" />
I dreamed of such a life.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
After the battle against the Demon King's army, I was going to see an ordinary mediocre happiness──that was what I dreamed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I don't have any feelings for her anymore."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">──I don't know if it is easily divided completely.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
At least I would never forget, I couldn't.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Will I still be hurt when I think back about her?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Do I continue to burn my heart with hatred and grudges?</i><br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">Or──.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I have been saved thanks to you"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea looked straight at me.<br class="calibre4" />
Her blue eyes were moist.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"For my own life, and the dignity of my sister's soul. We have been saved. That's why──."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
A soft and warm hand gently held my hand.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I also──want to save you if I can do. It may be funny and presumptuous, but if your mind becomes a little lighter, I want to be with you."<br class="calibre4" />
"... just the feeling only, I'll accept it."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I slightly distorted my lips.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Thanks for the care of Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
At least I tried to smile, but my expression couldn't be expressed well.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Four more people──my journey continues. What will you do?"<br class="calibre4" />
"Ara, didn't I say it before?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea smiled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I'm your [Subordinate]. I'll accompany where you go and I'll be your power."<br class="calibre4" />
"If so──shall we go?"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Departure.<br class="calibre4" />
I couldn't keep immersed in sentiment.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There was still remained, people of my revenge target.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Where are you going next, Chrome-sama?"<br class="calibre4" />
"My ultimate goal is the Hero Yuno"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I told Shea.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Unlike other members, he has the power of [Light]. Even though I have [Darkness], it won't be easy."<br class="calibre4" />
"[Darkness] and [Light] ──"<br class="calibre4" />
"In the last two years, my power has increased a lot, but Yuno may be stronger. That's why I want to gather information first."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And, I.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"While taking revenge, investigate Yuno's power, and eventually give proper punishment to all members."<br class="calibre4" />
"I'll follow Chrome-sama."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Shea nodded reverently.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"I will continue this journey. The next target is──"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I stared at the void.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
I looked at the face of “a person”.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Sage Valery"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That was the name of my third revenge target.<br class="calibre4" />

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<br class="calibre4" />
On the road to the Luphus Empire Frontier──.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
There were dozens of demons in front of her.<br class="calibre4" />
Those were the remnants of the Demon King Army.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">── Kill.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Such an impulse sprung up from within her.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gurururuooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaa!"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Raised a roar.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
That Demonic Beast advanced according to the lord's order.<br class="calibre4" />
To fight against the demons.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(No, such a thing...... I'm Saintess Irina ...! Why, why I have to turn to be this ugly demonic beast..... I won't, I don't like this ...)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Irina, who her body became a demonic beast, could no longer even utter human voices.<br class="calibre4" />
She could only cry despair in her heart.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(My beautiful face, and body ... return them... I beg you, Chrome.....!)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Hit the demons in front of her with the insect-like articulating feet.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The enemy's head was crushed.<br class="calibre4" />
However, Irina's articulating feet were not so strong and could easily be torn off.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Gaaaaaaaaarrrururururuooaaaaaaaaaaaa..."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The demonic beast Irina moaned for intense pain.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(It hurts... it huuuuuuurts......! Enough, I don't want...... I want to escape ... I want to escapeeeeeeee!)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But, she couldn't escape Chrome's order to fight the remnants of the Demon King Army.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
The torn articulated feet regenerated immediately and struck the next demons.<br class="calibre4" />
She always defeated them, but her articulating feet broke again.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Severe pain.<br class="calibre4" />
Regeneration.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Severe pain, regeneration.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration severe pain regeneration......<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
And again, severe pain and regeneration──such an act continued endlessly.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(I'm ... I'm a saintess you knooooowwwww... I'm worshiped from all over the world, and men from all over the world kneel before me...... that brilliant future will have been waiting for me, however, why is such a thing... aaaaaaaaaaaah...!)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
While crying in her heart, the demonic beast Irina kept fighting.<br class="calibre4" />


<p><strong>12 &#8211; Hero Knight Margo</strong></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<br class="calibre4" />
Two shadows were wriggling in the dark castle.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
One is a knight.<br class="calibre4" />
One is a dragon.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"It looks like the Minotaur squad in the kingdom of Ralpha has been wiped out. Seven intermediate demons against only one person."<br class="calibre4" />
"Hou, that person is quite a fierce man."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
In front of the words of the blue giant dragon──Demon Lagios, the knight grew small.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Margo Lascada.<br class="calibre4" />
One member of the hero's party who defeated the Demon King Vilgarodomus, the top knight of the Luphus Empire.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Forty-five years old, he was also known as a hero knight because of his unbroken sword skills and personality, commandment, and achievements of defeating the Demon King.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"If that is seven Minotaurs, it will be an opponent that can be managed by human knights in a unit. If it was defeated by one person alone──."<br class="calibre4" />
"I guess that person has the power of hero class."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Lagios nodded to Margo's words.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Or maybe a warrior comparable to you"<br class="calibre4" />
"To this me, huh"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Margo growled small<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"In addition, he seems to have a sign of [Darkness]. It's a troublesome<br class="calibre4" />
&nbsp;opponent."<br class="calibre4" />
"[Darkness]...huh"<br class="calibre4" />
"Yuno's [Light], the hero who defeated the Demon King──that is a power comparable to that. "<br class="calibre4" />
"Comparable to the power of Yuno..... It can't be, it is"<br class="calibre4" />
"Oh, you all created it, right? As a price to create the hero's [Light]"<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Asked the question to Margo, the giant dragon exhaled.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He remember that day two years ago.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"To strengthen Yuno with the power of [Light]."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery, the sage, cut out during a discussion at the hero party, excluding chrome.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"Because if like this we just keep pace with other hero's parties."<br class="calibre4" />
"Strengthen with the power of [Light].....?"<br class="calibre4" />
"In a recent battle at an ancient ruin, I found a magic book. It was written there, a forbidden magic."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Valery answered Margo's questions.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
"[Chain of Darkness]──You have to sacrifice one to succeed the spell."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Margo was afraid of the words.<br class="calibre4" />
He thought he would be sacrificed.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Fortunately, it was not Margo, but Chrome.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was deprived of his lover and created [Darkness] in despair, abandoned by his best friend.<br class="calibre4" />
The [Darkness] also produced the [Light] at the same time.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
[Light]'s power was amazing.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He defeated the Demon King's Army leader, Frangilas, with a single blow, and Yuno continued to show a remarkable success.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Finally, he defeated the Devil King Vilgarodomus.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Yuno, who defeated the Demon King, quickly gained the highest honor as a hero who saved the world.<br class="calibre4" />
Bards from all over the world sang his heroic tan, and everyone praised him.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Margo has been thinking over the past two years.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">──If I was the one had the power of [Light], not Yuno.</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He was the top knight of the Luphus Empire.<br class="calibre4" />
As a member of the hero's party that defeated the Demon King, his reputation was unshakeable.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
But the hero's reputation far surpassed.<br class="calibre4" />
Since Yuno's residence was in the Luphus Empire, his fame also faded.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
To put it simply, it was a bonus for the hero.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Margo was overwhelmingly referred to as "one of the Hero Yuno's companions" rather than "Hero Knight".<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
It was humiliation.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Jealousy of him was only growing day by day.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(I'm a hero too. No, I'm more than that youngster──.)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Margo clenched his lips.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Moreover, Saintess Irina, whom he secretly thought of, was now the hero's fiance.<br class="calibre4" />
He felt intense jealousy when he thought that Yuno was holding that pristine beauty as he wants.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Swordsmanship, fame, women──and youth.<br class="calibre4" />
In all, he lagged behind Yuno.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He had to admit.<br class="calibre4" />
But that was why Margo sought more “Power”.<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
He secretly reached out to the remnants of the Demon King's Army, and became friendly with Lagios, the 13th surviving Demon King's executive.<br class="calibre4" />
Then he began to work on the "plan."<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
<i class="calibre6">(This time, I will become the only absolute hero)</i><br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
Not Yuno, the hero of [Light], but this Margo Lascada,<br class="calibre4" />
<br class="calibre4" />
