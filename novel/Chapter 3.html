<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; My Sister and My Childhood Friend</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yesterday was terrible…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was left alone </span><span class="calibre9">so I </span><span class="calibre9">waited for Nanami to come back</span><span class="calibre9">, </span><span class="calibre9">then went home together.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was worried about Akari, </span><span class="calibre9">but it seemed that</span><span class="calibre9"> she arrived at home before me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari…are you okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that incident, Akari locked herself inside her room. She didn’t show up at dinner, and even took a bath before I </span><span class="calibre9">arrived</span><span class="calibre9"> home.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That’s why I couldn’t read her notes last night.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I wanted to know her feelings, after everything that happened…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, crap&mdash; I’ll be late.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I glanced at the clock‘s hands, it was already time for school.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">A lot of things happened, so I guess I’ll need some time to collect my thoughts.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With that in mind, I headed for the door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Aah!… A-Akari, good morning.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I met her as I was about to leave the house.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was surprised when I called her out of nowhere. But as usual, she ignored me (again). She might be upset. I guess </span><span class="calibre9">I have</span><span class="calibre9"> to start from scratch again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“A…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But it’s strange.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Normally, whenever I </span><span class="calibre9">would</span><span class="calibre9"> call out to her, she would immediately walk away without saying a word. But now, for some reason, she </span><span class="calibre9">stopped</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Aware of my </span><span class="calibre9">presence, she then whispered something</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari… What’s wrong?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was curious so I tapped her on her shoulder and asked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I looked at her face, and as usual, her ears were bright red. Maybe she’s still worried </span><span class="calibre9">about what happened</span><span class="calibre9"> yesterday?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“~~~~!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She screamed </span><span class="calibre9">inaudibly</span><span class="calibre9"> and with a bang, she opened the door and ran away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What am I supposed to do…?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The only thing I could do was mutter to myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">***</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, let’s end here today!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was getting late and the manager </span><span class="calibre9">had finally</span><span class="calibre9"> announced the end of club activities.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Actually, I wanted to leave early so that I could talk with Akari, but I can’t say, </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">“I want to accompany my sister, so please let me take a break from the club.”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, I have to think of another excuse…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Looking back this morning, I guess it </span><span class="calibre9">would be more</span><span class="calibre9"> difficult to talk with Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’ll try my best tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, Yusuke, do you have a little time after this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I was about to leave, Nanami approached me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, I </span><span class="calibre9">have</span><span class="calibre9"> some time. What do you want?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I wanna talk… </span><span class="calibre9">about what</span><span class="calibre9"> happened yesterday.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, I guess I </span><span class="calibre9">would</span><span class="calibre9"> have to make things clear…</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I don’t know how far into “</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">yesterday</span></i><span class="calibre9">” </span><span class="calibre9">she wanted to talk about</span><span class="calibre9">, but I </span><span class="calibre9">couldn‘t</span><span class="calibre9"> refuse.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, well, I got this strange feeling.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">From the look on her face, it didn’t seem like </span><span class="calibre9">it would be</span><span class="calibre9"> a pleasant conversation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry to take up so much of your time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I stopped at a cafe near the school and listened to what Nanami had to say.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, that’s fine. What’s the matter?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, </span><span class="calibre9">the thing is…</span><span class="calibre9">&nbsp; Well, how should I say it?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She looked as if she was having a hard time saying something and </span><span class="calibre9">was</span><span class="calibre9"> worried about </span><span class="calibre9">my reaction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m not sure what to say… Well I know, but I have to tell you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">&mdash;And what is it?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know, yesterday when they were arguing, I felt something.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hm.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I think Akari-chan likes you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Wha&mdash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m just making a guess, but it’s </span><span class="calibre9">possible</span><span class="calibre9">.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She continued </span><span class="calibre9">while</span><span class="calibre9"> I was stunned by </span><span class="calibre9">her</span><span class="calibre9"> remark.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I believe </span><span class="calibre9">she’s ignoring</span><span class="calibre9"> you not because she hates you, </span><span class="calibre9">but because</span><span class="calibre9"> she likes you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, no, it can’t be possible.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What</span><span class="calibre9"> was</span><span class="calibre9"> she talking about all of a sudden?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ve always thought that she didn’t like you.</span><span class="calibre9"> If everyone saw her usual attitude, they would believe that was the case, until now</span><span class="calibre9">.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But, like I said before, I’ve always thought there was something wrong with her. You used to be so close, but then she changed too much…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I think that’s what she said when she came to my house on Friday.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“</span><span class="calibre9">I wanted to check out something, that’s</span><span class="calibre9"> why I invited you two on a date. Of course, it’s also to help you, but…if she didn’t hate you then and if there’s another reason… then what you’re trying to do </span><span class="calibre9">now</span> <span class="calibre9">is meaningless</span><span class="calibre9">.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her words hit right on the mark.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So… how did she look in your eyes?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“To be honest, I don’t think she hates you. Rather, she likes you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But that’s…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“</span><span class="calibre9">Remember</span><span class="calibre9"> your argument with senpai </span><span class="calibre9">yesterday</span><span class="calibre9">?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Intercepting my words, Nanami </span><span class="calibre9">continued</span><span class="calibre9">,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Before that, I was alone with Akari-chan. When you left to make a phone call, I told her the reason why we were on a date. I said, ‘The reason why I invited you </span><span class="calibre9">was</span><span class="calibre9"> because Yusuke’s acquaintance wants to be friends with you. And that’s why Yusuke </span><span class="calibre9">was</span><span class="calibre9"> trying to fix his relationship with you, Akari-chan’.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Why </span><span class="calibre9">would</span><span class="calibre9"> you tell that lie to Akari…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And she seemed very upset when she heard that. Rather than being surprised, I saw a very sad expression on her face… After that, she left her seat and ran away immediately.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“This much happened without my knowledge…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And the most important thing happened after that. Do you remember what Akari-chan was going to say when you were arguing with Yamamoto-senpai?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That… Akari is…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“‘</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">You’ve said enough… Don’t you dare to utter a single word about my Onii-chan.’</span></i><span class="calibre9"> After that, she said </span><span class="calibre9">that</span> <i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">her</span></i><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9"> brother </span></i><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">was</span></i><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9"> more attractive</span></i><span class="calibre9">. Without a doubt, you weren’t hated by Akari-chan.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well… it could be true.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What Nanami </span><span class="calibre9">said</span> <span class="calibre9">was </span><span class="calibre9">exactly the truth. Yesterday, Akari was furious for my sake because Yamamoto </span><span class="calibre9">spoke</span><span class="calibre9"> nonsense about me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So, I’m just guessing from here, but I’m sure that Akari-chan likes you. But for some reason, </span><span class="calibre9">she‘s keeping</span><span class="calibre9"> her distance. I don’t know what it is, but…maybe she ‘</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">likes’</span></i><span class="calibre9"> you more than we think.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Ah… Now I’m in trouble.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It may have been careless of me to ask Nanami and the others for advice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I understand what you’re trying to say, but I just can’t believe it. The way she has been acting so far doesn’t seem like it.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, I’m just guessing. It’s not like I have any proof. But I’m sure I’m not wrong.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She </span><span class="calibre9">was</span><span class="calibre9"> confident </span><span class="calibre9">despite</span><span class="calibre9"> the lack of confirmation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“But if Akari… likes me, isn’t it strange to keep a distance? We’re </span><span class="calibre9">siblings</span><span class="calibre9">, and if she doesn’t hate me, then at least she can be a little more friendly.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s why. As I said earlier, I </span><span class="calibre9">think the ‘</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">like’</span></i><span class="calibre9"> that she feels is different from what</span><span class="calibre9"> we imagine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Do you mean she…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, she likes you as a man, that’s what I’m saying.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hypothetically speaking, Nanami was indeed correct.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So you’re saying that Akari has feelings for me, but she’s holding back because I’m her brother?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, I think it’s fair to say that. If she keeps her distance, only then she can control her emotions towards you. And this explains why she was acting like that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…!!</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So you’re saying that Akari has feelings for me, but she’s holding back because I’m her brother?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I think it’s fair to say that. If she keeps her distance, only then she can control her emotions towards you. And this explains why she was acting like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">…!!</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wonder if Nanami knew more than that. She said, “Akari likes her brother as a man.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">But Nanami didn’t realize that Akari’s love for me was so twisted that she even had planned to imprison me in the future.</p>

<p class="calibre4">If Nanami was aware of it then this atmosphere would be even more tense.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If that’s true, then what am I supposed to do? I can’t just back down right after making a promise with my acquaintance.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Since Nanami was getting to the root of the real problem, I have to cover it with more lies. I don’t wanna increase her suspicions, so I’ll play smoothly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just came up with a solution, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nanami looked at me as if she’s looking deep into the future.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Rather than using force to make her give up, don’t you think it would be better if something happens and she willingly gives up on her own?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s true.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“I think it would be best if you just tell Akari-chan to give up, but that would be impossible.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just hypothetical… And if that’s really the case, I agree the best thing would be if she gave up on her own. I would like to fix it as soon as possible.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“If that’s what you think then…why don’t you just get a girlfriend, Yusuke?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The sudden suggestion caused my voice to leak out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you have a girlfriend, then Akari-chan would give up on you. If the person she likes had a boyfriend or girlfriend, I think that’d be enough to give up… What do you think?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">… So, what about that?</p>


<p class="calibre4">Certainly it’s a good theory. But… when it comes to Akari, it doesn’t seem to make any sense.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, due to lack of information, Nanami’s reasoning is 50/50.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I know what you are trying to say, but… I can’t, because I don’t have anyone to date.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You do!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Where?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m saying that you should…go out with me because…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The tone of her voice gradually decreased. But my ears didn’t miss a word of what she had said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I…with you? What?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Would you hate it if it’s me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nanami looked at me sheepishly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s the first time I’ve seen her like this. But, I guess she’s cute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not that… It’s just that, I was surprised with the bomb you just dropped. Will you be fine with this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After my reply, Nanami sighed heavily.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh… I thought you were dumb, but I didn’t expect this much…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Dumb… Me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Who else is here?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was stunned by her remark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And the way she put it, it’s like…</p>


<p class="calibre4">“It sounds like you like me …”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… I mean, you said it right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">…Huh?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait… you’re not joking right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you think it’s some kind of joke?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was sheer determination in her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It doesn’t look like she’s joking.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry I’m saying this all of a sudden. It’s annoying, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s not.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If you’d ask me, she wasn’t annoying at all.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m a man. And I couldn’t help but feel happy if my friend confessed her feelings for me. But, whether or not to accept this confession is another matter.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s not that I hate Nanami. I like her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, I like her as a friend… To be honest, I’ve never seen her as a girl before. And then there’s Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t be in a relationship until I stop Akari’s plan at least…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;But you know.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">Nanami broke the silence for me who had trouble answering.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not that I want an answer right now, it’s just that I want you to take your time and think about it…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But… that’ll be…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s fine, I want to do it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nanami wanted to ‘hold off on answering her confession’.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It would only prolong the answer.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There’s no way I could do something like that… It’s true that I am grateful to her however, my answer would be no. I like Nanami, but I couldn’t return her feelings.</p>


<p class="calibre4">But if I did, our relationship would surely change drastically. I’m sure we won’t be able to spend time together like before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wanted to avoid that if I could…</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m aware that what I’m saying wasn’t convenient, but I don’t want to break my relationship with her. She had been my best friend for more than 10 years.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well then, the real thing starts now!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Real thing?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I don’t want you to forget about my confession, but it would be nice if you could put it aside for a while. And what I really wanted to tell you is that, would you pretend to date me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Pretend…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What does she mean by that…?</p>


<p class="calibre4">“As I said before, if Akari-chan likes you, then I think you should get a girlfriend to make her give up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That, well…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But, right now, you don’t have anyone to ask to be your girlfriend.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So… you’re saying that you’re the only one who’s willing for the job?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s correct. And this’ll be also a trial run.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Trial?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yusuke, you don’t like me?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“No way! That’s not…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess you’ve never seen me as a girl, have you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well…yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a little bit shameful to point that out, but it’s a fact.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll help you with Akari-chan and at the same time, I wanted to remove myself from the frame of just a friend. If you don’t like me after pretending to go out with me, I’ll give up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Too many things are happening at once and I feel like my head is going to explode, but I understand what she’s trying to say.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s true that I don’t like Nanami as a girl right now. But that’s only because I’ve never looked at her that way, but I don’t know if it could change my mind…</p>

<p class="calibre4">To be honest, I don’t think this is the best idea… But considering Nanami’s feelings, it was hard to say no.</p>


<p class="calibre4">So, after pondering for a while, I came to a conclusion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay. I don’t know what will happen but I’ll go with your plan.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t have high hopes for getting ‘Akari to give up’, but… I don’t know what’s going to happen with this one.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt guilty like I’m playing with her, but I couldn’t say no.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really? I’m so happy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She smiled at my answer. Seeing her expression, I told myself that at least it was better than making her sad.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s only temporary but I’m looking forward to it.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. I still feel a little bad, but thanks for your help.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ll think about it and give her an answer as soon as possible. No matter what the result is, we can’t keep doing this forever.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now then, Akari-chan is my top priority.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll let her know about it. Of course, I’ll hide the fact that I’m pretending. I don’t think it will change anything…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m not sure how she’ll react when I tell her we’ve started dating. I can’t predict it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But I do know this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She won’t welcome it, and I’m sure she won’t give up on me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help it, but Akari’s fondness for me was not something to be taken lightly of.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wonder what would happen…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not sure if I’m right, but for now, I’m going to put Akari-chan first. I’m sure you’ll agree with me for that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, since we’ve come this far, there is no turning back.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ll tell Akari about our ‘relationship’ first and see what would happen.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Maybe I should’ve reconsider my plans… Well, there’s a little hope.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“And one more thing. I want you to tell her, ‘Thanks to you, Akari-chan, we were able to go out’.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s fine, but… what do you mean by ‘thanks to Akari’?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“She’ll know what it means, so you don’t have to worry, Yusuke. Please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thanks to Akari? Well, it’s true that we’re talking about this because of yesterday’s incident. I guess I wasn’t entirely wrong.</p>


<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I finished my consultation with Nanami and returned home, the clock had already passed 8 o’clock.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I checked with my mom and she told me that Akari was in her room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nanami and I settled on the idea that I would only tell people close to me that we had started dating. I’ll tell Yoshiki tomorrow, but first I have to deal with Akari.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now then Yusuke, let’s have dinner.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The whole family gathered at the table. The best time to do this would be after dinner, when everyone has left the table.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Thank you for the meal.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At times like this, my family’s custom of having dinner together came in handy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After dinner, I followed Akari who had just put away the dishes and was walking back to her room. Okay, if we’re upstairs then my parents won’t hear me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s only an act, and I don’t want my mom to know about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akari, I need to talk to you about something.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her footsteps stopped as she climbed the stairs.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Actually, Nanami and I started dating.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As expected, there was no reply.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know why but Nanami said that, ‘We were able to date thanks to Akari-chan’.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I told her what Nanami had asked me to say. Well, it wouldn’t be unnatural if there was some kind of reason behind this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Maybe she said it lightly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Akari…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">At that moment, her expression changed. She trembled.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… She really did it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t hear her words clearly, she mumbled something and went back to her room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">There was no way I could follow her, so I kept watching.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did it work…?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The only thing I could do was to mutter to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, I guess I’ll find out later when I check her notes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">.</p>
<p class="calibre4">.</p>
<p class="calibre4">.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After sometime, I went to Akari’s room to check her Note as usual, and found that today’s page was left blank.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, she would sometimes write after taking a bath, and I used to read them all together the next day… But for today, I thought it was definitely updated.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But what’s this anxiety I’m feeling…</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was concerned about Akari. But from now on, I would have to face her as Nanami’s (temporary) boyfriend.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I met her at the dining table where breakfast was being prepared.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did Mom and Dad leave first?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I entered the living room, checking the front door, I met Akari who was having breakfast. It was the start of my silent breakfast with her, which has become a regular event these days.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Good morning, Akari.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I greeted her as usual. And while I was in this dilemma, I heard something unexpected…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;Good morning, Onii-chan.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">… W-wait!? What did I just hear?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…? What’s wrong, Onii-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Really?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s my line! What’s wrong with you?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re Akari… right?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“What are you talking about? If you don’t eat soon, you’ll be late.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Because it was weird that…she was talking with me normally.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Onii-chan!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I was concerned, she pushed me even further.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Would you like to go to school with me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Nanami… it’s going to be tough.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know what, Akari?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What, Onii-chan?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">We walked side by side as if it was natural. On the way to school, I regained my composure and asked the most obvious question to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, what happened to you all of a sudden?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yesterday, she avoided me, but today, her attitude suddenly changed. There was no way it could be possible, or rather, my heart wasn’t prepared to accept it honestly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There isn’t anything special. I thought you’ve been trying hard for me, so it would be wrong to ignore you forever.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">No matter how I looked at it, it was a lie. I felt the agitation in her words!</p>

<p class="calibre4">At first glance, she seemed to be a perfect beauty, but she is weak with ad-libs. I don’t know how she was normal, but she had more loose ends than one could imagine.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Anyway, I’m going to let myself be fooled here.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad to hear that. It’s good to have a chat with you again.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/9HVTjbk/157-1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">When I said that, she blushed and became quiet. However, this time, it was more like she was having trouble answering than ignoring.</p>

<p class="calibre4">All right, let’s sort out the situation while we’re at it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yesterday, I told her that I started going out with Nanami. Then this morning, her attitude suddenly changed. She had been ignoring me, but now she started talking to me normally as if nothing happened, and we were going to school together.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m pretty sure it was linked to yesterday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her note wasn’t updated, and I would’ve noticed if it was this blatant. I’m not sure how she changed because Nanami and I started dating.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Or rather, if Akari is willing to talk to me like this, don’t I need to worry about her plan anymore, I guess?</p>

<p class="calibre4">The reason why she had been ignoring me was to show that she hated me. And yet, she didn’t seem to mind that we were going to school together as siblings, and in fact, she’s inviting me over.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In other words, it’s the result that I was hoping for. I don’t know why, but I have this bad feeling.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Um, Onii-chan. I want to ask you something, is that fine?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Akari who had been silent up till now, asked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“W-what?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How should I… you and Haruse-san started… dating, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh… Yes, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Which one of you confessed first?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Confession? Well, it was Nanami.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. Okay, thanks.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After that, she went silent.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What…? What did she mean by that question?</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was so confused by the change that I began to suspect that there was a meaning behind each of her words.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What exactly are you plotting, Akari?</p>





<p class="calibre4">“Akari-chan did that?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">After that, we parted ways without any further conversation and went to the classroom. I told Nanami who was waiting for me about what happened this morning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought Nanami would be surprised, but…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It wasn’t the reaction I was expecting. Rather, she looked as if to say, “I knew it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Doesn’t that surprise you, Nanami?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Of course I’m surprised. I was surprised to see the results so quickly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What kind of?”</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I had a hunch. But you don’t need to worry about that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If she told me like that, I would be curious… I wonder if it’s a woman’s secret power.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what are you going to do now?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know, you’re helping your friend to get together with Akari, right? Now that you can talk with each other again, isn’t this a good opportunity?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I forgot for a moment, that’s how it was supposed to be.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I guess I will have to see how it goes. I haven’t been able to keep up with all the sudden changes, so I’ll have to wait.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">When I told her that, her reply was, “I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I must check Akari’s note tonight. There’s no doubt that something wasn’t going right, and if I look at it, I might be able to find some clues.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey… Yusuke.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know, we’re sort of dating, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but be embarrassed, when Nanami told me so.</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s right. I was preoccupied with Akari’s sudden change, and forgot that Nanami and I started dating yesterday. Even though our relationship is temporary, I learned that Nanami has feelings for me.</p>


<p class="calibre4">“Of course. I’m worried about Akari, but that’s not the same as this. To be honest with you, I’m still sorting out my own feelings. But it’s not like that I’ll ignore you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I told her, Nanami said,</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, would you like to go out with me this Saturday? You know, that day it was the three of us, but this time we’ll be all alone.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">…Is this what they call an invitation for a date?</p>

<p class="calibre4">There had been many occasions when Nanami and I had gone out together, but this time it would be different. Yes, as a couple, so it would definitely be a date.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is that a…no? If you’re busy, we can go another day.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Perhaps because there was no response from me, Nanami looked worried. No, it wasn’t that I have plans or anything like that… I was just surprised.</p>



<p class="calibre4">“Ah! It’s Saturday, right? Yeah, I don’t have anything to do so I’m free.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really? If so, how about a movie? There’s a movie that’s been getting a lot of popularity, and it could be a good reference for our club.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A movie? Yeah, that sounds good. So let’s go there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s a safe choice for a date spot, and she seems excited. I guess I’m fine with it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well then, I’ll call you later.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After that, Nanami went back to her seat.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m also concerned about Akari. I’m also the one who decided to go out with Nanami. For now, I have to get along with both of them.</p>




<p class="calibre4">“Slowly-Slowly..”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I was lost in thought, someone tapped my shoulder from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So it’s you. What’s up, Yoshiki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I just listened to your conversation. So tell me, did you finally get into that kind of relationship?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you heard that… Well, I guess you can say that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yoshiki had a very surprised expression on his face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, really? I didn’t realize that you had a crush on Haruse. There wasn’t any sign of it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haha… well…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In fact, it’s an act, but I have to keep quiet.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So I guess Nanami confessed, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes. She did. Wait, you knew about it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You! I didn’t think it was possible, but… Didn’t you notice it? Everyone knows that Haruse likes you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">By the way, Nanami once told me that I’m “dumb”. I couldn’t believe that it was this obvious.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, congratulations. I’ve been wondering when you guys were going to get together, and I think I’ve finally gotten it off my chest.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haha, thanks…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m not sure how I’m going to explain this if I reject Nanami’s confession… Yoshiki seems to be completely convinced of our relationship. If I would say, “Actually, we were pretending to be together, and I dumped Nanami…” Wouldn’t that be too much of a shock?</p>

<p class="calibre4">No, it’s my fault for withholding a response to her confession in the first place…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Yusuke, are things going well with Akari-chan?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, about that, you can forget about it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I think I’ve solved it… Yeah, I’m still not sure, but I don’t think it’s a problem anymore.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is that so? Well, if it’s okay with you, then it’s fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was on my mind that I should tell him about the change in Akari, but I didn’t know the reason yet, so I decided not to.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, for starters, good luck with your weekend date.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With a rather unpleasant smile on his face, he patted me on the shoulder twice and went back to his seat. I’m used to being teased about Akari, but now I’m going to be teased about Nanami too…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, I’d better get going.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As night fell, I made sure that Akari was headed for the bath and sneaked into her room to check the Note.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t believe that she greeted me with a “welcome home” and talked to me during dinner as if it was a normal thing to do.</p>

<p class="calibre4">My parents, especially my mother, were quite surprised, but they were in a good mood because they had always wanted us to be friends.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now my mom and dad will think that we have completely reconciled. The fact that Akari is okay with this means that she has given up on the plan.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Anyway, if I read her notes, I’ll find out the truth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I felt like I’m cheating on a test, but I couldn’t help it because I could actually find out almost everything about Akari by reading this notebook. The only drawback is that it contains just as much information about myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… yesterday’s page…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I turn the page as usual. Today is July 14th, so if you check from the 12th… Ha!</p>


<p class="calibre4">” ”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I opened the last page, which was supposed to be the latest page. But for some reason, the notebook stopped on July 12th, when the three of us had our date, and there was nothing written after that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s going on?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hadn’t checked it thoroughly yesterday, but it seems to have not been updated since the day of our date.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Could it be that she forgot to write two days in a row?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I immediately denied what I had just said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Until today, Akari had never missed a day in her diary. And yet, she hasn’t written anything for two days. Something is wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I checked another page just to be sure, but again, there seemed to be no entries.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“She stopped writing the…notes?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That was all I could think of at the moment. Perhaps this has something to do with her change. However, if there is nothing written in the Note, which should contain the answer, then I will never know.</p>

<p class="calibre4">In the end, I left the room without learning anything that night.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Saturday came.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Umm, Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It had been five days since Akari’s attitude changed.</span><span class="calibre9"> Slowly, but surely, I was getting familiar with the new Akari… But, I still had yet to figure out the reason for her change in attitude.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-What happened?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“How are things with Haruse-san?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hm? With Nanami?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You said you started dating just a while ago. I was wondering how it’s going,” she asked.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What’s in her mind? She asked me in a way that sounds like she is worried for her older brother who just found a girlfriend, but it’s quite obvious that the meaning behind those words is something besides that, even if she asks innocently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Since I couldn’t read her thoughts, I thought it was best to tell her the truth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm, we’ve known each other for a long time as friends, so it’s not that big of a deal… But… today we’re going to the theatre.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Tsk…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And then… did you just say something?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nope?” she subtly denied.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, no, no, she clicked her tongue just now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Anyway, Onii-chan, it looks like it’s going to rain today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, the weather forecast said it’s going to be sunny.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was surprised at how easily she lied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And the weather didn’t really matter because we were going to the movie theater…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, if you say so…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This time, she seemed to be thinking really hard… I couldn’t hear what she was muttering, but I’m sure it was something bad.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I thought that Akari might have reformed a bit after her recent changes in behavior, but, surprisingly, the root of the problem didn’t change.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She hasn’t been updating her Notes lately, so I could only guess. However, when I interacted with her like this, I realized that she has an easy-to-understand personality.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She’s the type of person who unexpectedly expresses her thoughts aloud. Even though I was pretending not to notice when she murmured</span><span class="calibre9">: Haruse-san is a bit too much.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari was still not aware that I knew she had feelings for me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well then, I’ve to go,” I said hurriedly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was still plenty of time till the meeting, but I knew that if I prolong this conversation, my facade may fall apart.</span><span class="calibre9"> I’m not sure how long we can keep this up.</span> <span class="calibre9">I don’t know how much longer Nanami and I can keep up this act without being exposed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">***</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">… Something’s off and this situation feels strange.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Thirty minutes after leaving home, I was thinking about this as I waited for Nanami to arrive in front of the station.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Though we planned a movie date, it wasn’t truly the matter of my concern.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even if we’re in a fake relationship, going to the movie theater with a girl, there’s no way I wasn’t looking forward to it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s just that… my sister is keeping an eye on me from afar. If it wasn’t for this fact, I’d be happy at this moment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari was staring at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It felt as if I was haunted by a suspicious shadow. Although she was wearing a mask and a baseball cap as a disguise, I knew it was her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Why did I know that it was her? Because she had been stalking me ever since I left home.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I noticed a shadow, </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">her</span></i><span class="calibre9"> shadow, following me about three minutes after I left the house.</span> <span class="calibre9">If she wanted to go unnoticed, it would’ve been better for her to camouflage a little more. She should have at least came out after a time delay… I pushed down the urge to advise the assailant, and came to the station, hoping on the slim possibility that it might have been my imagination… The suspicious figure following me did not disappear until the very end and came this far.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I didn’t expect her to follow me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, I was pretending to be unaware.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was probably thinking that by wearing a disguise, she could follow me anywhere without </span><span class="calibre9">me knowing</span><span class="calibre9">. But if I call out to her, then it’d be a hassle to deal with her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, if she’s just gonna watch me from a distance, then it’s fine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, I know this situation is abnormal, but there’s nothing I can do about it. I’ll just have to be careful to make sure this date </span><span class="calibre9">ends</span> <span class="calibre9">without a hitch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But, It won’t allow me to concentrate on my date with Nanami…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry! Sorry to keep you waiting!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I was pondering over this, I heard Nanami’s voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She must have spotted me from the ticket gate and ran here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Good morning, Nanami. It’s okay, I just arrived a bit early.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry about that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She apologised again while trying to catch her breath.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I noticed Nanami was wearing clothes suited for summer</span><span class="calibre9">, but I wasn’t sure if she’s as cute as Akari. Although, I had to say she looked pretty cute too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, by the way, the movie starts at 2 PM, right? There’s still time, do you want to have lunch first?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, that’s why I chose this time. I heard there’s a restaurant that serves very tasty Omurice, so I wanted to go with you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I see, we’ll have lunch first, and then watch the movie.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I clicked the navigation app and searched for the restaurant. It was about a ten-minute walk from here.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well then, let’s go.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When we were about to move, Nanami looked at me as if she wanted to say something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The expression on her face was as if she was saying: </span><span class="calibre9">Take a hint</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…Oh, right.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Your outfit suits you very well. You’re looking great.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We’re on a date. And it’s my duty as a man to compliment a woman’s outfit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’m sure that’s what Nanami wants to hear.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Oh, thanks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She gave me a more embarrassed look than I expected. It was as if the answer I hadn’t expected had come back to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Or. Was there any mistake…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, I mean, that’s what I think.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I looked away in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“T-that… is what I wanted to hear, you know?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As she said that, Nanami with an embarrassed look on her face, hugged my right arm.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…wait a minute.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“N-Nanami!?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Y-you see. We’re l-lovers, right? If so, isn’t it normal for us to link our arms…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I felt the warmth of her body as she stuck close to me. And… they’re soft.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Oh, this is not good.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’ve never been conscious of her as a girl until now, but when we’re this close, </span><span class="calibre9">all kinds of thoughts go through my head: she’s a girl… she’s beautiful… she’s cute…. and so on.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, I heard from Yoshiki that Nanami is also very popular </span><span class="calibre9">amongst boys</span><span class="calibre9">. She’s also one of the top three beauties in the school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s impossible for me to be unaware of it when a girl like her shows this much affection for me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um… Eh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s funny. I’ve never had trouble having a conversation with Nanami, but now that I’m so embarrassed, I don’t know what to say.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After a few moments of silence…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Let’s go…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Piriririririri</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Just as we were about to move, my smartphone rang.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3h3PrBN/174-1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry Nanami, it’s a phone call.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I said this, she unclasped my arms. Ah, I regretted saying that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Who’s calling?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I pulled my smartphone out of my pocket and looked at the screen.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">[Incoming call: Akari Namiki]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Oh no, I was so excited that I completely forgot that Akari was watching me from somewhere at this very moment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “Hello, what’s up?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I answered the call as normal while trying to be calm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “O-Onii-chan. What’d you like for dinner tonight?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “So, dinner. I was wondering what you wanted to eat.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “Do I have to answer that now?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “Yeah, well. I’m out for groceries.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What a brazen lie.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “Ah, then curry is fine. Curry, OK.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">|| “Curry, all right… Then come home early, okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The call ended. The conversation lasted about 20 seconds. But there’s no point saying that by a call. A text message would have been better.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Was that Akari-chan?” Nanami asked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I </span><span class="calibre9">turned off</span><span class="calibre9"> the screen and answered her question.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah. She’s out shopping, so she was asking what we should eat for dinner.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm… I see.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I felt nervous at her remark.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, then we’ve to move now. If we don’t hurry, it might get crowded.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, we have to hurry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We walked towards the store while maintaining some distance between us. Nanami and I were unable to cross our arms again&mdash; otherwise, it’d be impossible to make our way through the crowd.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yum, it’s so good!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We arrived at the restaurant thirty minutes ago. The fluffy, soft boiled Omurice that was brought to us was truly a masterpiece.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Indeed, it’s delicious.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My thoughts slipped out naturally.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was afternoon, but the restaurant was already packed.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There were couples beside us, families with children, and even a group of housewives,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was a restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere where people of all ages and backgrounds could enjoy their meals.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yusuke ordered beef stew sauce, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s right. I had a hard time deciding between this and the one that Nanami ordered with </span><span class="calibre9">ketchup</span><span class="calibre9"> but in the end I went with this one.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Next time, </span><span class="calibre9">I’d like to try the dish with ketchup</span><span class="calibre9">. I’ll definitely come back here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And then, as if she heard my thoughts, Nanami made a suggestion.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, do you want to trade for a bit?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“By trading, do you mean exchanging each other’s…?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, I’ve been wondering about the beef stew sauce too!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That was a nice offer. Indeed, I was happy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;Then, ahhh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Eh, all of a sudden I lost my appetite.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“N-Nanami… that’s a bit too…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“H-here. I’m pretty embarrassed too, so hurry up and take it…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">N-No-no. I wasn’t embarrassed or anything. Yeah, I mean, there was a little bit of embarrassment, but not that.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You’re not going to eat…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami looked worried when I froze up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, I shouldn’t. Even if Akari might be watching from somewhere…</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9"> I can’t leave. I have to eat it. </span></i><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Let’s</span></i><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9"> dig in.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">*Crack&mdash;&mdash;-*</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“M-miss! Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I was about to take a bite out of the spoon that Nanami offered me, I heard a loud sound from the other side of the restaurant. It sounded as if something broke, possibly a cup. I stopped moving.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Please wait a moment while we take care of this right away!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The staff started to move </span><span class="calibre9">in a panic</span><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">[…………..]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While the restaurant was in turmoil, Nanami and I felt awkward around each other. After a few moments of staring at each other, she gently took the spoon that was pointed in my direction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that, I quietly took a bite from my Omurice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Without a doubt, that girl was Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Let’s see, which movie are we going to watch today?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After leaving the restaurant, we arrived at our destination for the day, the movie theater. It’s about twenty minutes until the screening. Just in time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Today, we’re going to watch a popular anime movie, it’s called, </span><span class="calibre9">‘</span><span class="calibre9">What’s Your Name</span><span class="calibre9">’.</span><span class="calibre9">”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We will be watching an animated movie then. Well, since I rarely watch movies and I know this one is popular it means I can look forward to watching this.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I tell Nanami, “I’ll go buy two tickets then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sure! Umm… Can I go with you?” she asks.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Look, It’s on me. You see, it’s a date, and a guy has to look cool, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yusuke… Um, guess I’ll have to accept your offer then. she giggles in response.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Sorry Nanami, I hope you’ll take this as an apology.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was the least I could do to make up for the interference I had been receiving from Akari all day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“So let’s go inside.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I bought tickets for the two of us and entered the theater. Well then our seats…</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, this is it, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Right in the middle of the theater, not too far from the screen and not too close. Guess, we could get the best view from here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Besides, if we were in a movie theater, Akari wouldn’t be able to disturb us. Neither be a phone call nor any loud noises.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Phew… finally I could take a breath.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;-Ah!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But it lasted for a few seconds, when I saw a suspicious figure emerge from the entrance, I couldn’t help but exclaim.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um? What’s wrong?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“O-oh, no, it’s nothing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The strange shadow that had been stalking me all morning walked past our seats and stopped one row behind us. Then she sat down with a bang on the seat right behind us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, no, no. Wasn’t that too bold?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Fortunately, Nanami, who was sitting next to me, was so absorbed in the pamphlet she had just purchased that she didn’t seem to notice the suspicious presence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, she could have noticed at any moment because she was right behind her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um, Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um, I was wondering if you wanted to read the brochure.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah, the… pamphlet… Yeah, I’ll read it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I gently reached for the pamphlet, trying not to let my agitation be noticed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I flipped through the cover, I saw a big banner that said, “All of Japan cried!” </span><span class="calibre9">What an absurd phrase.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… It was ironic. I hadn’t even seen the end yet, and I was moved to tears.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In the meantime, the movie was about to reach its climax.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At first, I couldn’t concentrate on the movie because I was worried about Akari, but she didn’t seem to be interfering in any way. Guess she was enjoying the movie and would talk about her impressions after the end.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">[The story begins when the hero and heroine used to be lovers. But one day, the heroine suddenly breaks up with him…&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">While the hero is grieving, another heroine appears who takes a liking to him. The two get together, but in a corner of his mind, he can’t forget the first heroine.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">One day, he happens to drop by a hospital and is reunited with the first heroine. At that time, he finds out that she was diagnosed with a disease and has said goodbye to the hero to avoid bothering him.</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">The hero, who can’t forget the heroine, rushes to take care of her, but the other heroine, who is dating the hero, doesn’t like it…]</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But, I had a strange feeling…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, I wasn’t criticizing this film.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The scene where he happened to meet the first heroine again was so touching that I almost cried like a baby.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, from the moment he said goodbye to his second girlfriend, the development of the story became strange… The scene where she confronts the hero, the voice actor’s performance was so earnest that it made me shudder.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This was a romance movie, right? Not a horror movie, correct?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">[……]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I glanced next to her, I saw that Nanami was fully focused on the screen. It was as if she couldn’t take her eyes off the screen and was absorbed in the film.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well it was good that… Nanami was enjoying the movie.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I adjusted my position and put my arm on the armrest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…m!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And then Nanami gently put her hand on top of mine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I felt my heart skip a beat and I could feel it beating faster.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Such an irony that a girl was holding my hand while watching a romantic movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I felt her body warmth through my hand. Then just like the couples she intervened my fingers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“AH&ndash; I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At that moment, I heard </span><span class="calibre9">murmuring</span><span class="calibre9"> behind me, and something flew into the air in large amounts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">[[…..?]]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Both of us panicked and pulled our hands back. Those were… Popcorns?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Excuse me. Umm… These popcorn… they just… Oh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami picked up the popcorn and told the person behind her.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Wait, behind her was…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… There’s no one.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I turned around, there was no one. But Akari was there just a while ago. I was sure that I heard her mumbling throughout the movie. And she was definitely my sister, Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But now, I couldn’t see anyone behind us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari, when did she leave?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-well, there’s some movie left. I’ll tell the staff later.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We couldn’t bother the people around us. I guess we had caused enough trouble for now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">[[……]]</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And so, with an awkward atmosphere, we looked back at the screen. Guess, we were not in the mood to hold hands again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Waa&ndash; It was fun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, it was.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The movie ended without any strange incident. After breathing a sigh of relief we hoped on the train.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At least, I managed to get the staff to put away the popcorn by apologizing desperately to them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Both Nanami and the staff reacted like, “You don’t have to apologize so much when the customer behind you throws it,” but no, I had to apologize as much as I could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was really sorry for the trouble that my sister caused…</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know, the scene where the second heroine cries and chases after the hero was… something that touched my heart.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami expressed her impressions with enthusiasm. It’s true that the scene was memorable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-what should we do now?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It is about 4:30 PM now., Iit was a little early to go home, but Akari said she would be making curry and she might be waiting… Guess I should go home now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know, there’s one last place I want to go. Are you fine with it?” Nanami said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Where is it?” I asked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um, will you please follow me.” she requested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Nanami took me in the direction of our houses. After a while we just walked straight past our houses and continued.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s been a long time…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I followed her without being told where she was going, Nanami stopped in front of a small park. There were children’s slides, swings and a sandbox. It wasn’t a place for high school students like us to stop by, but rather a place for children to play.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, do you remember this park?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But I got a hint of what she was trying to say and why we came here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Of course. It’s </span><span class="calibre9">nostalgic</span><span class="calibre9">.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s right, we used to play here a lot.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When we were little we used to play here all the time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The slide, the swings, all of it were engraved in my memories.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I remembered the time when we were in kindergarten, I got hurt and you came to comfort me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I don’t remember that happening…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I blurted it out, Nanami chuckled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You did… I would never forget that moment. How could you forget?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was unexpectedly shaken by her expressions, which was tinted by the sunset.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I have been watching my childhood friend since we were kids, but remembering these past few days, I feel like I’m experiencing a lot of emotions I never felt before.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know, I think it was probably… the moment, I fell in love with you, Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I never knew… confessions could be so embarrassing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The other day when she told me her feelings, I was surprised and confused. But this time it wasn’t like that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We got in a relationship, then went on a date… And now she was confessing her feelings for me again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nanami… I…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;&ndash;ONII CHAN!!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I opened my mouth, wondering how I should answer, I heard a voice calling me from somewhere.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It should be her, the only one who calls me “Onii-chan”.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh… You’re also here, Haruse-san. Greetings.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She glanced at Nanami, who was right next to me, and came closer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Ah, so you’ve finally decided to show up.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What a coincidence, Akari-chan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Coincidence!! There was no way it would be a mere coincidence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s really a coincidence. I never thought we’d meet here,” Akari lied.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari and Nanami, the two of them, were confronting each other. When they went out together in the past, the atmosphere was a little more relaxed… But for some reason, this time I felt a chill surrounding those two.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The three way confrontation continued, and then Akari said,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Now that you’re here, I would like to ask something to you, Haruse san.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm. What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Back at the coffee shop, you told me why my Onii-chan’s attitude changed, didn’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I heard that the reason you bought the swimsuit was for your date with him.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I was trying to be thoughtful… Did I bother you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No, not at all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After listening to their conversation, I began to regret that I should have consulted Nanami for a different reason. Normally, no one would like to talk with a girl they didn’t know, especially if it was Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And I… I’ve never dated a man before or anything like that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, I suppose so. I’d be rather surprised if she did.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, I see. I thought you were cute so you had a lot of experience with that kind of thing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And, I don’t want to be asked out for a date out of blue.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">You know you could just say, “I don’t have any plans at the moment.”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;-So”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’d like to practice it with my Onii-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hm…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’ll be best if it’s Onii-chan, because he’s family. And you don’t even have to worry about it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…What do you mean by practice?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Ignoring Nanami’s question, Akari turned to me and said,</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um, Onii-chan. Tomorrow… Will you go to the pool with me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… What?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Excuse me, Haruse-san. May I borrow your boyfriend?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Umm… what about my opinion?</span></i></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Did I make some mistake and skipped a day…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I checked the date on the calendar. </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Ah, it’s Sunday.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">*Sigh*</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I thought of today’s schedule I felt the urge to scratch my head. Today the two of us planned to go to the swimming pool.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She proclaimed that it was just a “practice date.” But I knew that was a lie.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In the first place, even if my story was supposed to be true, Akari would never go out with a stranger. She may have said so, but I know from years of experience that it’s impossible.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Sadly, the note was never updated, and I still didn’t know the reason for her sudden change in attitude. And also, I didn’t even know why she invited me on a date all of a sudden, and to be honest, I’m freaking out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It could be on a whim… or simply an insult to Nanami, but since she’s my sister, it was also possible that she genuinely wanted to go out with me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yesterday’s interference, and then today’s date.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Guess I would be able to achieve my original goal of stopping Akari’s plan, but I wondered if it was okay to let her do whatever she wants.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The reason why I originally approached her was to stop that horrible plan. If I relate it then the current situation was seemingly turning in my favor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, the difference was that now I had two girls to watch out for.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I should stop doing things half-heartedly with Nanami, who confessed her love to me with sincerity.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And in the future, I’ve to face Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">All these thoughts were swirling in my mind that I couldn’t even remember when I got ready.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Let’s go then. Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Guess I’ve to leave now.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari came to pick me up and together we left the house.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I noticed that she was carrying quite a large bag.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari, it looks heavy…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We were going to the pool, and guess the only things we needed were the swimwear and some personal belongings… but for some reason, she was carrying a big handbag.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, this is… Well, I made lunch.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Lunch?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I hope you’ll like it. Um… Did it bother you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“No-no, I like it. The meal you cook is so good that I want to have it every day.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yesterday the curry she prepared was delicious. She’s truly an exceptional cook.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">My thoughts were honest, but I guess I made a slight mistake…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-w-what did you just say… e-every day. It’s… I’m glad…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The last word I added was unnecessary. What I wanted to say was that her dishes were truly delicious, but it seems that she misunderstood.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“L-let’s leave then. Here, Akari, give me your bag.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“E-every day… Cooking for you everyday… Does this mean m-marriage…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">I can’t hear you. And for your information, siblings can’t get married…</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even though she said it’s a practice… We’re dating in a formal sense.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So for that reason, I was in an appropriate outfit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Umu”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When we were walking side by side, I realized once again how high her status was. It wouldn’t be a surprise if people around us were thinking that we were an odd couple.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That Yamamoto once told me that I wasn’t fit for her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I guess he wasn’t wrong.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Onii-chan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, nothing. It’s nothing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Oops, I didn’t know I was unintentionally looking at her this whole time. My bad.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um… you know, Onii-chan…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“How am I… I mean… what do you think about this?” She asked while playing with her bangs.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hm, she looked different, usually, her hair was straight down, but today it was tied with two knots by both sides. I wondered if it was pigtails or twintails. I did not know hairstyles, but it was a refreshing change from her usual looks.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You’re looking great and it suits you. Your usual hairstyle is also good, but I think you look cute in this new look.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Again I spilled out honestly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah, I s-see… fufu~”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She hid her face and muttered something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Hmm, From Akari’s POV, it must be, she’s happy “being praised by the person she likes.”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was surprised to see her cheerful expressions…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Over the past few days, I realized that Akari was becoming more expressive, with a relaxed tone and playfulness. Sadly, she’s only doing it in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When it comes to people other than me, Nanami for example, Akari keeps a respectful tone and never smiles. I guess it’s because she’s younger than her, but it’s the same for her classmates. She never deviates from the image of the “cool beauty” that all her self-proclaimed fans have.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The only exception is with me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She doesn’t use honorifics, she shows her happiness, anger, sadness, and sorrow, and she actively talks to me even if I don’t pay attention to her. I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I believe it’s her true self.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I remembered that once she wrote in her note that, “I’m not interested in anyone other than my Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then it means it was the truth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It took us an hour by train.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Today, we came to a place called “Underwater Park”, which was like a multi-complex facility. It was a great place for couples to go on a date, where they could enjoy not only the swimming pool, but also interact with aquatic animals, a vast flower garden, and even some attractions.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hmm, It was the perfect place for a couple’s date.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Hmm, I never even imagined that one day I’d come here with Akari.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“There’s still some time left, so let’s hang out till the afternoon then we’ll have lunch, and then after that the pool, okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ok, that’s fine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The main purpose of the trip was to swim, but it would be a shame to spend the whole day in the pool.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well then, let’s start from there…, hmm, Akari!?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I was talking about the date plan, looking at the map, Akari was fidgeting as if she wanted something from me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Ah, Okay, today is just a rehearsal for the date. So let’s have some fun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I remembered immediately what she was trying to appeal to. Yesterday, Nanami had shown a similar attitude, so I guess it was that.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I reached out my hand and she held it with a beautiful smile on her face, far better than her usual cool expression.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I want her to enjoy this date.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that, We walked slowly, trying to keep pace with her.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s so pretty…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After a while, we arrived at a large floral garden. The flowers have blossomed in a variety of colors, and they were all so stunning that it was impossible to decide which was the prettiest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, such a lovely sight…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was surprised because I never got the chance to look at so many flowers at once. Unfortunately, I didn’t know the names of the flowers that were planted here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was so refreshing to see their charm.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I sat down on a bench beside me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Onii-chan, sorry. I’ll be back in a minute.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ok. I’ll wait for you here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After saying that, Akari left by leaving her bag on the bench.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It would be rude to think about where she went.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sigh… It’s more like a date than a typical rehearsal… Well, if Akari’s having fun, that’s fine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Till now we were clasping hands. Though it was a practice, our hands were interlocked as if it was natural. I had never done this before even with Nanami, who I had been dating for a while.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Yesterday, I went on a date with a girl I pretended to be dating. And today, I had a date with my younger sister under the guise of a rehearsal…</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Guess, I’m in a very twisted relationship. Normal high school siblings don’t walk hand in hand. And I believe it’s impossible to practice for a date in the first place.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Up until now, I was pretending to be unaware of Akari’s feelings. But that was not the case anymore…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was going over the boundaries.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Because Akari was approaching me literally.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t play dumb forever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If Nanami didn’t like me then I would’ve been saved from this practice date. *</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Sigh* it’s no longer a rehearsal… but a real date. Well, Akari seems to be having fun, so be it.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But something was off.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This morning, I was wondering if I should continue my relationship with Nanami, who clearly expressed her love for me. And I couldn’t continue to be in a relationship like this with Akari.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Hmm, after this date is over…</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">At that time, a flower caught my attention.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was a bright orange flower. In front of it was a signboard that said, “Marigolds.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Marigolds, huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Its name sounded familiar. Probably it was a well-known flower.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Underneath it, something was written in small letters. It was too far away for me to read, but it seemed to say something about the meaning of flowers or something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Meaning of flowers… I can’t read it.’</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I thought about getting up for a look, but Akari came back while I was intrigued, so I decided not to.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Well, I should probably check it out later.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After the walk, it was time for lunch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Though it was around noon, we were moving so much that I felt hungry. And since we had to swim in the afternoon, we decided to eat our fill.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We opened our lunches on the bench. The lunch she prepared for me was visually stunning.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There were several dishes on skewers, such as fried chicken, sausage, omelet, to make it easy for me to pick up.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And when I opened another box, I found there was a sandwich tightly packed inside.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I immediately took a bite of the omelet.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, it’s tasty. Akari.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It had the sweet flavor that I love, and it was really good. Next, I tried the sandwich and fried chicken.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Yes, they are all delicious.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I didn’t know you were such an excellent cook, Akari.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ve been studying occasionally since I was in junior high school. Besides, some of the dishes in the home were made by me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, I didn’t know that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Well, I know.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Umm, Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Now that we’re on a date, I think we should do something like this.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Like this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes, say aah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari took the sandwich with her hand and brought it to my mouth… </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">wait, shouldn’t you use chopsticks for this?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… ah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, I couldn’t refuse to eat after being treated so well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Do you like it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yeah, it’s good…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I see…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But the truth was that I was nervous and couldn’t focus on its taste.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Anything for you Onii-chan…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I was chewing, Akari muttered something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Would you like to have my lunches for school too? I can make it for you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She shyly glanced at me while suggesting so.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even though she asked but her expressions were as if she wanted me to accept.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But,</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“The first semester will be over soon. I think I’ll ask you in the second semester.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t resist her pleading eyes, so I decided to postpone it.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“A lot of people are here…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After the meal, we came to the pool, which was our original purpose.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So I dressed up and came out early. It wasn’t even summer vacation yet this place was full of people as far as the eye could see.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was a large water pool that covers the entire site, slides, and even a small pool for children.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This place was more of a playground than to swim, that was expected.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It might be a little frustrating for those who wanted to swim, but it was just right for having fun.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Guess, I shouldn’t wander around too far since it was crowded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It would be best to meet up with Akari at the exit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then I put my luggage in a safe place and headed back to the changing room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey, where are you from?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You’re cute. Are you in high school?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… Oh, I had a feeling this would happen. I knew it!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I looked closely, Akari was approached by two men.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">They were asking a lot of questions while waiting for her to react, but Akari was ignoring them as usual.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In contrast to the men who were smiling so frivolously, Akari remained cool without a single smile on her face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">This is not the time to be looking at them like this. I have to help her.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Aka&mdash;!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry. I’m here with my boyfriend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Just as I was about to call her, she noticed me and told them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Boyfriend? Where?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When one of the boys asked, she came closer, and…</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m sorry, that’s just how it is.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She clung tightly to my arm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… I felt her soft skin through my arm because she was in a swimsuit. </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Wait, stop thinking about her body. She’s my sister. But why’s she behaving like this?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Let’s go? Onii… Yusuke.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That was the final blow.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Guess she couldn’t say “Onii-chan” after introducing me as her boyfriend.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But… It was too fresh an experience for me to be called by my first name… Combined with the feeling of her touch and warmth, my mind was blown away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When we were leaving, I heard the guys saying something like, “That is your boyfriend…?” but I didn’t even have time to worry about it.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry I was late… hm? What’s wrong?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">While hugging my arm, Akari glanced at me passionately.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">I’m sorry, but right now my mind is a complete mess.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was a surge of emotions overflowing in my heart that I was embarrassed just by looking at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nothing. I’m happy.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">For now, I just needed some time to cool down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So I went back to the place where I had left my luggage earlier and sat down for a moment. I wondered why I had to expend so much energy before swimming, but I decided not to think about it anymore.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">*Sigh*</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I took a deep breath and peeked at Akari who was organizing her stuff next to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Though it wasn’t a surprise, she was wearing the same swimsuit that we bought the other day.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The black color made her white skin stand out even more. I could understand why people were glancing at her, and why those guys came to her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“O-okay. Now let’s get ready to swim.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It would be bad of me to keep staring at her like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I supposed it was bad manners.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I stood up in a hurry for a few exercises to get ready for the swim.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Kya&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But then, I heard a girl’s voice and felt something hit my back.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I turned around in surprise, I found myself looking in the eyes of a beautiful lady. It seemed that we bumped into each other.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m s-sorry!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The girl apologized in panic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">There was a ball nearby. Perhaps, she was chasing after this ball…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry, are you hurt?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t help it with this crowd.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was more worried about whether she was fine or not.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Oh, I’m good.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Glad she’s okay.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“That’s a relief. Well then have fun&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“W-wait&mdash;, that’s so sweet of you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Just as I was about to hand over the ball and she called me again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What? Sweet, me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Because you’re the first one to worry about me… and I think that’s a good attitude.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Wasn’t that the most obvious thing to do?</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“If you’d like, we can play together with my friends.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">…Eh? Could it be…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Do you mean volleyball?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes! And if you like would you tell me your name?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This girl, despite her naive appearance, was a conversationalist.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I used to believe that only boys try these tricks.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hey.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As I was lost in thoughts, I heard a cold voice behind me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I turned around and found that Akari was staring daggers at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah! Okay, It’s fine… see you later.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She might’ve sensed everything in that instant. There was no sign of the aggressiveness she had shown earlier, and she quickly fled from the scene.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">All that remained was an awkward atmosphere with Akari.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“S-sorry!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Unable to endure such an atmosphere, I couldn’t help but apologize.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m not mad at you, you’re here on a date with me and you’re chatting with another girl like you’re having fun. If I didn’t show up, you would have accepted her offer. I don’t care about that at all because we’re siblings. There’s no reason for me to be angry, you know.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">… No-no, I don’t believe you. I can see that you’re angry.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was just a rehearsal, but her words pierced me like thorns as if she was my real girlfriend.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m really sorry. It has nothing to do with being siblings or anything like that. Today I’m on a date with you so I should be here for you first.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was a little shaken knowing how she felt. That’s why I apologized sincerely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“… Then I’ll forgive you if you do something for me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ll forgive you if you apply sunscreen on me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She mumbled something but I was unable to comprehend it.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m doing it…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I took the cream and with both hands rubbed it on Akari’s back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…nh”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I applied it all over her pure white skin. I felt like I was doing something strange because I could hear her moan. It wasn’t strange I was just applying sunscreen on her back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But one thing was for sure that… the girls’ skin is so smooth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was surprised at how delicate it was compared to my own body… </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Ahh! that’s not the point!</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">… These malicious thoughts were popping up in my mind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Nyaa…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">This time her moan was different from what I heard earlier.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But then my attention shifted to my hands. It didn’t even take me a second to realize that my hands were caressing her breasts this whole time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Whaaaaa! I’m sorry! I didn’t notice it at all!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I hurriedly took my hands away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It’s over…! I was thinking about all kinds of weird things and didn’t pay any attention to where I was touching…!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Then I peeked at Akari, her face was red with embarrassment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Argh… I messed up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um… I’ve applied the sunscreen on your back.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I closed the cap and put the cream beside her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’ll buy something to drink.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After that, I decided to kill time until things cooled down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Something like a date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I heard Akari’s suggestion, I remembered once again that the purpose of today was to practice for a date.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">However, I feel like we’ve already done a few things like holding hands, feeding each other, etc…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In Akari’s opinion, we had yet to complete the most important event of a date.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“It’s fine with me. What should we do then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I’ve never been in a situation where I’ve to date a girl, or even alone with her in a pool. So there’s no way I know what she expects me to do in a situation like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">So for now I’ll do whatever she wants me to do.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Let’s see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She muttered something while searching through her bag.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">What she pulled out was a… Smartphone?</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“We didn’t come to the pool before, but now that we’re here… why don’t we take some pictures.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Pictures… I see!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She was right.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Okay, let’s ask someone to click some pictures… Ehm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I scanned the surroundings to find someone who might be willing to take our picture.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And then.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">” … We don’t have to ask someone to take our photos. Just use your in-camera, like this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And then she pushed herself close to me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ohh, A-akari, we are… too close…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“We won’t be in the same photo unless I do so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">No, I knew what she meant, but…!</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Unlike the time when she clung to my arm, this time our faces were incredibly close.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Her long hair occasionally tickled my cheek. We were so close that if I turned around, our lips would touch each other.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“S-so, I’m going to take a picture…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But it seemed that I wasn’t the only one who was upset.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I had no choice but to stick with her. She wasn’t focused at all. I knew that because her hand that held the smartphone was shaking.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah, Akari. Let me take it.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I took the phone from her and adjusted the angle.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Here, well then…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was the first time for me to take a picture with her in such proximity, so I was nervous to a certain extent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But for some reason, at that moment…</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/MfWBzNZ/210-1.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm… let’s see. How’s it?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We were both smiling as if it was natural, and it was similar to the picture when we were kids.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Too cute…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As we were checking the photo, Akari muttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I couldn’t hear what she said, but she seemed to be happy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But one thing that bothers me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">That both of us were in swimsuits. </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Please don’t frame this picture.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The next thing I noticed that the weather was getting colder.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Onii-chan, should we go home now?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari asked me while sipping the cold drink I bought earlier.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was around 4 o’clock and the crowd that was around us had become quite sparse.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Indeed, it was about time for us to leave.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Sorry, Akari. But there is somewhere I want to go.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Where do you want to go?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Ah, I wanted to go back to the flower garden we saw at lunch.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m fine with that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Well, let’s get changed.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">With that, I grabbed my luggage and headed for the changing room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">After changing, I met up with her at the exit and walked for ten minutes. We arrived at the bench where we took a break for lunch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“.. It’s so beautiful.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The sunset in the floral garden was as beautiful as a work of art.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I had a lot of fun today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We sat down on a bench side by side and Akari began to share her thoughts.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“We had lunch, swimming, and relaxed in this beautiful flower garden together… I’ve kept my distance from you all this time, so I guess you were surprised that we’re spending time like this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Um, Onii-chan. Would you help me with another date as well?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“This time it was the pool, so next for the time…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Akari&mdash;&mdash; I need to talk to you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It was the first time I opened my mouth since I came here, though I felt like I was interrupting the conversation.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“About what?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Yes. It’s important.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The truth was, I never intended to tell her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">We grew up without knowing anything about each other. “</span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">All that was left in my mind was an old memory.” Kind of.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I thought I’d just keep it to myself and reminisce.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I was hoping that one day Akari’s feelings for me would fade away and she would tell me, “I used to love you Onii-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">But now that Nanami has confessed her feelings to me, I have to face her sincerely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">It couldn’t be helped.</span></p>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Even so, I just couldn’t leave Akari all alone.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“You know, I knew everything… all about you, Akari.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">In the third year of junior high school, I happened to find an “Onii-chan Notebook” in Akari’s room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I found out that there were surveillance cameras and microphones installed in my room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">When I wasn’t around, she secretly went through my personal belongings.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She pretended to be uninterested, but sometimes she followed me at school.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And that she was planning to… lock me up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“The reason I spoke to you in the first place was that I was aware of your plans. I asked Nanami for help by telling a lie, that an acquaintance wants to be friends with you. But the truth was I wanted to stop your plan, so I decided to start by getting close to you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">The smile that was beaming on her face fade away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“And then I noticed that you began to talk with me again. So I thought if I kept this up, one day you would give up on your plan and no one would get hurt. That’s what I thought, and I was going to keep it to myself for a long time. But then I thought about… Nanami and I realized that I couldn’t keep doing that forever.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m not dating Nanami. But she indeed confessed to me, and now we are… pretending to be together, or something like that. She asked me to take a look at her outside the frame of a childhood friend. That’s why I want to do my best to respond to Nanami’s feelings. Even if I end up rejecting Nanami, I want to give her a sincere reply. That’s how I feel.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">And.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m glad that you like me, you know. If you were annoying I think I would have said so back then in junior high school. But you know, the thing is that we are siblings. And this fact…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“&mdash;It’s not n-normal, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Akari, who was down all this time, mumbled quietly. </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Say it clearly…</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“I’m going home first…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She hurriedly ran away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">She seemed to understand what I was trying to say.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I thought she also knew that I wouldn’t be able to give her a proper answer.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">If I continued to do things half-heartedly, Nanami would be hurt. I thought that’s why I told everything to Akari, but…</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">I unconditionally hurt her while worrying about Nanami.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“Hmm? That girl… she forgot her bag.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">No matter how delicious food she cooks.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">No matter how cute she is.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Even if my heart beats for Akari…</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">She’ll be my sister in the end.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Even if I don’t go out with Nanami, I still won’t be able to return her feelings.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Even after knowing all this, I wonder why my heart is hurting so much after I saw her crying as she leaves.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“…Ahh”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">As soon as she walked away, I saw the marigold flower I had seen at lunch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I remembered that I was going to look up the meaning of flowers later.</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">I approached the signboard where the name and meaning were written… </span><i class="calibre7"><span class="calibre9">Let’s see.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">“The meaning of marigolds is… jealousy, sorrow, and despair.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre9">Strangely enough, it seemed to be perfect for us right now, and I couldn’t help but chuckle.</span></p>
