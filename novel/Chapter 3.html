<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Get a juicy knowledge with cheat! ~Money Earning Edition~</h3>


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going&#8221;</p>
<p>As I said when i laeving home.<br />
My house is in the countryside.<br />
Behind my house is a mountain.<br />
And except for the mountain, my house is surrounded by rice field, it is around 500 meters away to the neighbour house wich is Corfelia&#8217;s. [TN:neighbour? 500 m away, whoaa&#8230;]
<p>So &#8230; I can walk around to some extent alone when I was four years old.<br />
My household is poor. Well, it&#8217;s just an villager family.<br />
And now, I am playing alone, and i supposed to picking wild vegetables at the side of mountain.<br />
I mean, speaking about a genius boy playing in the mountain, that&#8217;s where i am. [TN:bruh&#8230;]
<p>Whatever it is called, as natural matter to eat wild vegetables, and I also bring back some medicinal herbs that sell by value with quite high probability.<br />
That&#8217;s why my parents have decided to discretion in a certain degree for me who is walking down from mountain early in the morning and evening. [TN: &#8230;. im not sure in this line, does he mean he is goes to mountain 2 times in a day?]
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to do something so troublesome such as picking wild vegetables or taking medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>Wild Vegetables, Medicinal Herbs, and sometimes Rabbit Meats.<br />
Sometimes I taking all of those home&#8230;.. Sometimes I bought those in the town.<br />
That why I decided to go to mountain and asking myself &#8220;What were you doing at the mountain?&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; I tought &#8220;I went outside the village and earn some money&#8221;</p>
<p>How does a mere 4 years old child earn money? or, what are you earning money for?</p>
<p>As for How to earn, its simple story with my MP and skills.<br />
And, it is a simple answer to what i am earning for.</p>
<p>-I decided to become stronger.</p>
<p>Then, on the rice field that leads the way to where the mountain is, I encountered the future &#8216;Hero&#8217;- Cordelia.</p>
<p>One piece on smooth crimson hair like silk and blue eyes.<br />
A Beauty that &#8216;common sense&#8217; can only expressed as an angel, exactly with that white smooth skin.<br />
To say that, she is not too easy to imagine that her future would grow so beautifully. But I know that she will grow up into a really ridiculous beauty.</p>
<p>As I thought that, she running towards me while her cheeks inflating (pouting).</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to~ go to the mountain with Lute~&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry Cordelia. Where I go to is not a mountain but a city.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m not going to bring Cordelia with me&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugugu&#8230;.gugu&#8230;.&#8221; (while pouting) [TN: so cute&#8230;.]
<p>Cordelia is in the edge of want to cry while watching me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lute is&#8230;. won&#8217;t play with me&#8230; Why? Why? I am lonely&#8230;&#8221; [TN: can i hug her?&#8230; dont ever call police okay?]
<p>If i want to say everyting, I just can say that is your fault.</p>
<p>Even though she hasn&#8217;t received a oracle. A proof that someone is certified as &#8216;Hero&#8217;, someone who have a status that growing at the speed of light -because the gap of growing is like an different dimension.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the &#8216;present&#8217; me&#8230;.. have to make a choice.</p>
<p>Then *Pon (SFX) and i pat her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will play with you next time so&#8230;. I&#8217;m sorry&#8221;</p>
<p>A big grain of tears flowed on her cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;idiot&#8230; Lute is &#8230;. Lute is&#8230;. Idioo&#8212;&#8211;t!&#8221; [TN: aa~ Lute is guilty, to make a Cute child like her cry]
<p>Cordelia going home and running off shouted with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230;.I won&#8217;t listen to you anymore!&#8221;</p>
<p>That quite a pain i thought&#8230; I caught sight of Cordelia who is running off in a crowd.<br />
And she got scolded on the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..Uwaaa~! *hiks..u&#8230;uu~ *hiks I&#8230;idiot! Lu~te is idiot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whoaa&#8230;. what a pain&#8230;.<br />
Then, she began walking to the entrance of my house.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.Now&#8221;</p>
<p>I entered the mountain with the slight of power from my skill.</p>
<p>Then I run through the forest at the speed of wind.<br />
Around 100 meter run with only 14 second, for young children that throught out the forest at ultra high speed.</p>
<p>What I use is physical ability strengthening : Level 4.</p>
<p>The theory of physical strengthening is very simple.<br />
It is said to reinforce muscle cells with magical power to produce force that exceeding the limit of potential ability.</p>
<p>So, there is no one who can use this at my age.<br />
Well, there is no doubt that it is quite rare, but this skill is a skill that is considered essential in close battle.<br />
If you are a son of a nobility from a professional soldier who is charged with Iroha martial arts, probably you can use it around the same age as me.</p>
<p>By the way, it was 7 years old that Cordelia&#8217;s oracle was received and at the age of 6 and she learned this skill &#8230;&#8230; Well, whatever.</p>
<p>In other words, this skill is quite hard to learn and i train it up to Level 4.</p>
<p>And&#8230;. Thanks to this skill I can instaneously draw unexpected power output, obviously there is need a consideration for using this skill.</p>
<p>Because it reinforces the muscles with magical power, it inevitably uses MP.<br />
And if the user MP is dried out, he is done for.<br />
That&#8217;s why, normally this skill is used when you are really need a boost for physical ability, temporary.<br />
For example, when you are in battle, or like carrying a hufe baggage.</p>
<p>However, even though my MP capacity is exceeds that the adult have,&#8230;.. Seriously, what a cheat i am.</p>
<p>That skill can be strengthened throughout the day [TN: not sure in this line 　それこそ一日中でも強化していられる。]
Actually, by just adding or subtracting power adjustments, I constantly strengthening that skill. (adjusting his mana output, maybe)</p>
<p>Recently, it&#8217;s so difficult to exhausting my MP, and i have to deplete my MP like this right now. (He mean draining his MP on the go)<br />
Honestly, what i did is too much in many mays [TN: he reflecting himself, at least]
<p>Like &#8230; go through the mountains and enter the forested land at the flatland.<br />
I run and keep running through the forest for 30 minutes.<br />
Finally I reached the roadside town on the higway.</p>
<p>And at the end of the road &#8211; While at the usual place- nobody is around, I put a goza (kind of mat) like usual and set a price list.<br />
Then, a traveler took off his shoes in less than a few minutes and sat down on the goza.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey young&#8217;un&#8230;.. are you under supervision within the Curch? Is it good&#8230;. is it good with just 2 copper coins?&#8221;</p>
<p>it&#8217;s worth around 2000 yen in japan.<br />
When i nodded, the traveler showed me the soles of his feet to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blister is wounded when walking&#8230;. Afterward it&#8217;s purely fatigue accumulating on the feet&#8221;</p>
<p>After I said that words, I applied the healing magic to the traveler&#8217;s feet.<br />
Then that blister wound is healed while the patient was watching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unn&#8230;(yes), thank you&#8221;</p>
<p>Satisfied with the treatment, he stood up and give the money to me.</p>
<p>What I did there is an instant healing magic.<br />
Usually this lodging cities (Port town) is the rest area for peddler or traveler.<br />
The traffic on this higway is quite crowded, my work wont interrupted, and customers will appear constantly.<br />
Espectially, I&#8217;m doing it at a price that less than half of usual price, so it&#8217;s quite pulling some customers.</p>
<p>Even though my MP extension is in fever time continues, it is so boring with my skyhigh MP capacity until it runs out.<br />
And if someone is at my age, that is not uncommon (not rare) to be able to handle rudimentary the recovery magic if you are a son of professional magician.</p>
<p>Well~, there are no one who can do infinite recovery magic like me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why i&#8217;m traveling around the town&#8217;s roadside of the higway with a tremendous number of treatments that not stand out too much, and I planning to spend on consumption my MP and small earnings.</p>
<p>By the way, money that was I earning in the past six month is around 100 million Japanese yen that I stored behind the mountain.<br />
Even with this alone you already know how ridiculously my MP is. That is because the order of recovery magic that determined with supply and demand. [TN: not sure in this line]
<p>Well, this is still so far from the target amount.<br />
It&#8217;s not like I am in a hurry, it&#8217;s just like I want to expanding my MP . [TN: how greedy human creature are&#8230;.]
<p>And then.<br />
Its alredy evening while I still around the post town.</p>
<p>While I looking at the status plate, it seems my strengthening physical ability became 5 because i was running around.<br />
*Uuush, when i made a guts pose, I Packing up my goza and went home.</p>
<p>Opposide to where the road i came from, I entered from the large forest and then exited to backyard.<br />
I dug the ground and pick up the vase from there and threw the money that I earned today into there.<br />
So&#8230;. I passing throught the mountain and went out to rice field.</p>
<p>And I encountered Cordelia [TN: The wild cute girl appeared&#8230;. sorry i can&#8217;t hold myself at that line from P*kemon]
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is starring at me with her puffed cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Cordelia?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; [TN: the best line ever!]
<p>She still silent and keep staring at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s wrong, Cordelia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she turn to sideways with a sound effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;won&#8217;t&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you, is your voice that small?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I won&#8217;t talk to you anymore&#8230;. I have been here since morning&#8221;</p>
<p>Uwaa&#8230; What a pain&#8230;.</p>
<p>I picking up something at my pocket and took out the parcel.<br />
And approaching Cordelia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, It&#8217;s a souvenir for you&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.eeh~?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cordelia open up the wrapped parcel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a whote bread sandwich, bacon with lettuce and cheese are sandwiched&#8230; that you like, you want it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bread that is served as meal in poor farmers household is called black bread.<br />
It&#8217;s texture very hard and i can&#8217;t eat as is it.<br />
Soak it in soup, and it&#8217;s like finally it can be eaten, that was totally different from the bread that i know before.<br />
Bread that you can eat in Japan is a luxury item called white bread in here. (it&#8217;s not only japan geeez)</p>
<p>there is no chance to eat it (white bread) without a little celebration, and also white bread is Cordelia&#8217;s favorite.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>After a brief mute, Cordelia smiled widely.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is so troublesome, so please just eat it right now&#8221;</p>
<p>After i said that, Cordelia nodded like a clown and began picking up the sandwich with tremendous momentum (hasty movement).<br />
Actually, it is very weird to say that &#8216;I got this food from Lute&#8217; and bring it home.</p>
<p>My parents still think me as an ordinary kid. [TN: well, you&#8217;re a naughty one you know]
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..hnn&#8221;</p>
<p>Cordelia who finished her meal lending her right hand towards me.<br />
This is a thing that called &#8216;connecting/holding hands&#8217;.</p>
<p>While thinking that is so troublesome, I took her hand, and we started walking towards our home. [TN: Tch&#8230;..]
<p>&#8220;Ne~ ne~ Lu~te?&#8221; (Ne~ ne same as &#8216;Hey hey&#8217; if you didn&#8217;t know that)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today~, my mother is~&#8221; &lt;Cordelia&gt;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see&#8230;&#8221; &lt;Lute&gt;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, what?&#8221; &lt;Cordelia&gt;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you won&#8217;t talk to me for the rest of your life, right?&#8221; &lt;Lute&gt;</p>
<p>To my words, Cordelia answered with a big smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what i mean?&#8221; &lt;Cordelia&gt;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;hn?&#8221; &lt;Lute&gt;</p>
<p>&#8220;I take what i said back~&#8221;</p>
<p>Wry smile appeared at my face towards her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah~ yeah~ is that so~?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then we joined hands and we go home to each of our house.</p>
<p>Two years has passed when I still continuing such a life&#8230; Finally the amount of target was reached.<br />
My enhancement program proceed to the next stage.</p>
