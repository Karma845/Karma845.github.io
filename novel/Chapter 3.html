<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; How to take Revenge on Sasha the Elf?</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">--Some
time back.</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
few days after I finished taking revenge on Garou the Beastman, we gathered in
the office that we built by remodeling Naraku.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As I
am sitting on my seat, facing my LV Four-Nine (9999) comrades. They are
standing in front of me. Mei, the seeker maid with black hair with a ponytail
and maid outfit. Aoyuki, the genius monster tamer who is short and wearing a cat
ears hoodie. Elly, the forbidden witch in gothic lolita clothes with blond hair
tied in two, and Nazuna, the true vampire knight with red eyes, silver hair,
and wearing armor.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Now
that I've taken revenge on Garou, the next step is to gather information.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
had shown off our strength to Garou, but it would be foolish to suddenly start
a war against the whole world without thinking.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
first thing I need to do is to gather information on how much strength my
opponent has.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course, I won't forget to take revenge. But if we only focus on taking revenge
on the remaining four without gathering information, in the worst-case
scenario, we may lose without completing anything. We have to gather
information about the "Master", why they want to kill me, and who
destroyed my hometown." </span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly,
with her beautiful blonde hair tied in two, wearing a witch's hat and a black
gothic Lolita outfit, nodded her head at my statement.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
is a SUR, "Elly the Forbidden Witch, Level 9999.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
is the second-in-command who has mastered all sorts of magic and spirit arts.
She is in charge of directing and planning operations for everyone.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
am really sorry. If I had finished adjusting the Dungeon Core a little earlier,
we might have been able to save God Raito's hometown.......</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
not your fault, Elly. Naraku is so large that it takes a long time to conquer,
and the transfer card is useless at first....... Because there were too many
unexpected things."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I was still in Race Union, I thought we have reached "the middle level of
Naraku". But actually, that was still just the upper level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
lowest level in the dungeon is the 100th floor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
place that I have mistaken as the middle level is the 10th floor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Besides,
even after conquering Naraku, it is still impossible to move using the transfer
card.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
cause is the Dungeon Core.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
what is the "Dungeon Core"?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
explain it, we must first talk about the myth of the creation of this world.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
first, the world has nothing; it was only a muddy black swirl.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
the Goddess shone her light on it, continents were formed, and six races were
born.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
human race, the beastmen race, the dragon race, the elf race, the dwarf race,
and the demon race.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
remains of the black swirl then became the Evil God..</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Evil God loved the Goddess and wanted to make her his own, but the earth was
blocking him, and he could not come out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So
he spits out the monsters he created with his own body into the earth through
the crack also known as the dark hole (generally considered a metaphor for a
dungeon).</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
wants to increase the monster's numbers and capture the Goddess.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
races created from the Goddess's light fight the monsters to protect her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
monsters try to eliminate all the races that get in their way: the beast race,
dragon race, elf race, dwarf race, and demon race.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
battle has been going on for a long time.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">These
are the myth of the creation of this world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Monsters
get stronger at night because the power of the evil gods at the underground is
stronger.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
is said that the further underground you go, the stronger the monsters become
because they are closer to the power of the Evil God.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I've
been thinking about turning "Naraku" into our base for quite some
time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
called </span><span class="calibre13">the world's largest, hardest, and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku".</span><span class="calibre13"> Therefore it's extremely
difficult to reach the deepest part.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the contrary, it is not difficult for us to go back and forth between the
surface world and the underground by using the power of the "SSR,
Transfer" card from the "Infinity Gacha".</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
there are some problems with implementing my plan.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">First
of all, I didn't understand what a "dungeon core" really is.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Generally
speaking, a dungeon core is a mass of evil god's power or a living part of it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
the dungeon core is destroyed, the dungeon will stop functioning. It is also
believed that whoever destroys it will gain power and weaken the power of the
evil god.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">After
we all gathered our strength and conquered the abyss, Elly, the forbidden witch
who knows the most about magic among us, investigated the dungeon core of
Naraku. Still, it was not something we could understand.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">According
to Elly, dungeon cores somehow shape dungeons by absorbing the planet's energy
and magical power. It pulls out the minerals and materials to create treasure
chests and items, even spawn demons, create traps, and create a wide variety of
environments. It's creating a miniature world. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
even Elly herself didn't understand why the dungeon core can do that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
she couldn't understand it, then no one under my command can.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Eventually,
thanks to Elly's efforts, we managed to maintain the dungeon at a minimum, somehow
removed the transfer blockage and succeeded in turning the dungeon into a
fortress.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the process, it stopped producing items and monsters, therefore I used my
"Infinite Gacha" gift to replace that features.</span></p>





<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Finally,
about six months ago, I can go outside and check on my hometown. But my
hometown had been destroyed.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
not sure if it was the monsters or the bandits that destroyed my village. Maybe
they are the people who tried to kill me when they found out I am not the
"Master". Maybe they destroyed my hometown using demons and
bandits."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Huh!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
and the others standing in front of me turned pale.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
atmosphere in the office creaks and squeaks as if it's making a physical sound.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
office's atmosphere creaks as if it were physically making a noise because of
my murderous intention.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Phew.
......</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
calmed myself down.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
if I let my anger take control, we still can't identify the culprit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
now, we still have to gather information.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Along with gathering information, I'm also thinking about my next target. My
next target for revenge is Sasha, the elf.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
former member of the Race Union, Sasha the Elf.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
one who deceived, mocked, and tried to kill me with her own hands.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other girls except Mei changed their eyes at this statement, then they speak up.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Raito-sama!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">If
you want to catch that betrayer elf as you did with Garou, please leave it to
me!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
I'll take care of it!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nya!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">I
feel happy when I saw their motivation, but I shook my head.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
glad you feel that way, but I'm not going to do what I did with Garou. In his
case, it was partly revenge, but we used Mei as bait because I want to confirm
our strength. He is from Beastmen nation with the least power, and he is the
easiest of the five to catch."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Based
on Garou and his men's battle and reaction, we were able to confirm our power.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
felt that even if we start a war against the world, our strength would be
enough to overcome them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
that doesn't mean we're stupid enough to fight the world without gathering
information.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Unlike
what we did with Garou, it would be difficult to bring Sasha to Naraku.
Besides, it would be boring to take revenge the same way, am I right? She needs
to experience the same despair as I did."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
same despair as Master Raito?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
tilted her head slightly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
long black ponytail sways like a tail.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
answer her question with an angelic smile.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"According
to my men who are gathering information on the surface world, Sasha is about to
marry his fiancée. A vice-commander who is related to the royal family. She's
at the height of her happiness, and as a former party member, I think I need to
take my revenge on her in a big way."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I put
a big smile at the thought of revenge on Sasha.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
told Mei and the others about the revenge plan I had for Sasha.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
listening to the whole thing, Elly is the first to raise her hands.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
a great idea!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">As expected of God Raito! But if you
leave it to me, I can promise you a result better to what God Raito
wants."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Heee,......let
me hear it!</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Then..."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
modified my plan that she had just heard and presented me with a new revenge
plan. Her plan's content follows my revenge idea, but it's better than what I
wanted and has more advantages.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
finished her explanation.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
haven't worked out the details yet, but I think that is the general plan. What
do you think, Raito-sama?</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Excellent!
It's excellent! As expected from Elly! Your idea is better than mine!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
it's only possible because it was originally your idea."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I praise her, Erie bows as if she felt thankful to me.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"To
carry out this plan, we will need God Raito's power, 'Infinite Gacha' and a lot
of manpower. I'm sorry to be so rude, but may I ask for your help, Raito-sama?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course. You may use any supplies, manpower, information, or anything else you
need for this plan without restriction. You got my permission."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you very much."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Elly received my permission, she bowed deeply again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
she looked up, she gave Mei a triumphant look.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
know that Elly sees Mei as a rival, so I pretend not to notice and let it
slide.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
didn't say anything.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
also noticed that and only let out a whispered "Nya~".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
only one who didn't notice Elly's attitude is Nazuna.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
this plan works, I might even get a part in it!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I'm
on fire!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Elly! Please, quickly prepare
everything!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know, Shorty! You don't need to tell me that. I'll prepare everything for the Raito-sama
as soon as possible!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
atmosphere was about to get worse, but Nazuna's attitude changed the mood.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
may not think a lot of things, but she's a very important mood-maker. I
reminded myself about that fact.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I clear
my throat lightly and ask for everyone's attention.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Until
the preparations are complete, I'm going to start to the plan to gather
information, the Adventurer Plan. Elly, you'll do your best to work on Sasha's
revenge plan. If you need any help, or if a problem arises, feel free to let me
know. Because that's more important."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Certainly."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Master
Raito, if you are going to register as an adventurer in the guild again, I
would like to join your side."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I finished my instructions to Elly, Mei immediately offers herself to accompany
me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
inspired the other two to speak up as well.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nya!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
stronger than Mei and Aoki! So please, master! Please choose me as your
partner!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
happy with your feeling. But Elly will be busy with the mission. Mei, please
take care of the dungeon. I've captured Garou and killed his men, so there will
be a troop coming to search for them. We don't want to draw attention to Naraku
yet, so half of the searchers should be killed and half sent home."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Understood.
I'll use my maid way and do my best to fulfill Raito-sama wishes."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
this explanation, Mei understood what she needs to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
is necessary to brutally kill half of Garou's search party and send back the
other half in pain. Then they would spread the word like a canary that </span><span class="calibre13">the world's largest, hardest, and
most punitive dungeon, "Naraku"</span><span class="calibre13">, is still very dangerous.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki,
please continue to investigate the virgin forest around Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If there
are people or monsters in there, it would be troublesome for us.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nya~"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
shook her cat ear hoodie and accepted my command.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nazuna
is--"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
looks at me with big shining eyes, 'What kind of work will I be entrusted with?</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
is the strongest in close-range combat. If equipped with the highest magic item
that prevents magical attacks, she is the strongest among us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
she is too strong to be taken along as an adventurer and not suitable for
situations that require flexibility.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As a
mood maker in the dungeon, she is perfect. But there are certain things that
people are not suited for.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nazuna
is ......, and I want you to protect the dungeon while I'm gone. I think no one
can reach the deepest part of Naraku, but it's always good to be careful just
in case.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
sir! I'll leave it to me, master!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I'll
protect everyone!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
answers my instructions vigorously.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">My
adventuring companion is a "UR, Level 5000 Golden Knight Gold" as my
shield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If I
want to make a name for myself in this world, the fastest way is to explore the
dungeons.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">So, the
best option is to take along a UR, level 5000 Assassin Blade Nemumu, who is
skilled at spying, disarming traps, and detecting enemies.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
this way, the next plan has been decided.</span></p></div>
