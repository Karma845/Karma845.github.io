<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 3 &#8211; Mistakes All Around</h1><div class="text-left">
				<p class="calibre3">One day. I went to a movie theater near the station closest to my home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of course, it was to watch a Hollywood movie that Kiritani-sensei gave me a ticket for.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I didn’t tell Dr. Kiritani, but I basically only watch Japanese movies…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t have any particular reason, but I’ve only seen foreign films once or twice in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was also because Ruri and Touya invited me… Why was that coming up now?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Anyway, I was not familiar with foreign movies. I wondered if I could really like myself as he said by watching this Hollywood movie recommended by Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With some apprehension, I bought popcorn and a drink at a store in the theater.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After that, I showed my ticket to the receptionist and moved to the place where the Hollywood movie I wanted to see would be shown.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Middle of the middle row, the best seat in the house?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself and sat down anyway. There were only a few minutes left until the screening.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the way, the title of this Hollywood movie was “Freedom.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The main character was Marie, a girl who has had no freedom at all since she was a child, having been educated by her parents, a lawyer father, and a doctor mother.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even when she reached high school, she was forced to take various lessons, attend cram school, and couldn’t even go out with her friends.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the midst of these days, Marie meets Iris, a backpacker woman who was traveling around the world at her leisure. Through this encounter, Marie who, until now, had only done as her parents told her, gradually changed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the content of “Freedom.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…There is a Japanese person in this?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was looking at the pamphlet and saw a Japanese name in the cast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Moreover, she played the role of the backpacker woman.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her name is… Nanase Rena? I’m not an expert on actresses, but I’ve never heard of her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Whoa, it’s about to start.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The preview video before the screening was over, and the buzzer sounded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And finally, “Freedom” began.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the beginning of the film, the main character, Marie, was angry with her parents. She got a high score on the exam, but they scolded her because she didn’t get a perfect score. …What terrible parents.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then the story progressed to the scene where Marie and Iris meet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On her way home from cram school, Marie found Iris lying on the side of the road, hungry, and because of her kind-hearted nature, she couldn’t leave her alone and went into a nearby fast food restaurant with her to buy her a hamburger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the first fast food restaurant for Marie, who was not even allowed to hang out with her friends after school. Then Iris, a backpacker, began to talk to Marie about her trip in return for the hamburger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Marie, have you ever heard of the Great Barrier Reef?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know what it is. It’s very famous.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At a fast food restaurant. When Iris asked, Marie answered as if it was a matter of course.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, have you ever actually seen it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That… I’ve never seen it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hearing Marie’s words, Iris suddenly squeezed her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know what!? That ocean is amazing! It’s like there are countless jewels shining right before my eyes!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Iris &mdash; no, Nanase-san, who played Iris, had a twinkle in her eye like a child.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Is this person really acting?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The more I suspected that, the more Nanase-san looked like she was having fun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Later on in the story, as Iris told various stories from different countries, Marie began to be attracted to her, as she was living the exact opposite of what Iris was now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since then, Marie began to listen to Iris’ travel stories every day after cram school and lessons so that her parents would not find out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Little by little, Marie began to think that she wanted to live like Iris&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mom, Dad, I want to be a singer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Finally, she revealed her secret dream to her parents.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Naturally, her parents were furious. They became even more strict with Marie.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then one day. Marie met Iris for the first time in a long time on her way home from cram school. Since she told her parents about her dream, Marie had been under a strict curfew and had no time to talk to Iris.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marie was worried about the curfew and tried to leave, but Iris, who was worried about her, stopped her and they decided to talk.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marie then revealed that she had told her parents about her dream of becoming a singer, and when she spoke passionately about how she had longed to be a singer since she was a little girl.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“That’s awesome!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Iris gave her best smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Again. It was supposed to be an act, but I got the feeling that Nanase-san, who played Iris, was really happy from the bottom of her heart.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“A singer. Yes! I think that’s great!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Y-You think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes! I can fully understand Marie’s feelings… but you have to tell your parents about it, not me!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At Iris’s words, Marie turned her face down.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I can’t. Because my mom and dad are against it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marie looked worried.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Iris gently took both of her hands in hers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’ll be fine. I know you’ve been through a lot, but your parents love you. They just love you a little too much…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Really?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Marie asked, Iris nodded her head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am sure they will understand if you do your best to tell them how you feel.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was speaking calmly and reassuringly. …But there was a strange confidence to her words, and they were filled with enough power to move someone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I honestly don’t know much about acting…, but Nanase had a mysterious charm that naturally attracted someone to her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And my heart was trembling with the charm of it all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Later, encouraged by Iris, Marie tried once again to persuade her parents by telling them with all her might about her desire to become a singer, and they decided to allow her to pursue her dream, if she was that determined.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, about five years later.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marie, having fulfilled her dream, invited her parents to a live concert and performed her debut song in front of them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus, “Freedom” ended with a happy ending.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“That was only normally interesting.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the way home from the movie theater. I muttered to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hadn’t seen a movie in a while, but I couldn’t help but think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…But how can I like myself from watching this movie?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said that I might be able to like myself after watching the movie.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…I didn’t see that essence in it. The story was a good story about Marie fulfilling her dream, but it didn’t seem to have anything to do with liking yourself…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I wonder who that Nanase-san is, come to think of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even though she wasn’t the main character, that person’s performance caught my attention in a strange way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I don’t know how to say it… it’s acting, but it’s not acting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She really got into the role.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And she seemed to be having a lot of fun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Partly because it was such a role, but I think Nanase herself was probably having a good time while she was acting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Well, it was totally possible that I was wrong about all of that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think there was a page in the pamphlet introducing the cast of this movie…” </p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly I remembered and flipped through the pages of the pamphlet… Found it!</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the introduction page of the cast, there was of course a mention of Nanase.</p>
<p class="calibre3">An up-and-coming Hollywood actress. This movie, “Freedom,” was her debut film, and she seemed to be one of the hottest Hollywood actresses in the industry this year.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“She is amazing…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There must be only a few Japanese actresses in Hollywood, which was great enough, but she was an actress who was the focus of attention around the world…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh… Did she go to the same high school that I did?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The introduction page also listed the high school Nanase went to, and she was from Seiran High School, which I had never attended after entering. I wondered if such an amazing person was at the high school I entered…..</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There was an interview over here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The page I dropped my eyes on was about an interview with Nanase.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was curious and read it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">According to the interview, Nanase-san had been studying at a theater company since she was a middle school student, aiming to become a Hollywood actress. After graduating from high school, she went to the U.S. by herself and went through a lot of auditions, even though she could not speak English properly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So at first, every time she auditioned, she was made fun of.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“She went through a lot…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself as I read Nanase’s interview page.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But at the same time, I admired her courage. If it were me, it would be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nanase-san kept auditioning, and after about the fiftieth time, she caught the eye of the president of an office. He said he had never seen such an idiot before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After that, she was scouted by the office owned by the president, and she was thoroughly instructed in both English and acting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She was given harsh instruction at times, but Nanase never gave up and continued to work hard, growing beyond what she had achieved immediately after coming to the United States and becoming the Hollywood actress of her dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Dreams, huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had a dream of being a professional soccer player too, I recall.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Well, I lost my recommendation for a strong school, and it was too late for anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I continued to read the interview page, and the interviewer asked the following question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How was Nanase-san able to become a Hollywood actress herself?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was indeed curious. I wonder what Nanase herself thought made her dream come true.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I immediately looked at her reply.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Because I was living my life as my true self!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">There, along with a picture of Nanase-san’s smiling face, were written such words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Her words continue.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ever since I decided I wanted to be a Hollywood actress, I have lived my life as I am, without lying to myself at any time! I have lived my life the way I wanted to live it, not caring if people around me made a fuss!'”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even when things were painful, even when things were hard, she pushed forward on the path she thought she should take.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She never bent on that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If I hadn’t lived like that, I wouldn’t have become a Hollywood actress!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nanase answered in a way that sounded like it had come true before she knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She must have been living up to her dream.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She concluded the interview as follows.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Living life as you are is definitely the most enjoyable of any life!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">After reading the interview, I slowly closed the brochure.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Can I just be myself and not lie to myself…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nanase-san had said so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I see. That was why her acting could attract someone so much.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was because she was just being herself when she acts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…Then I’m going to think about what I was doing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was I really living my life without lying to myself?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was I living my life as myself?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I don’t think so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I played games every day, and when I was not playing games, I just sat around and did nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I like games, but I don’t like them enough to devote my life to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So what do I want to do?</p>
<p class="calibre3">What do I really want to be?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought about it for a while and came up with an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Am I sure…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I found myself questioning the conclusion I’ve reached.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Because I feel like it was not very acceptable…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei will come to my house in three days…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The feeling that I need to talk to the teacher was mixed with the feeling that I don’t want to see the teacher with my uncertainty about my answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Do I just be myself…? It sounds so simple, but it was so hard to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I honestly respected Nanase-san for doing that in her own life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I want to live like her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But can I really do it?</p>


<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a foreign movie.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya-kun, who was sitting next to me, said so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Today I had a date with him again, and we were at the movie theater we had agreed to go to the other day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, it has probably been a while since I’ve seen a foreign movie too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The last time was when Kinu, Touya-kun, and I watched them together when we had just entered middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But why was that coming up now?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ruri is looking forward to it too, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh… Y-Yes. Right.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But as usual, I was sure I was not smiling… </p>
<p class="calibre3">Ever since the incident that happened on our way home from our date at the aquarium, Touya and I were still in a relationship. But neither of us wanted things to stay the same…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s about to start.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I heard Touya’s words and turned my attention to the front.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately after, the buzzer sounded and the screening began.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The title of the movie we were going to see today was “Freedom.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seems to be a popular movie these days.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As soon as the movie started, Touya and I quietly watched the movie.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, a woman named Iris, who appeared in the movie, caught my attention.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To be precise, it was a Japanese woman named Nanase Rena who plays the role of Iris.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know what!? That ocean is amazing! It’s like there are countless jewels shining right before my eyes!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nanase-san happily expressed .</p>
<p class="calibre3">Was that an act? I found myself wondering.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She really seemed to be enjoying herself… I felt somewhat envious of her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s awesome!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After that, Nanase continued to act as if she was enjoying herself. Everything in her performance conveyed her love for acting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am sure they will understand if you do your best to tell them how you feel.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And I was deeply moved by Nanase’s performance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same time, I wished I could be like her.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Not in the sense of wanting to be an actress or anything like that, but in the sense of wanting to live like her!</p>
<p class="calibre3">That’s what I naturally thought after watching the movie.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Nanase-san went to the U.S. all by herself after high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After leaving the movie theater, I was looking at the pamphlet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the page I was looking at was an interview with Nanase-san, who was making her Hollywood debut.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The interviewer asked her how she was able to become the Hollywood actress of her dreams. Nanase answered that it was because she lived her life as herself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition, she also said,</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Living life as you are is definitely the most enjoyable of any life!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the moment I saw these words, something echoed loudly in the back of my chest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The movie was really interesting!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya, who was walking next to me, spoke to me. He was smiling as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He always smiled when he talked to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I’m sure that smile was the exact opposite of Nanase’s words about being oneself&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’d like to talk to you about something.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said, stopping walking. Then, he stopped walking too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Watching Nanase-san’s performance and knowing what she said made me think.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered if I was living my life as myself now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was in middle school, I made a big mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I should have helped Kinu no matter what the reason.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Until a few minutes ago, I thought it was too late for everything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But now, I was sure it was not too late. Nanase-san made me believe that today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Touya, I knew that&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Wait a minute.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was about to speak when I was interrupted again by Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I won’t hesitate anymore. For my own sake and for Touya’s.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have to tell him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Actually, I have something to tell you as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Unexpectedly, he said these words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was surprised and fell silent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“May I ask you something?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Touya-kun asked, his serious eyes fixed on me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was surprised and kept my mouth shut.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Yes, okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I nodded my head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Touya-kun began to talk to me.</p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">It was exactly one week after his last visit, three days after I saw the movie.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As promised, Kiritani-sensei came to visit my house. Incidentally, both of my parents were at work today.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, I know this is fast, but did you go see the movie?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei asked suddenly as we both sat down on the living room sofa.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I went to see the movie. It was okay.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei looked relieved and took a sip of the hot tea I had prepared for him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Has it made you like yourself?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Before we talk about that… Sensei, can I ask you one thing?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“? I don’t mind, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I told him about something I noticed in the movie and its pamphlet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Japanese actress in the movie, Nanase Rena, was by any chance the person who changed Kiritani-sensei back in high school?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At my question, Kiritani-sensei looked a little surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But then he smiled shyly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I guess you found out.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I knew it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nanase-san said in the interview that she had lived her life as she was without lying to herself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, he himself told me that the girl in his class who changed him was also someone who was always themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition, Kiritani-sensei happily told me that the girl in his class who changed him was now a Hollywood actress, and Nanase-san was a Hollywood actress too. This almost confirmed that she and the girl who changed him were the same person.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, rather than the movie that Nanase-san is in… you thought I’d like myself if I saw her, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s right. Nanase is most like herself when she is acting, and I like her best when she is acting like herself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">So he thought that if I saw Nanase acting, I would like myself too.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To be honest, I don’t think seeing Nanase-san acting would make me like myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei’s face turned down in disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But there was more to my story.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But you know, Sensei, after getting to know Nanase-san, I’ve decided to stop hating myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was the one who confessed to the person whom Touya liked.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I have hated Touya, Ruri, and myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I still want to be best friends with Touya again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The part of me that still loves Ruri.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hated myself like that, but when I saw Nanase, I thought to myself, “I’ll always hate myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought that if I kept on hating myself, it would be an escape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So I will stop hating myself and accept everything.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ll admit that I’m pathetic, weak, and full of mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That’s what I thought…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seeing me suddenly stop talking, Kiritani-sensei called my name with concern.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I couldn’t speak right away, and after a few moments of silence, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei, am I really doing the right thing?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked in an embarrassingly weak voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I could stop hating myself, if I could admit that I had been wrong, I would surely be able to move forward from where I was now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But at the same time, if I admitted to myself that I was wrong, I would feel like I was forgiving myself for the deeds I had done up until now…</p>
<p class="calibre3">These thoughts were making my decision difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry. Kenji-kun is not the kind of person who would allow his actions to go unchecked for his own convenience.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I told him everything, Kiritani-sensei said just that in a gentle tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…You don’t know that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I do.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei replied to my words without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he continued his story.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve been going to Kenji’s house like this, and I’ve been talking with you for a long time. Still, you don’t believe me, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei asked in a confident tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Normally, I would not have believed anything anyone said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was how unsure I was of my decision.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But if he who has done so much for me says so&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I believe you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I answered, trying my best to get the word out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then you can rest assured, Kenji-kun, that you can now admit that you are who you are.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I did not speak back to him, but instead nodded my head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And at this moment, I stopped hating myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I decided to admit that I was pathetic, weak, and full of mistakes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, somehow, I felt a little lighter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perhaps this meant that I had moved forward just a little more than before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Also, Kenji-kun, I’d be happy if you gradually come to like yourself more, even if it’s a little.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… I’ll try my best to do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I can’t do it right now… but when I get everything sorted out in my mind, then I hope I could like myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah. Right now, just hearing that answer makes me happy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei laughed in relief. He was that concerned about me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kenji-kun, now that you’ve admitted what you’ve been up to, what do you want to do from now on?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well… I don’t know exactly how I can live like myself yet… but for now, I’m going to stop my current self-defeating lifestyle.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei told me that I should live my life as I am even if I was a shut-in, but in my case, I thought that in order to live my life as I was, at least I shouldn’t stay inside the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">&mdash;When I told Kiritani-sensei my thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think it’s a very good decision!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was very happy. I was also happy to see that, and at the same time I was a little relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, Kenji-kun, you are going to graduate from being a shut-in, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. But I haven’t decided yet whether I will go to school or not.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’d like to go outside, so even if it was a part-time job, that was totally fine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Anyway, I wanted to change my current life. Even if it was just a little bit, to move myself forward.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m really glad though. That Kenji-kun became so positive like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If Kenji-kun had not felt anything when you saw Nanase, I would have been disqualified as a teacher,” Kiritani-sensei continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If Kiritani-sensei was disqualified as a teacher, then all the teachers in the world would be disqualified as teachers.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, that’s an exaggeration.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, that’s not true. Kiritani-sensei is a good teacher.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I said, and Kiritani-sensei scratched his head in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wasn’t flattering him or anything. I really think he was a good teacher and I was grateful to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I still had one question about him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey Kiritani-sensei, why did you care about me so much?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s because I’m a teacher and you’re a student, of course. Why would a teacher need a reason to help a student?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Maybe you don’t need one…but somehow I feel that Kiritani-sensei has other reasons.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was true that Kiritani-sensei was kind, so he may have taken care of me so far with the sense of helping a student in a normal way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But he always came to my house when he had free time, he patiently engaged me in conversation without forcing himself on me, and he even went out of his way to give me tickets to Nanase-san’s movie.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No matter how kind Kiritani-sensei is, it felt a little strange that he would go to such lengths with a mere student.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well…I didn’t mean to, but maybe because Kenji-kun did something I couldn’t do, it made me want to help you even more.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Something Sensei couldn’t do..?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had no idea what Kiritani-sensei meant when he said that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When did I do something that he couldn’t do?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I, you know, had a crush on someone in high school.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was a little puzzled, and then Kiritani-sensei began to speak slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I tried to confess my feelings to her on the day of our graduation ceremony. But in the end, I couldn’t confess my feelings to her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh…Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because she had a dream. A very big dream.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After answering that, Kiritani-sensei continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So I thought it would be better to support her dream than to tell her how I felt right before I confessed my feelings to her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei looked forlorn as he recalled those days.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Big dream in high school…!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The person you like, Sensei, is by any chance&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yeah. I was in love with Nanase. I think I’m still in love with her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the middle of my words, Kiritani-sensei uttered this in a slightly embarrassed manner.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm…Have you ever thought about visiting her?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In the U.S.? I can’t. I have work to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei replied with a light laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t want to disturb her during the most important time of her life, when she’s fulfilling her dream and having the time of her life.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I-I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I honestly respected what Kiritani-sensei said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are people who could think about the people they love like this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sorry, I’m getting a little sidetracked.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He apologized and continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I couldn’t tell the person I love how I felt about her, but Kenji-kun told the person you love how you felt about her, even if you disregarded the proper process. Maybe that encouraged me to feel a little bit stronger about helping you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s how it was…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei said in a calm tone, and I replied simply. …But as Sensei just said, my confession was not very praiseworthy because the process was bad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I think it’s time for me to go home.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Hearing this, I checked the time on my phone and saw that it had been an hour since Kiritani-sensei had arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He prepared to leave and headed for the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, good luck tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“O-Oh. Umm… Kiritani-sensei, thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No problem, bye.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I began thinking as soon as Kiritani-sensei put his hand on the doorknob.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that I have changed, I was sure that he would never come to my house again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I choose not to go to school, there was a possibility that I would never see him again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kiritani-sensei!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I found myself calling his name.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umm… Sensei saved my life.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">If it weren’t for Kiritani Sensei, I’d still be holed up in my house, turning my back on reality for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei was my only savior.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank you for everything!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thanked him again with all my heart so that he would understand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I’m glad I got to meet you, Kenji-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sensei…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei’s words almost made me cry a little. Those few words really touched my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“See you, Kenji-kun.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Sensei, see you later.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After exchanging a few words with each other, Kiritani-sensei opened the door and left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was a really good teacher. I would like to see him again if I could.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But first, I have something I need to do.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I need to decide my future plans.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Until now, thinking about the future has only made me depressed, so I’ve tried not to think about it at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But now I was excited to think about the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was all thanks to Kiritani-sensei.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani Kakeru-sensei &mdash; he really is the best teacher I’ve ever had.</p>
     <p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">After Kiritani-sensei left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was lying on my bed in my room, thinking about the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In order to change my current situation, I should get out of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It could be going to school, getting a part-time job, or doing volunteer work.</p>
<p class="calibre3">How could I live my life as Kiritani-sensei said, like Nanase-san was in the movie?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Could I, a man full of mistakes, enjoy my own life?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought about it for a while, but I couldn’t come up with an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, it was not so easy to come up with an answer…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“!?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, I heard something fall.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I turned around to see what it was, I saw a soccer ball on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I was in middle school, I always used this ball for self-practice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Well, I guess I left it there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had left it in my room for a long time without throwing it away, even though I had become a shut-in and stopped playing soccer altogether.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I approached the soccer ball and picked it up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The ball was scratched up and had all sorts of marks on it from all the stupid things I had done with it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How much have I practiced?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself as I looked at the soccer ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Before all that happened with Touya and Ruri, I was just practicing hard to become a pro.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I want to give it one more shot.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I want to play soccer again with all my might.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I thought as I looked at the battered soccer ball.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’d also like to get to know my classmates better.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In middle school, I was only with Ruri and Touya.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had teammates in my club activities, but we never hung out together…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I didn’t have anyone I could properly call a friend other than my childhood friend and my best friend.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So when I go to high school, I want to make friends with my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I would have given up on this before, but thanks to meeting Kiritani-sensei, I don’t feel that way at all anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If I’m going to play soccer… I want to join the school’s soccer club after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just a few minutes ago, I greeted Kiritani-sensei like it was my last goodbye, and now I’m going to go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…That was ridiculously lame of me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I stopped going to school in the middle of middle school and since then my life had stagnated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That’s why I think school is the best place to get my life moving again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I haven’t been to high school for more than two months since it started.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If I went to school, I would surely be looked at strangely by my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even so, I wanted to go to school, make friends with my classmates, join the soccer club, and play my favorite sport, soccer, as much as I can&mdash;I want to live the school life that I could not accomplish in middle school.</p>

<p class="calibre3">This is what it means for me to live my life the way I want to.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Anyway, tomorrow I’ll go get a haircut.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I touched my hair, which has grown terribly long. I couldn’t go to school with this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After getting ready, I would go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My classmates would have already made a lot of friends.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the other hand, I naturally don’t know any of my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In that sense, I was very anxious.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I’m looking forward to going to school because I feel like I’m going to be able to spend a different kind of day every day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m going to do my best to be myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered the words given to me by Kiritani-sensei and Nanase-san.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And maybe I was smiling a little at that time.</p>


<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">The next evening after I decided to go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was getting my textbooks and stuff ready to go to school tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I had left the textbooks and stuff in the back of my closet, thinking I wouldn’t use them anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My hair had been cut during the day, and it looked much better. Maybe I’ve become a little more handsome… No, not at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve already told my parents that I’m going to school, and they were both a little surprised and worried that I was pushing myself too hard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But when I explained to them that I wanted to go to school of my own volition, they both encouraged me to do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that time, I honestly felt that my father and mother were too good for me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m going to start now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After I finished getting ready for school, I walked up to the console and turned it on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Before I go any further, I want to say that I’m not going to go back to my old, self-defeating ways after all this time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’ve told my parents, but there’s still someone I need to tell about my decision.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That person was the one who told me it was fun to play games with someone else, the one who helped me when I was at rock bottom.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“It’s been a while, Kinu!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">A few minutes after turning on the game console. A male voice came through the headphones.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was Marumaru.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Long time no see, Marumaru.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because you haven’t invited me to play games at all lately. I thought you were so withdrawn that your parents finally broke your gaming console.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My parents wouldn’t do anything so dangerous.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">What kind of image does Marumaru have of my parents…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since Kiritani-sensei started visiting our house and that was when I started thinking about myself, my games with Marumaru have inevitably decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So it has been a really long time since I’ve talked to him. It’s been about two weeks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Before I met Kiritani-sensei, we used to play games together every day.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thinking about it, it was probably not surprising to imagine that Marumaru had thought my parents had broken my game console.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What game are we playing today?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That would be the usual one, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then we both started playing the battle royale game, which was probably the game we have played the most together so far. The reason I chose this game over fighting games was that I have more free time when I’m playing this game than when I’m playing a fighting game, and it’s easier to talk to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hey, Marumaru.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s up? You want me to coach you on the game?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I don’t. …I need some coaching on something else.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I see. 10,000 yen per hour.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You’re going to charge me? And that’s expensive!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I told him, he laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He teased me, so I got sidetracked…</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, let’s leave coaching out of it for now, there’s something I need to tell you, Marumaru.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Something you need to tell me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I replied, “Yes,” and continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ve decided to go to school tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I told him, and after a short pause, he said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru muttered only that.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His voice sounded a little sad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So, I’m going to join, umm… a club, and from now on I don’t think we’ll be able to play games together as often as we do now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Right. When you’re a student and you’re involved in extracurricular activities, you would be busy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…But I really enjoy playing games with Marumaru and we should definitely play games together again when we have time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I meant this. I really enjoy playing games with Marumaru.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That was why I didn’t want to say bye-bye just because I had to go to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I want to be friends with Marumaru from now on.</p>

<p class="calibre3">『That’s impossible.』</p>

<p class="calibre3">Marumaru unexpectedly said those words.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eh, why…?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I asked, surprised by this sudden turn of events.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu, you’re trying to move forward from now on. Then you don’t need to worry about a clueless guy like me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A guy who is clueless, I don’t know much about that…But I think that Marumaru is a good guy and I want to play more games with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s that? It makes me happy to hear you say that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru replied, but he doesn’t say he’ll play with me in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why not…?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I mean, Kinu, there’s an enemy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was so engrossed in the conversation that I wasn’t thinking about the game at all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I realized it when Marumaru pointed it out to me, but it was too late.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was beaten in no time, and as for Marumaru, he had already been beaten.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s not like Marumaru.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s not like you, either.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">We both said to each other, and then there was silence for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Why does Marumaru refuse to be involved with me in the future so much?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Does Marumaru dislike me?</p>
<p class="calibre3">I recalled the incident with Touya and felt very uneasy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I wish I could keep playing this game with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“! T-Then why…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because nothing good will happen to you now even if you get involved with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What are you talking about? That’s not true.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s true.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Marumaru declared clearly without hesitation. And he continued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If I’m here, if something happens to Kinu, it will be a way out. You’ve moved on… You don’t need me as a safety.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That…may be true, but I&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Kinu doesn’t need me anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As if to cut me off, Marumaru said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He sounded as if he had done all he could do, but he also sounded sad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I need you, I never thought that I wouldn’t need you… Don’t be sad.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But it’s the truth. You have to understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Maybe Marrmaru was right.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But I still couldn’t accept his words, like a child who won’t listen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“H-Hey! Wait! I still want to talk to you&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was saying this, Marumaru’s voice display was turned off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now I can’t hear him anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You can’t break up with me like this…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I can’t believe I’ll never be able to talk to Marumaru again…</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was just as grateful to him for being with me during my most difficult time as I was to Kiritani-sensei, maybe even more so.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let me at least say thank you at the end.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was feeling regret, a message came into the in-game chat.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was from Marumaru.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Do your best.”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Only a few words were written.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But that was enough to convey his feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Marumaru……”</p>
<p class="calibre3">My heart was burning deep in my chest. Shoot, I might cry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But since Marumaru had sent me a message I desperately held back my tears and typed back a chat.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“Thank you so much for all you’ve done!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">I never got a reply to my message.</p>
<p class="calibre3">…But I was sure Marumaru saw it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Surely he knew how much I appreciated him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I looked at Marumaru’s message, I pumped myself up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Tomorrow, when I go to class and take my seat, I will greet the person sitting next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I felt that if I do this, I would be able to change from the person I used to be when I was in a state of depression and start a new person who can live life in his or her own way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I should practice soccer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I haven’t touched a ball at all since middle school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Even if I joined a club, I wouldn’t be able to play well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I can’t do anything about it overnight, but I still need to be able to play a little better.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Holding the soccer ball in my hand, I quickly headed for the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I’m going to do some light practicing in front of the house until my parents come home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Marumaru, watch me. I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once outside, I start training.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I hadn’t been this excited about kicking a soccer ball in a long time.</p>


<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p><br></p>
				<p class="calibre3">“I’m getting nervous…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next morning. I was walking to school alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It had been more than two months since I entered high school, yet, this was my first time actually going to school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As I approached the school, more and more students around me were wearing the same uniform.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Although I had a lot of energy yesterday, walking next to the students like this made me nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I was nervous because some of them might be my classmates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ooh, so this is Seiran High School…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I arrived at the school gate, I looked at the school building.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It had no special features, and its exterior looked like a very ordinary high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In case you’re wondering, I came to the high school once when I took the entrance exam, but I didn’t get a good look at the school building or anything, so I only had a hazy recollection of it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, I entered the school building like the other students and changed my shoes at the shoe lockers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Normally, I would just change into the shoes that were left in the shoe locker, but since it was my first day of school, I had brought my shoes from home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When I took them out of the bag, a student nearby looked at me curiously, which made me feel a little awkward. After that happened, I went to the first-year classroom on the first floor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I was in 1-D, I think.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Walking down the hallway, I looked for my classroom &mdash; found it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I should go into the classroom as soon as possible… But I decided to take a peek inside first.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the classroom, my classmates were each talking in several groups.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was a cheerful group, a quiet group, a nerdy group, and a group of people who were probably club mates. It was a common scene in junior high school.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I muttered to myself over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From this day forward, I will live my life as myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And this was the first step.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let’s go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I opened the door to the classroom with a bang.</p>
<p class="calibre3">My classmates were so engrossed in their chit-chat that they hardly noticed me.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But a few of them were looking at me with looks of “who is this person?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, that’s normal…”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Muttering to myself, I checked the seating chart on the teacher’s table and headed for my seat.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At any rate, as I had decided yesterday, I’ll greet the person sitting next to me first.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That will be when the new me begins.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After arriving at my seat, there was no one to my right, so I decided to greet the person to my left.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I wondered when was the last time I talked face to face with someone my own age.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Kiritani-sensei was a whole lot more mature than me, and Marumaru was of indeterminate age.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I started to get nervous again when I thought about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I take one deep breath in to calm down. …Okay, I’m good.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I then greeted the person next to me with a hopeful expectation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good M&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">I stopped speaking halfway through.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It wasn’t that I was sick of saying good morning, or that I was too scared to stop.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was more that something shocking was right in front of me.</p>

<p class="calibre3">“…Ruri?”</p>

<p class="calibre3">Surprised, I called her name.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then she turned to me awkwardly and said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“…Good morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">She greeted me back in a small voice.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the high school that I finally decided to attend, I found, sitting right next to me, my childhood friend and the person I love &mdash; Aima Ruri.</p>
