<h1>Chapter 3: Studying for an Exam, or Bathe with Her, That's the Question</h1>

<p>Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy, has a two-semester system, which is the first and second semesters, and mid-term and final examinations are held for each sem. The mid-term exam is only an academic exam, and practical skills will be conducted in the final exam.</p>
<p>The first half midterm examination is approaching.</p>
<p>It was their first exam, and there was a sense of tension in the air flowing through the school. The students also, somehow seem to be fidgeting and restless.</p>
<p>For that reason, the lessons are also getting heated.</p>
<p>Right now, Elric-sensei was giving a lecture about combat in a party.</p>
<p>Classes are held in Gran Magia in the form of lectures, and each student is supposed to take a class tailored for each student. Thus, the classroom was seated with students from Blaze, Absolute, Luminous, and Horizon.</p>

<p>“Eh, when forming a party first, what should we be careful about?&#8221;</p>

<p>A Blaze girl, a student named Kyrie Sakuragi with a beautiful black hair, raised her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s don&#8217;t team-up with an Absolute human.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not going to be like that&#8230;&#8230; err, if you were to form a party of four people, it’ll be one from each of the four countries——&#8221;</p>

<p>This time, an Absolute boy, Daniel Cresson, raised his hand. He has a thin face with blond curly hair, just like an aristocrat.</p>

<p>“Making a Blaze a vanguard, is that what you mean. If they show their back, we may be able to stab them from behind at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elric-sensei scratched his head in distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah, in other words, we’ll make a Blaze a vanguard, not because we will stab them from behind, but because we will use them as a meat shield, is that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>“What was that!? You bastard!!”</p>

<p>The Blaze students stood up all at once.</p>
<p>As if to respond, the Absolute side also stood up, and peeked into their sword handles from their uniform pocket.</p>
<p>The Luminous students frown at the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;How stupid &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“As expected, if we don&#8217;t lead them to the right path&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara Strahl, the luminous leading magician, combines the fingers of both her hands,</p>

<p>“Ah, God of Light&#8230;&#8230; please forgive them for their sins desu. Please give punishment for this helpless me who can&#8217;t stop their conflict nodesu…&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>and prays to God for forgiveness.</p>
<p>The Luminous students kneel one after another under Clara&#8217;s feet as she sits in a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Clara-sama! It’s not a sin that Clara-sama has to carry!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Those people have no faith! Clara-sama, they’re not worth praying for!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, they might be heretics! If they have touched the filthy soul of the Evil god, Clara-sama&#8217;s pure appearance will be tainted.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, Clara floated a gentle smile.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p>&#8220;All the unbelievers and also the heretics, are pitiful lost lambs nodesu. If we, the Apostles of Light, don’t save them, what will we do nodesu”</p>
<p>“Clara-sama……”</p>

<p>Tears ooze in the eyes of the Luminous students. Clara&#8217;s appearance was so divine, that it looked as if light was shining from behind her.</p>
<p>They combine their fingers, and all of the Luminous people chant the words of prayer.</p>

<p>“““Lux”””</p>

<p>Horizon students are looking at such a series of events in an amused manner.</p>

<p>“The~y’re doing it agai~n, Luminous Theater&#8221;</p>
<p>“I don’t rea~lly get tired of it~. Well, it&#8217;s funny, but it&#8217;s strange, though~&#8221;</p>

<p>They were clearly sitting without motivation in the back corner of the classroom; chatting, eating snacks secretly, play card games, etc.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>A student applying nail polish on her fingers turned to the side as if she came up with something.</p>

<p>“Hey~ first thing~. Blaze and Absolute are fighting again, aren’t they? Let’s bet~, bet on them”</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh~ let’s do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Horizon&#8217;s head magician, Adelina Earthland, responds with a big smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then~, which will win, Blaze or Absolute!? The main event would be the confrontation between the two leaders!! 10% of the income, will be used as funds for the weekend party, so let’s bang bang!”</p>

<p>Elric-sensei&#8217;s anguish is no longer at the level of despair.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.io/q5t9kSY_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was no wonder that his predecessor dispatched from the Hero’s Guild, suffered from illness in a month.</p>
<p><em>——Ah, if I could get serious in this place, I wonder how good will that feel.</em></p>
<p>When he was thinking of such a thing while becoming teary eyed, he suddenly noticed something.</p>
<p>Haruto and Iris, who usually take the initiative in pulling out their swords, are quiet.</p>
<p>The two people, who were the symbols of Blaze and Absolute’s conflict, stuck their desks together, and are looking into one textbook.</p>
<p>That’s because,</p>
<p>This lecture would be their first time today. The seating order was decided by lottery, but the two of them splendidly drew next to each other.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>And the textbooks were distributed, but one of it was missing. Elric-sensei noticed that fact just in front of Haruto and Iris, and he asked them to use one book.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the two mutually complained about it, but when the class started, they surprisingly became quiet.</p>
<p>Moreover, they’re taking notes with all their might.</p>
<p>Even at this moment, they were busy moving their pen &#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>“……?”</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>What on earth are they taking a note in this situation?</em></p>
<p>Elric-sensei&#8217;s question was natural.</p>
<p>—— Actually, these two people, haven’t even heard a single piece of lesson in the class.</p>

<p>Haruto wrote a message on the edge of a notebook to make it easier for Iris to see.</p>

<p>『That Sazaku guy, was aiming for the revival of the Demon King. That means, that he knew the half body of the Demon king (Juliet), and also the Reincarnation wedding (necromance) in detail. 』</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Iris read Haruto&#8217;s message in the corner of her field of vision, with her eyes dropping on his notebook. And on the page at Haruto’s side, she then wrote her reply smoothly.</p>

<p>『Does he have information that we don&#8217;t know?』</p>
<p>『Probably. We also need to investigate the dark magic association Prospero. 』</p>
<p>『That&#8217;s right &#8230;&#8230; Then, I will ask Principal Ernest about that after school. 』</p>

<p>Principal Ernest Greenwood, had talked about the Dark Magic Association. He must know something.</p>

<p>『Alright, I&#8217;m going to Fatima-sensei. Since she’s a darkness magician. She might have some clues about it. 』</p>
<p>『…… As expected, I wonder if I should go to Fatima-sensei. 』</p>
<p>『Why?』</p>
<p>『Because …… that’s what it looks. Since she’s voluptuous, Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; 』</p>
<p>“That’s stu……ah”</p>

<p>He almost said it out loud.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>『Stupid, it was not something like that』</p>
<p>『You say something like that. But you just want to see her lewd figure!? If that’s the case, then I should』</p>
<p>『That&#8217;s not true! Sazaku used Dark magic, in which he also used summoning magic. Only Fatima-sensei can use summoning magic at this school. She&#8217;s the most suspicious. Will I let Iris go to a guy like that? 』</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; hand stopped.</p>
<p><em>Haruto-kun …&#8230;is worried about me </em><em>❤</em></p>
<p>Involuntarily, her mind loosens, and her icy expression melts.</p>
<p>Haruto&#8217;s feelings for her made her chest feel hot, and Iris feels like she was melting.</p>

<p>『Tonight, let&#8217;s exchange information. Keep the window of your balcony open. 』</p>
<p>『Eh!? You will come? 』</p>
<p>『Ah. I’ll do that after the lights go out. Just at the time when the date changes. 』</p>
<p>『The time for a day to pass and a new day to come &#8230;&#8230; we, who originally wouldn’t be able to meet two times in a day, will meet at midnight for a moment. 』</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><em>——Iris?</em></p>

<p>『It&#8217;s just like us. Fleeting lovers enjoying just a moment of tryst.</p>
<p>In the afternoon dreaming of such a fleeting time.</p>
<p>Ah, I really resent the sun. When the shining sun is in the sky, the veil of darkness won’t descend.</p>
<p>Fast, faster. Sun, run past this blue sky.</p>
<p>And bring along the ruler of the night.</p>
<p>May that person come in the darkness.</p>
<p>But in the true darkness, there’s loneliness.</p>
<p>A sky full of stars. A river of stars in the black sky. Take me along on the ship to the moon. 』  <em>(TN: A poem?)</em></p>

<p>A cold damp sweat spilled over Haruto&#8217;s cheeks.</p>

<p><em>——Iris is being strange.</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Nervously, he looks at Iris’ appearance.</p>
<p>Iris also stares at Haruto.</p>
<p>The girl dyes herself red, and bashfully smiles as if she’s a girl who fell in love.</p>
<p>There’s a light of heart in her pupils.</p>

<p><em>——She’s in a Reincarnation Wedding (necromance)!?!!</em></p>

<p>Right now!?</p>
<p>In a place like this!!</p>
<p>Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous!!</p>

<p>“Err…… Haruto-kun, Iris-kun?&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment he heard Elric-sensei&#8217;s voice on his head,</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“『Flame』!!”</p>

<p>Flames burst in front of him.</p>
<p>Haruto activated magic with his conditioned reflexes.</p>
<p>His aim is the notebook on the desk.</p>
<p>Haruto’s and Iris&#8217; notes turn into ashes in an instant —— in addition, the textbook turned into ashes, and the desk exploded.</p>

<p>“Uwaaaaaaahh!?”</p>
<p>“Kyaaaaaaaahh!?”</p>

<p>In the sudden explosion, the students in front, back, left and right, and Elric-sensei, were blown away.</p>

<p>“What’s that!?”</p>

<p>Th Blaze and Absolute students who were glaring at each other, were surprised and stared at the explosion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Everyone was taken aback by the explosion of flames that suddenly occurred in the middle of the classroom.</p>
<p>Only Adelina was clapping her hands, frolicking.</p>

<p>“Oooh! You suddenly got into a bout, Haruto-san!!&#8221;</p>

<p>With that voice, the students finally noticed. The explosion occurred at Haruto and Iris&#8217; seats.</p>
<p>Claude who changed his complexion,</p>

<p>“Haruto!?”</p>

<p>shouted so, and Francette who turned to the black smoke,</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess!?&#8221;</p>

<p>called out.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>The smoke soon cleared up, and the figures of the fallen students and the desk which has turned into ashes emerged.</p>
<p>And ——,</p>

<p>“Wha!?”</p>
<p>“Ah……”</p>

<p>Francette has her eyes stripped, and Claude looked up to the heavens.</p>
<p>Haruto has pushed Iris down.</p>
<p>He inserted his body in, so Iris&#8217; crotch is open, and his left hand is nudging directly horizontal to Iris&#8217; face.</p>
<p>And his right hand, was crushing Iris&#8217; left chest.</p>
<p>He was tightly grabbing it.</p>

<p>“Ha……Haruto……ku”</p>

<p>Iris solidified with surprise and shame.</p>
<p><em>Fortunately, she seemed to be back to her senses, probably because of the explosion.</em> Haruto, sighs with relief.</p>

<p>“I’m glad…… to your senses——”</p>

<p><em>No!! this is not good at all!?</em></p>
<p>He self-quip involuntarily. Behind Haruto, Francette stood swaying.</p>
<p>Her appearance of hatred, bloodthirst, and negative aura, makes her look like a maid from hell.</p>

<p>“You bastard…… to the imperial princess&#8217; breast &#8230;&#8230; what does this mean?”</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.io/dEQLmD6_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium" alt="" /></p>

<p>“N,no, this is, an accident”</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t talk nonsense!! Even though you were rubbing it with all your strength! Besides, what is that posture that seems like you will make a child at any moment!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I,it’s different, Francette. This is—— ahh ❤!”</p>

<p>Haruto&#8217;s fingers, which he involuntarily put force, created a pleasant sensation in Iris&#8217; sensitive chest.</p>

<p>“My,my bad”</p>
<p>“I……it’s fine, so get off of me fast!”</p>
<p>“U,understood! This is an accident! No one wants to touch your boobs ——&#8221;</p>

<p>His left hand, which was supporting his body, slipped.</p>

<p>“Buho!?”</p>

<p>His face touches Iris&#8217; right breast.</p>

<p>“Kyaaaaahh!? Ahn ❤&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto&#8217;s face was wrapped in happiness as he was taken in by the finest cushion.</p>
<p>Claude who scratches his head as if he was amazed,</p>

<p>&#8220;How will you smooth this over&#8230;&#8230; Haruto”</p>
<p>&#8220;I,I won’t forgive you! I will never forgive you!! Haruto Shindou!! On behalf of the Royal family and all of the empire citizens, I’ll defeat you!! Even though I, don&#8217;t have the chance to massage it about once a week!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing the livid Francette trying to attack Haruto, a Horizon girl asked Adelina.</p>

<p>&#8220;He~y, tha~t’s, wha~t were you betting on?&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelina folded her arms, groaning, and then,</p>

<p>&#8220;Breast Compaction! Harurun&#8217;s erotic home run!!&#8221;</p>

<p>she made the worst verdict.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>After that, due to the breast compaction of Iris, a Northern Demon (Tempest) was born, and they were adequately confused, but they somehow resolved it at the end of school.</p>
<p>And Iris, who had an exchange in writing using a notebook, requested to visit the principal.</p>

<p>“Ah, this is rare. What do you want from me ——Iris Shylveene&#8221;</p>

<p>With white hair and white beard. In a really magician-like figure, Principal Ernest welcomed Iris.</p>

<p>“Yes…&#8230; excuse me for my intrusion”</p>

<p>She entered the principal’s office for the first time. Iris was firstly, overwhelmed by the bookshelves which were all over the wall. And, on the other wall, various instruments that seemed to be magic tools are there. At first glance, they look like a stick or a box, but the tools are emitting some kind of effect. And samples of magic stones were lined up in a row by the window.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of types of them in all. They reflect light, and give off a beautiful colorful glow.</p>
<p>Among them, was a familiar stone.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>The black-glowing round jewel, is the stone that Sazaku used in transfer magic.</p>

<p>&#8220;That stone, is Black onyx. It&#8217;s a stone that dark magicians like to use. Since it&#8217;s easy for it to capture the magic formula of darkness. &#8221;</p>
<p>“……That’s, indeed”</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have any reminiscence of that stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N,no. As I said &#8230;&#8230;. for all that, I would like to know more about the darkness magic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Principal Ernest, raised one eyebrow.</p>

<p>“Why, was that again?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Principal-sensei mention it himself. We have to know the enemy. Particularly, I didn&#8217;t know the existence of the Dark Magic Association. Who the hell are them&#8230;&#8230; could you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>When the principal walks to the other side of the desk, he sat comfortably on a leather chair.</p>

<p>“The Dark Magic Association huh……”</p>
<div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-96753337' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-96753337' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p>While stroking the white beard on his chin, he draws his eyebrows together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the details. But what is certain, is that their purpose is to resurrect the Demon King.”</p>

<p>Iris&#8217; chest pounded.</p>
<p><em>Resurrect the Demon King &#8230;&#8230; as expected.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Those guys are fanatics who wish for a world dominated by demons. They’re planning to destroy all the order of this world, and create a new world. For that reason, they are willing to destroy or kill anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the heck &#8230;&#8230; will want such a thing?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard that the history of that magic association is over a thousand years, but their true identity is unknown. To this day, we still haven’t captured one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>For a thousand and several hundred years, no one?</em></p>
<p>Iris, wondered if there’s really such an organization? She doubted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not speaking of delusions, you know? We at the Hero’s guild, doubted their existence many times. However, they certainly exist. Only their traces can be found. Nevertheless, when we do try to approach the abyss of the Demon King, their evil hands will surely come.&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>“……how can you say that”</p>
<p>&#8220;They also have victims in the Hero’s Guild.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Wha……”</p>

<p>The Hero’s guild is full of strong men. They are heroes who transcended the conflicts between nations, and also had noble spirits that held out great ideals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if they are a member of the Hero’s Guild&#8230;&#8230; are they unable to compete with them?”</p>
<p>&#8220;They use darkness magic. The magic of darkness feeds on human hatred, resentment, envy, and emotions like that. Their power is tremendous, and if it’s simple power, it will be stronger than any other magic. However, no one will become happy of that. It’ll bring darkness to the world, to the hearts of people, and will destroy them. Even to the magicians themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though it doesn’t exist, it exist.</p>
<p>They have a grudge against the world and people.</p>
<p>Their existence is like an apparition.</p>
<p>Before she knew it, she had the illusion of them standing behind her, and Iris’ spine shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;They blend in with our society, and they do secret maneuvers with a nonchalant look. I have no idea who is a member of whichever country. They’re exactly a secret association.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p>An organization that has no backing, and stride across doing secret maneuvering between nations.</p>
<p>It’s the opposite of the Hero’s Guild.</p>

<p>&#8220;Although, I only know the name of the secret association.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Their name……. what is it?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Prospero —— the ones who will lead the world to collapse and bring the world of the demons. That is, our enemies”</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>When Iris was enquiring in the principal’s office——,</p>
<p>Haruto was in Fatima-sensei instructor&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>He barged in with the excuse that he had a question for the exam. He knocked on the door many times, but he didn&#8217;t get a reply, so he opened the door without permission and came inside.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know why she was pretending be out, but perhaps she didn&#8217;t want to talk to Haruto. Or maybe——,</p>
<p><em>Because there’s something wrong &#8230;&#8230;. or like that.</em></p>
<p>Haruto, asks Fatima-sensei, who still has the same expression as before.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Teacher, I have something I want to ask for a little with the darkness magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Keeping silent all this time, she was staring at Haruto.</p>
<p>Haruto also, carefully observes Fatima-sensei sitting in a chair.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t even know when will she attack.</p>
<p>Even though he has such vigilance, the appearance of Fatima-sensei hinders it.</p>
<p><em>Sh*t……she has an erotic posture! You’re still calling yourself a teacher!?</em></p>
<p>Her cleavage is almost exposed, and it seems like her nipples will be in view soon. She has constricted abdomen and vertically long navel. Her crossed legs are generously exposed to the base of her thigh, and she is showing off her beautiful splendid slender legs.</p>
<p>Then, around her navel​, the accessories attached on her ankle were strangely unpleasant.</p>

<p>“Let me hear it clearly, are you related to the Dark secret association?&#8221;</p>

<p>In order to directly compete with Fatima-sensei&#8217;s sexiness, Haruto drew closer.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>“……Eh”</p>

<p>It felt like she said something faintly, but he can&#8217;t hear it.</p>
<p>When Haruto approached Fatima-sensei, he approached her face as close as he could.</p>

<p>“What was it? Tell me clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>“A……ah”</p>

<p>Fatima-sensei suddenly fell into a suspicious behavior. She seems to be sweating slightly.</p>

<p>“The only one who can use Darkness magic in this school, is you. What the hell are you up to!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hii!&#8221;</p>

<p>Screaming like a small animal, Fatima-sensei runs away.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>When she stood up, she tried to run through the side of Haruto. However, Haruto grabbed Fatima-sensei&#8217;s wrist with composure.</p>
<p>And then, he pressed Fatima-sensei&#8217;s body against the wall.</p>

<p>“Auhh!?”</p>
<p>“Resign yourself! Why did you try to escape!?&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto put his other hand next to Fatima-sensei&#8217;s face——hitting it against the wall.</p>
<p>At close range, he looks into her purple pupils.</p>
<p>As Fatima-sensei was thinking, she opened her trembling lips.</p>

<p>“……I thought I would be violated, so” <em>(TN: in other words, rape!! </em><em>ヾ</em><em>(•ω•`)o)</em></p>

<p>She slightly dyed her cheeks, and muttered so in a mosquito-like voice.</p>

<p>“Vio……?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Understanding what that meant, Haruto shouts like he’s spewing bubbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,isn&#8217;t that stupid!? Su,such a thing, I won’t do that!!”</p>
<p>“Hmmm…… you’re a boy around that age. I understand&#8230;&#8230; But, since I already resigned myself&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Fatima-sensei turned her face away shyly, her eyes were only directed towards Haruto. <em>(TN: LOL, just how thirsty is this girl!?)</em></p>

<p>“Sensei too…… it’s my first time. If you treat me gently&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll be glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time, it was Haruto&#8217;s turn to go red.</p>

<p>“A,as I said! It’s different! I,I’m just——”</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8230;&#8230; take proper responsibility on me, alright? If we make a baby, acknowledge——”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>On Haruto&#8217;s forehead, cold sweat suddenly flows.</p>
<p><em>No way……</em></p>
<p><em>Isn&#8217;t this an ingenious trap!?</em></p>
<p><em>Right now, I am cornered in a ridiculous predicament!? </em></p>
<p>When Haruto let go of her hand,</p>

<p>“Thank you very muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch!!”</p>

<p>he then ran away with lightning speed while shouting so.</p>
<p>In the end —— this day, Haruto, had no achievements.</p>
<p>Haruto realized the horror of women again.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>Then, at night.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>In the Blaze Dormitory, a study session was held as a preparation for the exam.</p>
<p>Everyone gathered in the hall, took up their favorite subjects, and taught students who were not good at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It’s three days until the exam. This is also a fight. Let&#8217;s do our best with the will to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Claude’s blasting, everyone responds with &#8220;Ohh!&#8221;.</p>
<p>But——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we have to have a study session”</p>

<p>Only Haruto, was complaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped, isn&#8217;t it. There are people who have poor grades and have a certain red mark. As a Blaze, you can&#8217;t get a single red mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah? Who, was that guy who&#8217;s dragging you guys&#8221;</p>
<p>“““You are! You!!”””</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Everyone except Claude quip at him.</p>

<p>“Eh, me?”</p>

<p>Kyrie, a girl with long black hair, glares at Haruto, who has a face like he’s surprised, with her damp eyes.</p>

<p>“Other than you, who is there? It&#8217;s embarrassing that our head magician has a red mark,            so we’re holding a study session like this, aren’t we”</p>
<p>“Geez, you’re worrywarts, you guys”</p>
<p>“……I wonder where that confidence comes from.&#8221;</p>
<p>“It’ll be fine. Somehow”</p>

<p>Despite saying that, Haruto was a little self-conscious of it.</p>
<p>His practical skills are perfect, but he’s not good at classroom lectures. However, there was a reason why he wanted to escape from the study session even if he put on a brave front.</p>
<p>Haruto, glances at the clock on the wall.</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>——it’s twenty-three o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>The time for his appointment with Iris was approaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, don&#8217;t worry about me. I&#8217;ll somehow do it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, he pulls out while throwing that remark, and tries to leave the hall.</p>

<p>However, Claude stopped such Haruto.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Haruto, I&#8217;ll give you some questions. If you answer all the questions correctly, you can do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Tsk …&#8230; it can&#8217;t be helped. Come at me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First question. A poisonous swamp spreads out at the end of the road. If you take a detour, you will not be in time for an appointment. How will you deal with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Haruto laughed with his nose.</p>

<p>“It’s too easy, so don’t be moved to tears”</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? It seems easy, and there are various methods to cope with it. In addition, the amount of information is overwhelmingly insufficient with the problem statement alone. You will need to have multiple answers based on some conditions, but&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to. There is a way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone gulps their breath.</p>

<p>“I’ll burn my underfoot completely!!”</p>

<p>Silence, dominated the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;What’s wrong? Did you all get impressed by my perfect answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s shocking, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kyrie looked at Haruto with her eyes as if he was an idiot.</p>

<p>“Why”</p>
<p>“Because you can’t do that, can you!? Burning down the swamp! You’ll usually use medicines to eliminate the poison and restore your physical strength, you know. Moreover, what if the swamp was so large? Like the schoolyard of the academy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With three or four Meltdowns, I can do it, can’t I?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho,how can you hit it with advanced magic that much!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do it, you know&#8221;</p>

<p>Kyrie plucks off her hair.</p>

<p>“Claude! Ask your next question!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re going to subdue a golem with a six-person party. What kind of magic attributes will you want in organizing your members?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Flame attribute alone is enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>“That’s impossible!!”</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve defeated something like those before. Well, Iris was there too, but I didn’t have any problem with them honestly.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Cla……Claude”</p>
<p>“Yeah!&#8230;&#8230; A dragon-like demon appears——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Burn to death!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Claude held his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, how will you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>“With Ultimate magic&#8221;</p>

<p>——<em>It’s no good. This guy. (TN: A very definition of Muscle brain)</em></p>
<p>All the people other than Haruto who were there, thought so.</p>
<p>Claude repositions his glasses in order to regain his temper.</p>

<p>“Haruto…… this is a classroom exam. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you can, or can&#8217;t do it. I mean, Ultimate magic is impossible even for Haruto, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the truth.</p>
<p>Ultimate magic—— It&#8217;s a magic whose theory was established about a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>However, it requires an enormous magic power, a frighteningly complicated and enormous amount of magic formulas, and no one has materialize it. It was, so to speak, a hypothesis on magic theory.</p>

<p>“Well…… I&#8217;ll show it to you someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, you’ll have red marks like this. I can&#8217;t let you go back to your room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, what should I do&#8221;</p>

<p>Claude handed Haruto a pile of workbooks.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really want to do something by yourself, you can study in your room. But, finish all of these. By tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……I understand. I should do it, shouldn&#8217;t I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto left the hall with a collection of problems full in his arms.</p>
<p>As he walked down the hallway, Haruto muttered alone.</p>

<p>“……Everyone, I’m sorry”</p>

<p><em>I can understand their feelings of worry about me painfully. </em></p>
<p><em>However, tonight is no good.</em></p>
<p><em>But——,</em></p>
<p><em>In the end, I’m just betraying everyone, aren’t I? </em></p>
<p><em>The problem workbook I had in my hand was heavy.</em></p>
<p><em>The weight of this book, is everyone&#8217;s expectation for me.</em></p>
<p><em>We must prevent the invasion of the Northern Demon (Tempest). At the same time, we cannot lose to the Absolute Empire.</em></p>
<p><em>I myself, haven&#8217;t forgotten the grudge I had when they killed my family.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to crush the empire. </em></p>
<p><em>I want to protect this world where everyone lives.</em></p>
<p><em>However, what I am doing is completely different.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m lying to everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>My most serious betrayal of them is, knowing that I and Iris have the half-body of the Demon King, me dating Iris.</em></p>
<p><em>The world is trying to block the resurrection of the Demon King, and fight the Northern Demon (Tempest).</em></p>
<p><em>If, I think for the world, I’ll prevent the Reincarnation Wedding (Necromance), by thinking of a way to avoid meeting Iris for the rest of my life, or if that&#8217;s not possible &#8230;&#8230; either one of us will have no choice but to die.</em></p>
<p><em>However I, don&#8217;t feel like taking either of them. </em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t want to destroy the world.</em></p>
<p><em>But, I don’t want to be sacrificed and die for the world.</em></p>
<p><em>To kill Iris as a sacrifice, I don&#8217;t want that either.</em></p>
<p><em>I refuse to destroy the world or lose Iris.</em></p>
<p><em>——Then, what should I do?</em></p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>He has no answer.</p>
<p>Haruto, while holding a collection of problems in both hands, dexterously turns the handle with his fingertips.</p>

<p>“…….Dammit!”</p>

<p>Haruto kicked the door hard with his foot and entered the room.</p>
<p>He put the pile of workbooks on his desk.</p>
<p>It was quite a lot. It can be said that he can’t finish it until the morning arrives.</p>

<p>&#8220;But &#8230;&#8230;. this collection of questions has its answers prepared, right? This’ll be easy”</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Though the problem I have in my heart right now, doesn’t have an answer.</em></p>

<p>“My goodness…… I never run away or give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are many things that he has lost.</p>
<p>Sometimes he was in pieces, was weeping, frustrated and couldn&#8217;t sleep.</p>
<p>Even so, he didn&#8217;t give up.</p>
<p>And then, he finally succeeded.</p>
<p>So, when he looks back on the past, he thinks.</p>

<p>“Easy peasy”</p>

<p><em>That’s why even this time, as I think about it, I&#8217;m sure it’ll be a cakewalk——,</em></p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>An unfamiliar box was on his desk.</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-30391567' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-30391567' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>He casually opens the box.</p>
<p>In there——,</p>

<p>A round stone was there glowing in black.</p>

<p>“——!?”</p>

<p>The next moment, Haruto&#8217;s body was sucked into the magic circle embedded in it.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>Iris was waiting for Haruto to come in her room at the Absolute dormitory.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><em>——Ah, I wonder if he’s coming early.</em></p>
<p>At the same time as she thought so, she was scared that the promised time is coming.</p>
<p>Her chest is pounding, and she was about to die.</p>
<p><em>Did I, make any mistakes in making preparations?</em></p>
<p>She looks around the room.</p>
<p>It’s a very small room. <em>The closet of the castle is still wider than this place.</em></p>
<p><em>But, once I grew accustomed to it, I found that this is just right. The room in the castle was just too large.</em></p>
<p>The place was tidied up properly. It didn’t have a single change of clothes left out.</p>
<p>Flowers were also laid out accordingly, and the paintings, which was decorated on the wall, were upstanding.</p>
<p><em>The beds were also in place, and it was like Francette had arranged it.</em></p>
<p><em>……Bed.</em></p>
<p><em>No, my cheeks are getting hot.</em></p>
<p><em>Probably because of the nervousness, I was a little sweaty. I might have sweated a little because I had cleaned up. </em></p>
<p><em>……Aah!?</em></p>
<p><em>What if Haruto-kun thinks that I’m a sweaty woman!?</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><em>It’s already 23 o’clock.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s okay. I have time to lightly drain my sweat. Even if I don&#8217;t get my hair wet ——.</em></p>

<p>When Iris decided so, she went to the bathroom and began to take off her clothes in a hurry.</p>
<p>She quickly removes her mantle, and takes off her jacket.</p>
<p>After worrying about what to do with her clothes, she ended up wearing her uniform, but she may want to take this opportunity to reconsider it.</p>
<p>When she took off her shirt and put down her skirt, her snow-white skin appeared.</p>
<p>With no single blemish, it was incredibly smooth, and fine skin. On such a body, a made-to-order highest-class underwear was put on. As if to emphasize the beauty of her skin, the area covering her private part was made as small as possible as well.</p>
<p>A lace with floral design, and a see-through thin silk-like material were used heavily on it, and in that small area, elegance and bewitching-ness just barely goes against each other.</p>
<p>For Iris, she thought that she would take the plunge and chose a sexy one.</p>
<p>After all, Haruto is coming.</p>
<p>In addition, Reincarnation wedding (necromance) may also occur. No, it would happen.</p>
<p>So, there’s a high possibility that he would be able to see her underwear.</p>
<p><em>It would be okay if I was seen by Haruto, or rather, my heart would pound ——</em> <em>that’s what I thought, so I selected it, but if I became sweaty, I would need to change this as well, wouldn’t I.</em></p>
<p><em>However, it’s unavoidable. Besides, it feels like I tried a little too hard on this underwear.</em></p>
<p><em>A little bit more grown up, may have more likability&#8230;&#8230; </em>then, Iris puts her hand on her back, and unhooks her white bra.</p>
<p>Her unsupported chest, pops forward a little. Blooming at the tip of her pure white breasts, were her cherry-colored nipples. Seeing herself in the mirror, Iris tilted her head anxiously.</p>
<p><em>Haruto-kun, what will he think of this…&#8230;?</em></p>

<p>He had seen her in her underwear, but he has never seen her naked.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>Iris tried lifting her breasts, which are a little too big for her slender body, from below with her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough, I feel that the balance is a little bad…&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>A little more modest, would’ve feel more elegant and refined.</p>
<p>But when she told Francette that she would try a partial diet before, she remembered that she denied her with all her might.</p>
<p>Francette that day was,</p>

<p>『You currently have the best balance! Rather, it&#8217;s fine even if it&#8217;s a little bigger! That’s why, let me nurture it! Every night, I will massage the princess&#8217; boobs!! 』</p>

<p>Of course, she refused it with her full force.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said that boys prefer bigger ones, but &#8230;&#8230; is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris grasps her own chest, by herself.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><em>Certainly, its sensation may not be bad.</em></p>
<p><em>Moreover, it feels a little nice.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, she remembered that Haruto rubbed her boobs in the classroom the other day.</p>
<p><em>It feels, good…… </em><em>❤</em></p>
<p>As she noticed it, she was caressing her breast by herself.</p>

<p>“……Hah!?”</p>

<p><em>What are you doing, me! It’s immodest!!</em></p>
<p>When she turned bright red by herself, she hurriedly put down her pants and threw them into the laundry case. And then, she jumped into the bathroom as if to escape.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she hasn’t drained out the hot water yet. When she put her feet inside it, she gently felt the lukewarm hot water. She sunk her body in it up to her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Haa……”</p>

<p>She sighed unintentionally —— at that time,</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>A violent sound of water echoed.</p>

<p>“!?”</p>

<p>Splashes flew over her face, depriving her of her vision.</p>
<p><em>——Wha,what!?</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, it seemed like the hot water in the bathtub had exploded.</p>
<p><em>Was it some kind of accident or a breakdown? </em></p>
<p>Iris wipes the hot water on her face, and when she looks forward——,</p>

<p>Haruto with an amazed expression was in the bathtub.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>The two people looked at each other silently.</p>
<p>It took them a while to grasp this reality.</p>
<p>When Haruto&#8217;s gaze directly goes down, and faces Iris&#8217; quivering body inside the hot water,</p>

<p>“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!”</p>
<p>“Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooouuuuuuhhhh!?”</p>

<p>Iris hugged her chest, raised her knees, and hid her body.</p>
<p>Haruto jumped back with all his might, making him hit the back of his head against the wall.</p>
<p>Haruto who returns to himself, quickly reaches out his hand and pins Iris&#8217; mouth.</p>

<p>“I,Iris. Don&#8217;t shout!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps Iris has calmed down a little, since although her eyes remain open in surprise, she nodded a little.</p>
<p>When Haruto releases his hand,</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“……Kyah”</p>

<p>In a small voice, she screamed, in which she refrained from.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that you were surprised. I mean, I was so surprised that my heart seemed to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Uh,uhmm…… you’re much earlier …… than planned”</p>

<p><em>This isn’t the place, to quip. </em>That’s what Haruto thought, but he goes through with that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, I was inside my dorm room, but I was suddenly transferred …… I wonder what happened to me somehow &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>While saying that, his eyes swim over Iris&#8217; skin arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Her nape was soak with drips of water. She has smooth shoulders. Her cleavage in her arms, sways according to the movement of the hot water. She has a beautiful line from her waist to toes passing through her knees.</p>
<p>Her most vital part, seems to be visible but not visible, it’s giving him a brief glimpse.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Feeling Haruto&#8217;s gaze, Iris shrank her body.</p>

<p>“M,my bad……”</p>

<p>With his face facing sideways, he gets up from the bathtub.</p>
<p>When he stood up to the washing place, he thrusted his hand towards the wall, and he exhaled a sigh so deep that it looked like he was about to exhale his soul.</p>

<p>“Uh,uhhm…… Haruto-kun? You said you were transferred&#8230;&#8230;?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t understand what happened. When I opened the baggage that arrived in the room, a black sphere stone was in it, and &#8230;&#8230; when I noticed it, I was transferred here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black &#8230;&#8230; stone&#8221;</p>

<p>The specimen Iris saw in the principal’s office flashed in her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was probably, the Black onyx. Principal-sensei said that it was something that Darkness magicians often use.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Then, as he was about to unintentionally turn around, he was hit on his back with Iris&#8217; reproachful gaze.</p>

<p>“……I’m sorry”</p>
<p>“No, I knew it wasn&#8217;t Haruto&#8217;s fault&#8230;&#8230; in other words, Sazaku embedded a magic formula of transition on it, and sent it to Haruto. That’s why……”</p>
<p>&#8220;Their aim would be to transfer me to Iris’ bath and let that bother me huh&#8230;&#8230; However, at the time Iris was taking a bath, I wasn’t confined to open the luggage, but ——&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Ah, I see.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“……The transfer magic would be of Sazaku, but the good timing is probably due to the Reincarnation Wedding (Necromance).&#8221;</p>
<p>“Perhaps, that’s right……”</p>

<p>Haruto took a deep breath to regain his senses. The result of that was, he inhaled to the fullest, the sweet fragrant of a girl, which filled the bathroom.</p>

<p>“——Mi,mind as well. As planned, let&#8217;s exchange information. What about the principal?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p>“Yes. He taught me various things——”</p>

<p>Iris tells Haruto what she heard from Principal Ernest.</p>

<p>“I see. Then that Sazaku, was our first contact of Prospero.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun &#8230;&#8230; How about Fatima-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Uh…… that’s”</p>

<p>The pathetic result of only scurrying away, he was wondering how could he conveyed that.</p>

<p>“Successful…… I couldn&#8217;t pull out any information from her.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I see, this is tough. In that case, is the true identity of Sazaku really is Fatima-sensei as expected?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sazaku also wore a mask, and changed his voice. His figure looked like a man, but he may have deceived them using magic.</p>

<p>“That may be so. She must’ve realized that we&#8217;re being suspicious of her, so I guess she used such a hand.”</p>

<p>Haruto scowls while facing the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;That guy knows our relationship. If he exposed this relationship&#8230;&#8230; it would be bad”</p>
<p>“Yes…… but, isn&#8217;t that unlikely to happen?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Sazaku&#8217;s purpose is to revive the Demon King. We are…… that’s, if it was revealed that we were dating, it’s definite that we can&#8217;t stay in the academy anymore. We will be pulled apart. And if it is known that the Demon King&#8217;s half body is inside our bodies&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re lucky, we&#8217;ll be imprisoned for eternity. But, thinking normally about it, we’ll be executed huh”</p>

<p>From the perspective of the Prospero bunch, Haruto and Iris who attend the same school and can have contact with each other, was the situation they desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, I think, Sazaku wants me and Haruto-kun&#8230;&#8230; that’s, to do it more from here on, eh. I guess he made you come to me, to have us do ecchi things…&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“We have to be on guard……”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>The two people were alone in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Moreover, Iris is naked.</p>
<p>Right now is exactly, a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>In fact, the two just noticed that their situation hasn’t changed for the better.</p>
<p>If the aphrodisiac effect of the Reincarnation wedding (necromance) gets activated, today may become the last day of the world.</p>

<p><em>——By any chance, we,</em></p>
<p><em>——Perhaps, we,</em></p>

<p><em>Are standing on the brink of world destruction!?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>This is bad. I have to leave here right away.</em></p>
<p><em>At this late hour, I just realized why would we be talking inside the bathroom.</em></p>
<p><em>I should’ve gotten out of the bath at once!</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>&#8220;For the time being, I&#8217;ll come out first——&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment she tried to reach the door handle,</p>

<p>&#8220;Iris-samaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!&#8221;</p>

<p>The knocking sound on the room’s door roared.</p>

<p>““Tuh!?””</p>

<p>The both of them stopped with a jolt, by that shout.</p>

<p>〇 〇 〇</p>

<p>Iris, as if to hide her voice, told him with a whisper.</p>

<p>“Thi,this Francette. Most likely, she heard our screams some time ago……”</p>
<p>“What do we do?”</p>
<p>“I’ll deceive her, so Haruto-kun should hide here.”</p>
<p>“Got it. I ask you”</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll go out, so as it is &#8230;&#8230; can you not stare at me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like the world is going to perish if I look at you. So, I won’t absolutely look.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that time, the sound of Francette repeatedly slamming the door, and screaming continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess! Princess!&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>&#8220;Aah! <em>Mou</em>, you’re noisy, Francette!! You’re bothering the neighborhood, so please stop!”</p>

<p>Behind Haruto, the sound of Iris rising from the bathtub can be heard. And with the sign of her body leaning directly behind him, Haruto himself stiffened.</p>

<p>“Uhmm…… If you leave as it is, you will have a cold, so please warm yourself inside the hot water. Your uniform as well, can be dried later. If you were to leave it near the door——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Princess! Are you safe!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m coming out soon. But, I’m inside the bathroom. Therefore, please wait”</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re taking a bath!? Does that mean, that you’re stark naked!? You’re nude!? Without a single thread, in the appearance you were born, are you saying it’s like that!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut that mouth of yours, Francette!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris furiously rushes out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Haruto was left behind.</p>
<p>Through the frosted glass of the door, he can see Iris who wrapped a bath towel around her body. In an angry voice, she speaks to Francette in the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just a little surprised! You see, a black insect came out in that instance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that! If it saw the princess&#8217; soft fair skin, even if it’s an insect, I won&#8217;t forgive it. This Francette will dispose of it.&#8221;</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-96785891' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-96785891' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p>“I,it’s fine. It has already gone somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>With clattering footsteps, Iris’ figure disappeared from behind the frosted glass.</p>
<p><em>I’m a cockroach huh</em> —— like that, Haruto draws back his face.</p>
<p>He now has no choice but to hide quietly. With his body trembling.</p>
<p><em>It must’ve been because of my wet uniform getting cold. I’m afraid that I’m going to sneeze. </em></p>
<p><em>In this situation, I thought it would be impossible to take a bath in Iris&#8217; room, but &#8230;&#8230; unexpectedly, it may be better to do as Iris says.</em></p>
<p>Haruto, with wrinkles between his eyebrows, was troubled.</p>
<p>In conclusion—— he started to take off his uniform.</p>
<p><em>I won’t be able to escape this urgent problem without making some sacrifice.</em></p>
<p>When he became naked, he put the clothes he took off on the floor near the door, and gently, put his toes in the bathtub so as not to make a noise.</p>
<p><em>As I was about to dip my shoulders slowly…… to be honest, it feels good. </em></p>
<p>He finally noticed that his body had been quite cold. If this is the case, he would’ve likely sneezed and Francette would’ve noticed him, wouldn’t she.</p>
<p>Iris had been in this hot water until now, and that fact shocked him.</p>
<p>That this hot water had lick every corner of Iris’ body, and that it had touched all of her parts.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>It’s a natural thing.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, Haruto was strangely throbbing by that fact.</p>
<p>His cheeks were hot, and his palpitations became intense.</p>

<p><em>No way &#8230;&#8230; the effect of the Reincarnation wedding (necromance) is coming out towards me!?</em></p>

<p>Haruto, tells himself to stay calm.</p>
<p>His body however doesn&#8217;t listen to him.</p>
<p><em>Kuh……no good, this bath is!! </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>When he gently got out of the hot water, he did an imposing stance in the washing place.</p>
<p>In front of him is a large mirror.</p>
<p>However, in the current Haruto, even if he looks in the mirror, Iris’ nude body was reflected in that mirror——that’s what comes to his mind.</p>
<p><em>Damn it! What should I do&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>After being troubled, Haruto came up with a method.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><em>If I look at something that is similar to Iris but doesn&#8217;t match her well, then I’ll never be reminded of her.</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, I’ll look at myself in the mirror!</em></p>
<p>Haruto bends his arms, and raises his muscles.</p>
<p><em>If this is it, I wouldn&#8217;t think of Iris &#8230;&#8230; Nn?</em></p>
<p>Haruto put a lot of force into his abdomen, and floated his abs.</p>
<p>……<em>Just a minute, did my muscles weakened?</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps, I became weak?</em></p>
<p>Speaking of which, he was busy lately and tended to skip his strength training.</p>
<p><em>——This is bad.</em></p>
<p>Even though he’s a magician, his body is his capital. In Blaze, training your body, is very close to training your magic.</p>
<p>In case of an emergency, it’s their body that they can rely on, and it’s the strength of the mind and body that will ultimately decides the match in a fierce competition —— that’s what he believed.</p>
<p>Perhaps Iris has gone completely out of Haruto&#8217;s head, from the thought that he has become weaker. His sense of fear stood first.</p>
<p><em>Let’s check it properly……</em></p>
<p>In front of the mirror, when he started to fully do a pose——,</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, I&#8217;ve driven Francette awa&#8230;&#8230;y&#8221;</p>

<p>The bathroom door opened, and there is Iris smiling.</p>
<p>And that smile freezes.</p>
<p>To Haruto who was making muscle poses naked, Iris&#8217; thought circuit freezes.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>It was an unexpected sight for her.</p>
<p>——Or rather,</p>
<p>Haruto undressing his clothes, and taking a bath —— he himself forgot to say such a thing to her.</p>
<p>With the joy of successfully repelling Francette, she was completely blown away from her head.</p>
<p>If anything, she was——,</p>
<p><em>I need to get Haruto, who was waiting for me, out of the bathroom right away </em>—— like that, she thought in a hurry.</p>
<p>Hence——</p>
<p>The moment she opened the door, a naked man which was posing jumped into her eyes; it would be no wonder that she was astonished.</p>
<p>Then, as a matter of course,</p>

<p>“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!”</p>

<p>She screamed.</p>
<p>The footsteps sprinting through the hallway are approaching again.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Princess! What happened!? Princeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesss!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the room, the sound of Francette drumming the door roared.</p>
<p>Haruto was convinced.</p>
<p>That this is a dangerous place where he could die.</p>
<p>So to speak, it was like he’s riding on the palm of the Demon King&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p><em>I have to leave here as soon as possible!</em></p>
<p>When Haruto grabbed his clothes on the floor, he hid his front quite barely, and ran through in front of Iris.</p>
<p>Then, he was in Iris&#8217; room for the first time.</p>
<p>However, he can’t afford to immerse himself in such deep emotions.</p>
<p>He ran towards her open balcony.</p>
<p>Originally, she opened it for him to come in, but it was just a straight exit for him.</p>
<p>Haruto, while naked, jumps out of the balcony of Iris&#8217; room.</p>
<p>He immediately floats his body in the air with the Material transfer magic 『Movement』. And then, so that he won’t be discovered, he raised his altitude.</p>
<p>The night breeze, cools his burning skin and head.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>It was a miserable night.</p>
<p><em>No, it wasn&#8217;t over yet.</em></p>
<p><em>If I go back to the dormitory and do the collection of problems.</em></p>
<p>Like that, when he thought so——,</p>
<p>From Canal Grande, the grand canal that flows through Grandia, he saw huge tentacles creeping up.</p>
<p>It has eight legs with suction cups.</p>
<p><em>Octopus!?</em></p>
<p>However, its size is staggering. The thickness of its legs is large, and has a diameter of about 2 meters.</p>
<p>Its feet had entwined the tower of the cathedral which was along the canal, pulling its huge build to the land.</p>
<p>A soft, flabby, and ominous head had appeared. Unlike an octopus, it has horns, and has a number of googly eyes.</p>
<p>Org Specter. A level 14 monster.</p>
<p>When attacked by that, no ship can’t stand that. Even big ships, almost certainly will sink. The troublesome thing, is that it also comes up on land. Many coastal villages, were attacked and wiped out by it.</p>
<p>The downtown area of ​​the town is still lit, and many people are going back and forth. People from there, pointed to the Org Specter, and shuddered in terror.</p>

<p>“Uwaaaaaaaaahh! It’s a Northern Demon(Tempest)!!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Why is that here!? Nooooooooooooo! Heeeeeeeeeeeelp!!”</p>

<p>The church’s tower is about to break, and underneath that, there were people who were stuck in fear.</p>
<p>The only ones who can counter it, are the teachers of the Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy, but —— probably, they won’t make it in time.</p>

<p>“Aaaaaah! Goddammit!!”</p>

<p>Haruto pulled his sword out of his wet uniform pocket. Then, he wrapped his uniform trousers he was holding around his face.</p>
<p><em>A quick attack!</em></p>
<p><em>If I was seen fighting in such a figure, I’ll die!!</em></p>
<p>However, he was perfectly seen.</p>
<p>People looked up and pointed at the skin-colored object which was running through the night sky.</p>

<p>“Look! What is that!?”</p>
<p>“A person? Is it a magician!?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>When they saw a man, whose face was covered with a black mask, and was stark naked, the people shouted.</p>

<p>“Hentai————————!!”</p>

<p>Haruto points his sword at the Org Specter, and thrusts it into that.</p>

<p>“『Fire Wall』!!”</p>

<p>He deployed a magic circle at the tip of his sword.</p>
<p>The effect of entering the bath with Iris was so terrifying, that his magic power has strangely increased.</p>

<p>“Here I goooooooooooooooooo!!”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Org Specter’s foot that moves like a tentacle, tries to knock Haruto down.</p>
<p>However, the magic circle that he deployed before, tore that leg apart.</p>
<p>Blue blood spouted from that, and dyed the roofs of the houses blue.</p>
<p>Haruto&#8217;s momentum didn&#8217;t stop.</p>
<p>And then,</p>
<p>He crashed into Org Specter&#8217;s head as it was, and penetrated it.</p>
<p>As its legs entwined in the tower lose their strength, the Org Specter became gooey, and it fell as if spreading out on the ground.</p>
<p>Haruto turned his sword at it, as if to do a finishing blow.</p>

<p>“『Valcan』!!”</p>

<p>A rapid fire of flames, burns the Org Specter&#8217;s body. In the vicinity, there was a nice smell.</p>
<p>Seeing that, the people boisterously dance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you! Thank you, naked magician!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that fine sword, good courage; that guy is a hero!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naked hero!!&#8221; <em>(TN: LOL)</em></p>
<p>“All right! It&#8217;s a grilled octopus party tonight!! Let’s extol the courage of the naked hero!&#8221;</p>

<p>The streets of Grandia unusually became excited. This, was the moment when a new legend, the naked hero, which will be handed down to the future, was born.</p>
<p>Haruto, with an <em>unable to endure it for a second</em> feeling, ran away.</p>
<p>——While naked.</p>
