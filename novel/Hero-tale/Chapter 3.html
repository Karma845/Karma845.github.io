<h3>Chapter 3 - Before the Storm.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after the Festival of Valour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the final examinations were two days away, today was a day of rest for all candidates.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, for one, am also taking today off, but&#8230;.that&#8217;s only if nothing went wrong.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, many unexpected things happened during the selection process, such as uninvited visitors and fewer people passing the examinations than expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up in the inn, had breakfast and headed for the castle.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I visited the headquarters of the Selection Examination Administration, located in the castle, I found Rushia there on official business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia. Paperwork in hand notices me and greets me cheerfully, to which I respond.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The window of the room was open, probably because of the nice weather. A pleasant breeze and the bustle of the city came into the room through the window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe it&#8217;s because the final exams are coming up, but there&#8217;s a lot of activity in the city.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu. Thanks to that,it&#8217;s given us more work, but that&#8217;s a good sign..When I think of the time when I was tormented by the&#8230;..poisonous demon dragon, the vitality of the royal capital is heartbreaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said, deeply moved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are the candidates still at the castle?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, after breakfast they are free to go out on their own. The green-shadowed Huzen and his party are going to the weapon shops,the iron-spear Fina and her party are going to the stalls, and the red-haired Alex and his party are going to the Court Magic Institute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each showed individuality in the way they used their rest days. Some were busy preparing for their final examinations, others were looking for a change of scenery, and the rest&#8230;..were free to choose how they wanted to spend their time.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing Ned?　I thought you were supposed to be on holiday today too&#8230;”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, as much as I&#8217;d like to take a day off&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, this is not the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought this was the time I had a chat with the party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Umu. If there&#8217;s anything I can do, please let me know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. I&#8217;ll be counting on you in case of an emergency.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped by the castle because I wanted to report this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the Examination Administration and headed out of the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned–san…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, someone calls out to me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, there was a blonde girl standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.what’s with the unexpected look on your face?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing, I wasn&#8217;t expecting to be approached.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered honestly, Seren looked uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that this perception is not entirely wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last night, you stopped a party trying to break into my room, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. you noticed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I would have noticed if it had made that much noise&#8230;Well, to be honest, I could have solved the problem on my own without your help, but let me just say thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is more disciplined than one might expect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No&#8230;.If I think about it calmly, Seren behaved normally to everyone but me during the first round of interviews. She behaved belligerently in the second round, but I guess she wasn&#8217;t unmannerly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least she didn&#8217;t break any rules. She is just greedy and wants to win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. We, too, have a responsibility to run the examinations.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren looked mystified as I replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. let me ask you one thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren says in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Hero Party Selection Test&#8230;. who do you expect the winner to be?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it okay for me, the management side, to answer that question?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren looked more anxious than ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is probably thinking about that girl at the moment. The girl with bluish black hair and a slender body, the girl who is an equal to Seren in the B block of the  Valour Festival.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, there you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was struggling to answer, someone called out to me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman in pure white armour was approaching us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Re,rerere,Re–Rese!?”</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Re= rerere = re = rese,Who is Rese?&#8217;</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren was understandably upset but Riese was talking to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, regular report. All security is set, all clear. The 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』will continue to stand guard,other than that any news from you?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not particularly. Keep me posted&#8230;&#8230;but can you at least report back to me using the communication stone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was going to do that, but I happened to spot Ned heading for the castle. I just thought, since you’re in the vicinity, I&#8217;d like to meet you and talk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m convinced of every word she says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me, Seren was staring at Riese with a stern face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese looked at Seren for a moment, but──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I shall leave you now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wai–t!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tried to turn on her heel, but Seren stopped her with a loud voice.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you ignoring me!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;if you&#8217;re glaring at me so hard, I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;m comfortable talking to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wasn&#8217;t glaring at you!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You were glaring at her so hard&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ri,&#8211;Riese! I am disappointed in you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren pointed to Riese and told her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, Why?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you&#8217;ve been caged by this man!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren says, pointing at me this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a terrible thing to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Caged?….That&#8217;s strange to say.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why do you sound so convinced?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I know, I&#8230;..! Riese, you would be stroking this man&#8217;s head and hugging him in private&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. That would be comforting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese nodded, completely unashamed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An–and the other day you were giving a lap pillow in the carriage, weren&#8217;t you&#8230;.!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, it was very relaxing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation is not going anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Riese is good at this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hold up, Wait. If I let you guys continue to talk, it&#8217;s going to ruin my reputation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, why does Seren know so much about us?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s given a lot of thought to the time and place.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;Are you stalking Riese?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren. You seem to misunderstand, but Riese is the type of person who wants to spoil any young child, not just me. So it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve cajoled her…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Such nonsense. The only man I like to spoil is Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh….?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my eyes wide at the unexpected words that came out of Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren was already glaring at me like a demon, but I&#8217;ll leave her alone for a bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..No, I&#8217;ve definitely heard that story. Riese is always on the verge of a motherly outburst towards younger people, so if I don&#8217;t act as an outlet for her, she might eventually commit a crime&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, that&#8217;s a lie my subordinate made up on their own. My party said that if I told you that, Ned would be reluctant to spoil me&#8230;..Oh, so you believed them. I shouldn&#8217;t have told you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve decided not to believe in the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People call them the strongest adventuring party in the Kingdom of Enuvidia, but this is what they are when they open the lid. The people should know more about this fact. Then my headache will lighten.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Generally speaking! What&#8217;s going to happen if you spoil a man like this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren, whose face turned red with anger, glared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your behaviour is perverted from the outside!　It is unhealthy! It is sexual!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Sexual is a little bit of an exaggeration.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren, it&#8217;s just that you don&#8217;t know how Ned’s lives. This man has always worked hard towards his goals, and even when he has experienced setbacks, he has always stood up for himself. When I see him like that, I want to&#8230;..protect him and help him, or rather, I have the desire for him to entrust everything to me&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving Riese to talk about her proclivities and reasons with an ecstatic expression on her face, I began to move on to other places.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Leave it to Seren to preach to Riese&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a stupid idea, but maybe me and Seren could hit it off. Because we both want Riese to be better.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That is not the time to think about this. I need to find them&#8230;..as soon as possible.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went outside the castle and started to look around for that person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Roughly ten minutes later. I found the person I was looking for in a corner of the main street&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeeeeeeee &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaaahhhh &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a crying child and a little girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The child is a boy, probably about five years old. He is wailing and shedding tears without paying attention to his surroundings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And next to him, crying as well, was &#8211; Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. What an odd situation..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of combination is this? Why are they crying on the street this early in the morning?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of Alice who is no longer a little girl by any means, crying with the boy baffled me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Alice, wiping away her tears, looked at me and noticed my presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, umm!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice approached me, pulling the child&#8217;s hand, and called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where is the Fountain Square&#8230;.!!?”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived at the fountain square, a woman who appeared to be in her late twenties rushed up to us in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she was the mother of the boy Alice was crying with. The boy pulled away from Alice and hugged his mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After parting with the grateful parents and child &#8211; I ask Alice what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I see. You intended to help a lost child, but you, yourself, had become lost too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry! I&#8217;m so sorry&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice bowed her head repeatedly and apologised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who left the Kingdom of Enuvidia a year ago and was active in the Amdo Empire until a short time ago, seems to have completely lost her familiarity with the Royal Capital. The result of her taking on the task of guiding the way, without realising it, was the scene where I saw two of them crying together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s true&#8230;.. I&#8217;m useless after all&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked completely dejected and muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t even guide a lost child, and in the end, I&#8217;ve caused you trouble and&#8230;.really, I&#8217;ve always been a no good, no good person&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, tears appeared at the corners of Alice&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked into her eyes and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, you say you’re not a good person, and yet you want to be a hero?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was at a loss to give a reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A bad person cannot be a hero. However, Alice, who lacks self-confidence in herself, is probably not comfortable with affirming herself to someone face to face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just kidding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smile lightly at Alice, who is half crying and half in trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, where are your other members?  &#8230;..Exzair is not with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes. I&#8217;m a bit separated at the moment&#8230;..Philia-san and Kirch-san are out shopping&#8230;..E,Exzair-san is out at the moment, on business&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“on business?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye,yes! I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know. &#8230;&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice replied a little impatiently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;ll take my leave──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped Alice as she was about to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, there is an urgent request from the Adventurers Guild to take down a monster. If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like you to help me.　I&#8217;ll let the other members know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, er,you see&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to speak to Alice, who is puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, you can refuse. It&#8217;s a personal request, so it has nothing to do with the test. However, it seems that the monster is so vicious&#8230;that if we don&#8217;t deal with it soon, we could be in a dangerous situation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tell her the seriousness of the situation, Alice, who had been previously frightened, becomes calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll go with you&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a brief hesitation, Alice said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If there&#8217;s someone in trouble, I&#8217;d like to&#8230;.. help them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Thank you. Then, please follow me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew Alice would say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I led Alice to her destination, I took out my communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After activating the communication stone, I briefly told the other person what I wanted to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May? I have a small favour to ask you──”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deep in the forest. A huge monster lurking in a lake emerged with a violent splash of water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Giga Winikis. It is a nasty fish-type monster with a dorsal and tail fin as sharp as blades, and in addition, it ejects a mass of water from its mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two days ago, a fisherman was victimised by this monster, and yesterday a woodcutter was its victim. Even without approaching the lake, the Giga Winikis is a ferocious monster that shoots water at any creature it finds within range, no questions asked. It was decided that immediate action was needed and a request was made to the guild to take it down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Snow Origin》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The snow emblem engraved on the pure white blade of the sword lights up with a phosphorescent glow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Alice drew her sword, and after a short delay, Giga Winikis’s body was cut in two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I–I&#8217;m done. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. You’re a lifesaver.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice sheathes her sword. There is no scar on her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a strength that makes anyone fall in love with her and a timid personality that makes her uneasy to watch. Alice, who had both of these qualities, seemed to be somewhat unbalanced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you hurt?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes, I&#8217;m fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s good to know. It would be a disaster if she got hurt before the final exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that happens, I shouldn&#8217;t have entrusted her with defeating the monsters from the start&#8230;&#8230;.I actually have something I really need to talk to Alice about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked along the lake on our way back to Royal Capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice is really strong. You may say your Existence Power Level 5, but&#8230;.you’re probably closer to 6 already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8230;much, I don&#8217;t really feel it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese’s guess was right, Alice apparently does not care that much about her own strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that she has defeated the monster, Alice is probably on the verge of finally reaching existence strength 6. Perhaps her Existence Power will increase during the final test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; If you’re so strong, you could have defeated more parties at the Valour Festival, couldn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pft.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice jumped in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, rather than being surprised &#8211; she is upset, like a child whose hidden blunder has been exposed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha–Tha–That&#8217;s not true. &#8230;&#8230;! Aa, at the time, I had my hands full,and besides, everyone else was strong, or how can I say&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning her eyes away, Alice makes a desperate excuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slender figure approached the lake in a wobbly manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, watch your step&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee? ──Hyaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time she realised, it was too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice slipped and fell into the lake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu–ueee&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Alice emerged from the lake, tears were running down her eyes, mixed with water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her long, bluish black hair was wet and soaked in the water.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p199-720x1024.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y–yes&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. Thank you very much…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hold out my hand and pull Alice to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Alice as she climbed out of the lake and I immediately looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, what&#8217;s wrong &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You might want to cover up the &#8230;&#8230; front.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my eyes averted, I pointed at Alice&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because her clothes had become wet, Alice&#8217;s white underwear was exposed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice notices her own appearance, hurriedly turns her back towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she had a slender body, but it seems she has some unevenness. The modest bulge of her breasts and the nips of her waist clearly showed the femininity that the young Alice had concealed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sssssssorry,!!! Showing you unsightly things &#8230;!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the fact that her clothes are skin tight against her skin, her rear view is also quite stimulating. With just a slight movement, her hair sways, each time revealing her skin-coloured backside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly took off my jacket and handed it to Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, put this on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa–thank you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice thanked me and put on the clothes she received from me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve always wondered how Alice could be so feeble when you are so strong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I start a conversation as we are walking again, Alice gives me a complicated look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8230;..I&#8217;ve always been a bit of a failure&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her eyes downcast, Alice said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Up until secondary school, I went to a local school. It was a much smaller school than the academy in the capital, but&#8230;.I didn&#8217;t make any friends there either&#8230;.. I&#8217;m not good at talking, and I was always a bit of a coward&#8230;..But that&#8217;s why I decided to at least try to be strong. I had been aiming to become a hero since then, and I thought that if I became stronger, people might turn to me for help&#8230;..So, as soon as I got out of school, I went to the Adventurers Guild and just kept on taking requests. I was like this, so people around me thought I was just someone who went home right after school&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..But you still kept going to the guild and slowly improving your abilities?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;..I&#8217;ve had plenty of time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice affirmed haltingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia and I were childhood friends and classmates. In school, Phylicia was the only one who got along with me, but she didn&#8217;t seem to realise that&#8230;I was working as an adventurer. So when I came back from the Amdo Empire and told her, she was &#8230;&#8230; terribly angry. 『Why didn&#8217;t you say anything?&#8230;..In the end, it was my fault. I was clumsy, I was a coward, and I&#8217;ve been spinning my wheels no matter what I do&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I kept failing] then only I realised that Alice had a negative personality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a common story. In Alice&#8217;s case, however, it was perhaps a little stronger than others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Rin, too, was troubled before he became a hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mutter, remembering a certain person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to say to Alice, who looks at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice&#8217;s goal is to become a hero like Rin, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yu, you know Rin the Brave?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Alice&#8217;s surprise, I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unlike Alice, Rin has quite a fast-paced personality, but he had the same problems as&#8230;.Alice. He has always been really bad at acting seriously and trying to fit in with others&#8230;.and he thought he would probably die without getting deeply involved with anyone until the end of his life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why he feels like a hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin is a hero who has become more famous for his petty acts of helping people than for his battles against the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a village is half destroyed, he helps to rebuild it and rather than hunting down the enemy, he reaches out to someone in front of him. He has honestly achieved little in the way of results in battle, but his approach to the people instead has led to a strong sense of popularity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From Alice&#8217;s point of view, did Rin the Brave seem not serious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice shakes her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From Alice&#8217;s point of view, did Rin the Brave seem uncoordinated?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice shakes her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Same for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first I thought that heroes are all perfect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s hard to notice when you&#8217;re admiring someone, isn&#8217;t it?　But if you open the lid, even heroes have a problem or two. Heroes that everyone admires&#8230;. are also struggling like ordinary people in places where everyone else can&#8217;t see them. So Alice, you don&#8217;t have to worry about every single failure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a line that could be said not so much to Alice, who is aiming to be a hero&#8230;.but to Alice, who is aiming to be the hero Rin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are those in the world who became a hero after suffering, struggling and overcoming their complexes. Their existence will be a beacon for Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, Alice wouldn&#8217;t be that timid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to say to Alice, who has round eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“[You&#8217;re a hero, but can you run away]&#8230;..not many people can say that line so clearly. And Alice has a character that can&#8217;t overlook people in need. You will help lost children, help defeat dangerous monsters and if you are truly a coward, you would have shut yourself up in your shell and done nothing. Alice, properly, has the conviction befitting a hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice had somehow raised her face, which had been downcast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look straight at her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I ask you again&#8230;.you really could have beaten a lot more parties during the Festival of Valour, couldn&#8217;t you? So why didn&#8217;t you dare to do so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her, Alice answered with a small quiver of her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s because &#8230;&#8230; you told me to&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says, grabbing her water-soaked skirt tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“[If you really want to be a hero, I expect you to be honest.] &#8230;..Ned–san told me that, and&#8230;I, too, thought you were right&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those were the words I told Alice just before the Festival of Valour began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems my words were heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped and looked at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s time to cut to the chase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you being blackmailed by Exzair?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Alice, who was wide-eyed and at a loss for words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After the first round of exams, I did a whole bunch of research on the candidates&#8217; identities and backgrounds. As a result, I got information on a lot of parties, but I couldn&#8217;t find out anything about&#8230;..Alice&#8217;s party. Perhaps there is some kind of cover-up going on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Alice, who instantly looks frightened, I continue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the Amdo Empire, there is a certain organisation that I have been unable to find out anything about, no matter how much research I&#8217;ve done. Alice&#8217;s party and that organisation match up in my inability to find such information&#8230;&#8230;.so I&#8217;m already aware of your involvement with that organisation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s &#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with the power of that organisation, they could easily get one or two tools that could nullify the blessings of the God of Judgement. They used those tools in the interview to make sure they wouldn&#8217;t be found out to be lying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But from what I can see&#8230;.Alice is the victim.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her calmly so that Alice would not be confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I&#8217;m hoping that Alice will tell me what&#8217;s going on now. I expect the&#8230;&#8230;ringleader to be the man who assisted you in the interview, Exzair, but you don&#8217;t need to worry about that man right now. I&#8217;ve asked someone I trust to stall him, so he shouldn&#8217;t be able to get here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair has special armaments that allow him to move through space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, if I want to be on the lookout for that man to eavesdrop, it does not make sense to just keep him away. Someone needs to stick with him around at all times to prevent him from using his special armaments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, I&#8217;ve asked Meir to play that role.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve told her to use her title of test director to buy time &#8230;&#8230;but it&#8217;s Meir. I expect that she wouldn’t able hold Exzair for too long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, but&#8230;..I&#8217;m&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice seemed to be trying to squeeze out words somehow. However, no matter how long I waited, she did not speak clearly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;I&#8217;m not strong enough to push her’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she is being threatened hard. Alice is now losing her mind out of fear rather than calmly agonising over her options.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice. Who do you trust most in this world?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s eyes dart at this abrupt question, but she eventually answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ry, my parents and&#8230;.party, my friends&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Party member. Does that mean Phylicia and Kirch are her friends other than Exzair? Or is it a bluff to hide the threatened case from me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, and also&#8230;..Rin the Brave&#8230;..trusts&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is someone Alice admires. Naturally, she would also trust him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, I&#8217;ll leave it to Rin then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Alice who had a curious look, I pulled out a communication stone from my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I connect with the person I&#8217;m looking for, I briefly tell him what I&#8217;m doing and hand the communication stone to Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can speak freely…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hand the communication stone to Alice, who holds it close to her ear with a puzzled expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hello, helloーI&#8217;m Rin the Brave.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Eh?”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice knew that the magical tool given to her by Ned was called a communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had never used it. Originally, Alice was a person with extremely few acquaintances, and after meeting that man in the Amdo Empire, she was forbidden to have any tools related to communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time she had touched an actual communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So Alice put the communication stone to her ear with unsteady hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Are?　Is it still connected?　Oーi, it&#8217;s Rin the Brave.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t mishear──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, ah, um&#8230;! Um, um, I&#8217;m Alice!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">あ、あああ、あのっ！　あのあのあの、わ、私──アリスでしゅっ!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ahahaha!　You&#8217;re too nervous!　Yes, yes, Alice-chan.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin&#8217;s bright laughter can be heard over the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s face turned bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry we can only talk over the communication stoneー Aa, how do you know about me?　I heard from Ned earlier that you have a crush on me. Well, I&#8217;m glad nevertheless.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fa–Fa–far far from it! I&#8217;m sorry that I&#8217;m the one who admires you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">と、ととと、とんでもありません！その、私なんかが憧れて、申し訳ないですっ！</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice, the tone, was definitely that of the hero Rin. Alice is convinced because she admires him&#8230;.It&#8217;s Rin the Brave. She is now talking to the real Rin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a loud [DON!!!] was heard over the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is as if he had punched something with great force. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Er, er, Rin–san&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aaーer, sorry. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s a hassle, but I&#8217;m kind of fighting a monster right now.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?? A–aa,are you okay!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;m fine, I&#8217;m fine. I can handle this much.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin says in a fluent tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I don&#8217;tー&#8230;&#8230; like fighting too seriously&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin says in a laid-back atmosphere that is disproportionate to the intense sounds of battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Because if you&#8217;re fighting with a kind of serious expression on your face, you make people feel uneasy, right?　I&#8217;m a hero, after all, and I don&#8217;t want people to feel scared. I&#8217;m moderately relaxed to show that I&#8217;m totally relaxed&#8230;. In other words, it&#8217;s about my personal preoccupation, so there&#8217;s no need for Alice-chan to be concerned about it at all.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A rumbling sound can be heard. It must be a stormy, fierce battle raging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the voice emanating from Rin&#8217;s mouth gives an idyllic, calm impression, as if he were spending time in the long, quiet countryside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know what you mean&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice smiles happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you saved me from being attacked by a monster on the outskirts of the village,&#8230;&#8230; Rin–san had a kind expression on your face the whole time, as if you were trying to put people at ease&#8230;..I was&#8230;..to such a Rin-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Alice&#8217;s words, Rin spoke after a short pause.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Alice-chan&#8230;&#8230;are you perhaps the girl who helped the village at the foot of the mountain?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,you remember!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yahー, I remember you, properly. You&#8217;re the girl with the long hair, right?&#8230;..because you were looking at me with those sparkling eyes at that time. &#8230;&#8230;I see, it was already five years ago…』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s hands trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t think Rin would remember her -Alice was filled with uncontrollable emotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『So now you&#8217;re a candidate for the Hero Party&#8230;&#8230; You’ve worked hardー』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;. yes&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes were burning. Alice shook her head repeatedly, wiping away the blotting tears with her fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『So? What happened Alice-chan, what are you worried about now?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin&#8217;s question brought Alice back to her senses.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Right. This isn’t the time for sentimentality.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, actually&#8230;..right now, Ned–san is asking me a certain question&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a trembling voice, Alice says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s a question I should answer. But&#8230;I&#8217;m too scared&#8230;to answer it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice could not explain the situation so easily, even when dealing with the person she admires.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She feels inferior to her own poor speech and cowardice. She doesn&#8217;t know how it happened. The remorse was now so exhausted that she was no longer able to think properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Let&#8217;s seeーthe person infront of you is trustworthy, you can talk to him. I can swear to this in the name of Rin the Brave.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin said in his usual easy–going tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, the battle with the monsters was settled, and the sounds of battle could no longer be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned, you see, is a man who fights with his connections.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Connections, is it &#8230;&#8230;?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes. Well, in a word, someone who knows a lot of people.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice realises how easily Ned introduced Rin the Brave. He certainly has a wide network of contacts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『But, you know, I think this is a sword vine with many blades..』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin&#8217;s voice was a mixture of respect and dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Because he is connected to so many people, if he does anything wrong, rumours about him will spread quickly&#8230;..but there are no such rumours on Ned. Ned itself is a puritanical character&#8230;&#8230; but I&#8217;m sure that anyone who stood beside him is convinced of that. Ned is always doing the right thing, he says. &#8230;He, himself swore that he won&#8217;t  turn to blackmail, fraud or injustice.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Rin spoke of was the strong determination from Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『So, Alice–chan, you can feel free to rely on Ned. Ned is a friendly guy, so you just need to say a few words and he will help you. I&#8217;m sure that wherever you are, the Ned will help you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin&#8217;s respect for Ned was noticeable.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What kind of man is Ned–san who is spoken of so much by the hero Rin?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm..who is Ned exactly?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hmm&#8230;.just a normal person.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『But you know, if you ask him for help he&#8217;s the one person you can count on more than anyone else.』”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Rin&#8217;s conversation continued for some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, I take out a stack of papers I had tucked away in my pouch and check to see if there is any unfinished business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I rolled up the paper and read over my notes, Alice handed me back the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked, and Alice opened her mouth, her snow-white cheeks flushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um! Is Ned-san the leader of the party that first conquered the underwater ruins discovered on the Central Continent!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice asked me excitedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, and there are also stories that Ned-san was chosen as the next chief of the legendary&#8230;..Fenrir tribe, and that he obtained the elixir of immortality said to lie dormant in Kakusenkyo&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I’m a little loss on this 閣仙郷. I just typed the hiragana for it)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.That guy talks too much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I refused to take the next chief position, and I sold the Elixir of Immortality at random, so I don&#8217;t even know where it is now. I continue to hear from Alice that Rin told her about my background in a rambling manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what do you think?　Are you ready to answer me now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice must be planning to tell me herself, since she cut off communication with Lynn and returned the communication stone to me. I wait for Alice to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are right, Ned–san&#8230;.I am being threatened by Exzair–san. He&#8217;s holding my parents and my party members hostage&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, I can see that point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been difficult to even ask Alice what was going on because they are being held hostage. If she leaked this to the outside world, they would bring harm to the hostages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does your party members&#8230;..Phylicia and Kirch know about this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;.they don&#8217;t know. I am the only one being threatened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had somewhat expected that. Before the start of the Valour Festival B block, I met with Phylicia and Kirch, who, unlike Alice, did not seem too alarmed by Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice trusted me, thus she spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess the persuasion of Rin the Brave worked, but I am sure that she has put her trust in me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I have a duty to respond to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice. You don&#8217;t have to think about anything else. I&#8217;ll take care of everything, Alice&#8217;s parents, your friends, everything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Alice, who looked like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Alice, in your next final exam──do what you think is right.”</span></p>
