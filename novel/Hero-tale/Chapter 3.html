<h3>Chapter 3 - Heroes for Whom.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Waking up in her canopied bed, Rushia Enuvidia felt pain deep in her chest before she even realised she was awake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the start of the dragonisation disease, she had been complaining of pain in all parts of her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the pain, Princess Rushia guesses the timing of the seizure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. seems to be doing alright today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe the medicine she got from Ned last night has had an effect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That man is quite insane. Princess Rushia had forgotten all about it because it happened so suddenly, but there is no way that a normal individual would normally be in possession of an all-powerful elixir.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But even&#8230;&#8230;universal elixirs can&#8217;t cure dragonisation disease.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia knew that long ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After washing her face and changing her clothes, Princess Rushia left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Warm sunshine was shining through the window, but it did not clear her mind at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Last night, she talked too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She couldn&#8217;t keep her cool because she was told that she had dragonisation disease. As a result, she confided everything. Her mother&#8217;s death, her trauma&#8230;Princess Rushia now thinks that she didn&#8217;t need to talk that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It could make a heavy burden on Ned.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, Princess Rushia decided to visit Ned&#8217;s room once. Ned has been given the right to come and go freely in and out of the rooms of the Royal Castle. As it was still early in the morning, he was probably in his room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she continued walking down the corridor, someone approached her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a tall, blonde woman in pure white armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Riese Von Aldiana, Leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo, you are the leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』. Mm&#8230;&#8230;.I thought you looked familiar.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once upon a time, when a coalition force was formed to defeat the poisonous dragon, Riese was the adventurers&#8217; representative. Princess Rushia did not see the battle first hand, but she is an S-class adventurer and heard that her performance was tremendous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But why are you here?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I have something to tell you, Your Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To tell me&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia was a little surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, it is customary to make an appointment and arrange mutual schedules before meeting, but the fact that she has come to see her in person suggests that she may have something urgent to discuss. The fact that she is the leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, it is understandable that she has permission to enter the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, I thought you were working with Ned? I can&#8217;t find Ned&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had heard about the relationship between Ned and Riese to some extent through May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no sign of Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That boy has already left the city.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing these words, Princess Rushia felt as if she had been poked in the heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It reminded her of the abomination she had exposed last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned must have been disgusted with herself and left the kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I, —I see. Well, of course. I don&#8217;t think Ned wants to face me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The possibility of Net fleeing the country has always been on Lucilla&#8217;s mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For that man, it is the easiest way out. It is not a strange story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But despite Princess Rushia&#8217;s dispirited look, Riese  tells her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His destination is the nest of the poisonous demon dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Eh?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Princess Rushia asks back, Riese makes it clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned went to slay the poisonous demon dragon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three hours had passed since I left the royal capital at dawn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Squinting at the dazzling sunrise, I caught a glimpse of the scenery changing at a tremendous speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The regular sound of hoofbeats was made by the fastest horse in the kingdom of Enuvidia, a type of horse known as a wind-whipped horse. Me, May and the other members of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 were travelling in a carriage drawn by this wind horse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can see it.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even on the rough ground, the wind horse continues to drive lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the violently shaking body of the vehicle, I realised that my destination was near.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The northern part of the Kingdom of Enuvidia. In that inhospitable land, there was a huge crater that could have swallowed the entire city. As we approach the centre, the ground is stained a poisonous purple. My entire body felt a small tingling pain just by being there, as if the evaporated poison was mixed in with the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ The nest of the poisonous demon dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The centre of the crater was filled with a purple miasma and visibility was poor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was definitely a monster there. A genuine monster -a tough monster called a dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage stopped and I headed towards the centre of the crater with the knights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way, I stumbled over a step and almost fell.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who was walking next to me, supports me as I almost fall over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad, Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re unwell, take the day off. This is one time I can&#8217;t cover for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem. I just stayed up all night preparing material for&#8230;&#8230;persuasion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Persuasion?] as May tilts her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t need to explain that now. I pulled myself together and looked at the view in front of me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, May said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will never forget how you stood up for Princess Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[That&#8217;s very nice of you] I said with a small laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only me, the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 and May are here now. In order to secure the means of transport, I desperately needed one of the Kingsguard Knights to help me. After much deliberation, I called out to May, and I think&#8230;&#8230;she was the right choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ —Now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, the enemy seemed to have noticed our presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The miasma that had been rising swirled up and scattered into the sky.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the master of the miasma appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tyrant, the Poisonous Demon Dragon which harbours a deadly poison and has caused countless deaths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let the subjugation begin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights drew their swords.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The appearance of the Poison Demon Dragon was one of the most fearless and horrifying of all dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its huge body was covered with poisonous purple scales, and its twin eyes, which glowed gold in the miasma, moved busily.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saliva dripped from between its mismatched fangs and sizzled as soon as it touched the ground, releasing the miasma. Its muscular, twisted and crooked claws gouge the ground just by putting their weight on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First squad, charge!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of Riese&#8217;s subordinates shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The area around the poison demon dragons is always filled with a purple miasma. Prolonged exposure to this could lead to the development of various diseases as well as the dragonisation disease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So we split into several squads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first team approached the poison demon dragon and attacked it. Then, before coming into contact with the miasma for a long period of time, they will move away from the poison demon dragon and the next team starts their attack in the opposite direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First squad, retreat! Second squad, charge!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second squad takes the vanguard. The first squad, which had moved away from the poison demon dragon, concentrated on recovering and checking its physical condition.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By repeating this, everyone could avoid prolonged contact with the poison demon dragon and sustain the attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So this is the Poison Demon Dragon&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s even more frightening than I&#8217;d heard in the stories.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this the first time May seen a poisonous demon dragon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. I&#8217;m mainly assigned to escort Princess Rushia. I have never been in a battle before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: I guess the kraken incident is  May’s first battle but Ned stole that chance?) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Basically, in this battle, the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 will fight the Poisonous Demon Dragon. The coordination of these women, who work together on a daily basis, is extremely powerful. If May and I, who are outsiders, meddle with them, it will be even more of a nuisance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, May&#8217;s ability is by no means inferior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese even considered recruiting her to the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 at first sight. Therefore, I have told her that she can move freely as a ranger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The right-wing wall is thin. I&#8217;m going to join them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, please do so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May stepped on the ground hard and raced across the earth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The force present here is a total of 13 people from the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 plus May. The number of people who can be on hand for an attack is at most seven, as they are divided into two equal groups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The squads are replaced for the fourth time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was an opponent who had originally fought the coalition force. After all, the hastily created team did not have enough men, and the individual burden is heavy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May shouts as she parries the claws of the poisonous demon dragon that looms over her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure that Riese-sama will come?The members here alone are not strong enough, no matter how you look at it! We won&#8217;t stand a chance against this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, Riese&#8217;s legs will take her from Royal Capital to here in a matter of seconds.. She&#8217;ll be here before we&#8217;re wiped out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t underestimate the physical capabilities of a being of Existence Power Level 6.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she wanted to, she could run through a road that took three hours by horse-drawn carriage in less than ten minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why isn’t she here now!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered this question by glaring at the Poisonous Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because we have the&#8230;&#8230;trump card at the ready.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is right, we are not strong enough by any stretch of the imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before that, it was now or never the right time to move. Princess Rushia&#8217;s health was getting worse day by day. Even the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 don&#8217;t always have an open schedule. In order to prepare more forces, we need to spend more time, but we don&#8217;t know how Princess Rushia&#8217;s health will be at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m borrowing the carriage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What we lack in strength, we make up for in ingenuity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got on the coachman&#8217;s seat and drove the wind horse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t do it Ned! You can&#8217;t do this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can at least attract him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragons are intelligent monsters, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they all strive to be intelligent. It is the same with humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Poisonous Demon Dragons have abandoned their intelligence and use violence as their weapon of choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its attacks are all vicious, and the compensation is that the dragon lost his intelligence. This makes an opening that must be taken advantage of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright,&#8230;.come here, Poison Dragon&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The diversion is successful. But at the same time, my head is ringing alarm bells.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Poisonous Demon Dragon spits out a miasma from its mouth. A purple mist spreads over the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sharp pain in my eyeballs made me blind. I must leave this place immediately, but my vision is blurred and I cannot manoeuvre my horse properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, something fell on the coachman&#8217;s seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised by the shock as I suddenly felt someone was next to me, and when I opened my eyes&#8230;&#8230; it was a girl who is a member of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned—Husband, you are as reckless as ever!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: Ned Husband: </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ネットの旦那</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve never been reckless for the love of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also&#8230;&#8230;driving, I&#8217;ll take over!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl operated the wind horse with familiar movements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I recall, she is one of the most skilled horse handlers in the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』. She was also piloting the wind horse during this road trip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The golden eyes of the poison demon dragon reflected on us, as if it was unexpected that it had failed to finish me off with the miasma earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A huge arm was reared up to the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s thick claws almost hit the carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san, are you all right?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clang!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> A loud clang sounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the sound of a woman with long hair deflecting the approaching claws from below.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, I was saved.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you die, our leader will follow you! We won&#8217;t let you die!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s possible, but let&#8217;s not say anything now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The diversion was more successful than I had imagined. While the Poisonous Dragon is distracted by us, the remaining members of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 launch a simultaneous attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both of you, I&#8217;m fine now, so join the attack.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asking earnestly, the two girls gulped down their objections and headed towards the Poison Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They ran their wind horses to get behind the Poisonous Demon Dragon. The two girls, who had been watching the onslaught of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, were planning to diversion again if there was an opportunity and then something like a light was seen in the mouth cavity of the Poison Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ This is bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A special means of attack possessed by dragons. Dragons store enormous amounts of energy in their bodies, which they expel from their mouths to unleash high-powered, wide-range attacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poison demon dragon shoots purple rays of light at the knights in front of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a roaring roar, the beam of light pierces the crater walls. The walls protecting the royal city would be reduced to dust in an instant if it hit them directly. The ground was gouged, the atmosphere was blown away and the forests in the distance burst into flames.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights who received such a blow, although not unscathed, were unharmed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They lined up in front of those with the strongest presence and used their shields to forcefully divert the breath from its trajectory. The highest strength of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 is Riese, who has an Existence Power of 6, but the other members also have several existence powers of 5, so they can cope with the dragon&#8217;s breath depending on their ingenuity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of these women holding up their swords, covered in wounds, on the rough ground was heroic indeed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witnessing such a scene, I was reminded of a bitter memory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..How enviable.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be able to fight like that. To be able to hold a sword like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clenched my fist unconsciously and when I realised that blood was dripping from my palm, I clicked my tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Why am I remembering this now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately remembered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because last night, Lese told me one superfluous word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『You didn&#8217;t always aspire to be a hero, did you?』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those words ruminate in my brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be the hero that everyone envied. I wanted to carry people&#8217;s hope, defeat the Demon King who plunged the world into chaos and destroy him, and save humanity &#8211; the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how I came to think that way. It could have been a heroic tale I read as a child, or a bard&#8217;s song I heard at a tavern in town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just wanted to grab a sword and fight for someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to be a hero. I had such strong aspirations when I was a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230; reality is not so easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I aspired to be a hero, but soon afterwards I discovered that I had no talent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My physical abilities were below average. Compared to my peers, I had no stamina and no physical strength. My physique was also not excellent. In addition, I discovered that I had a constitution that made it difficult to increase my existence power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when asked about my intelligence, it was mediocre too. My groundwork was ordinary, I did not have the sense to devise unique tactics, and my memory was not that good unless I was interested in a subject. With a brain like that, it was difficult to learn magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ I have no talent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be a hero or not to be a hero. Before that&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t have the talent to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I decided to rely on someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how hard I try, I will never be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I knew I couldn&#8217;t be a hero &#8211; the only thing that wouldn&#8217;t go away was my desire to fight for someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, I approached strong people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without forgetting my respect and admiration for them, I continued to work together with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several years had passed since I gave up on the path of becoming a brave warrior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, people from all walks of life started to gather around me. I realised that if I gave up being a hero myself, life would work out reasonably well for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, about ten days ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that the adventuring party I had created was to be appointed as a heroic party in the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure that  somewhere in my heart, I had high hopes.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that even someone like me could become a hero.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m a halfwit to no end&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the battle between the knights and the poisonous demon dragon, I thought back to the time when I was expelled from the party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, I could have laid a lot of groundwork for His Majesty the King of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I didn&#8217;t dare to put down any roots ────.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be recognised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted them to say, [You&#8217;re a hero].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to be recognised as a hero, purely &#8230;.. and not as a twisted opinion based on profit and loss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuck&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel nauseated by my half-hearted way of life. I didn’t think I was ready to give up yet&#8230;..I want to punch my childish spirit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe it was&#8230;&#8230;harder than I thought it would be &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to admit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the expulsion of the heroes&#8217; party was, in its own way, painful for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that I had been acting so cheerfully up until now made my head feel heavy all at once when I realised this fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am weak. I know that without being told now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not just my body. I&#8217;m sure my heart is weak too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard May&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realised that the jaws of the Poison Demon Dragon were closing in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately manoeuvred the wind horse and avoided the poison demon dragon&#8217;s bite with a single paper stroke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just by moving the poison demon dragon, a blast of wind blows. The miasma was dispersed by that wind, and my skin complained of a burning pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, don&#8217;t be too reckless!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May swings her sword and blows away the miasma around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You &#8211; you can&#8217;t fight!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May shouts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a word that once again called up my resolve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;True.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, hang on a little longer! Riese will be here in a few minutes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I shouted, May confronted the Poisonous Demon Dragon with a fearless smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing their bravery, I feel at ease. I know they&#8217;re out of my league.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s fine to respect them. However, I must not deny myself now by comparison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The past, when I gave up being a hero, is heavy, but I am happy with the way I live now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since this way of life, my tiny beliefs have grown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was a child, I wanted to fight for someone— but not now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I have in this chest is a certain determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always live my life with the help of someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I ── I have to live for someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember a girl who was suffering in the face of an unreasonable fate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is my mission to offer her a helping hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-order your men to retreat immediately!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She glared at Riese, who stood in front of her. Rushia  could not understand at all how she could maintain such a calm attitude when Ned is now fighting the poison demon dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;ve fought one before, you&#8217;d know!　The Poisonous Demon Dragon is not an opponent you can win against!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why, after the defeat of the coalition forces, no one dared to challenge the Poison Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned wouldn&#8217;t stop…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells her in a calm voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once, that boy longed to be a hero, he failed and&#8230;. yet only his aspirations remained in his heart. He decided &#8230;&#8230; to save you. Until that is accomplished, he will not stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s eyes widened at Riese&#8217;s assurance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Her Highness&#8230;&#8230;is right, we won&#8217;t win as of now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Rushia could tell her,Riese interrupted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned is waiting. Someone has to come out of their shell and rush in&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia immediately guessed who Riese was referring to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Rushia clenches her fists and lowers her gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-but&#8230;..I–I, still&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, Rushia had accidentally looked in the mirror when she was suppressing a seizure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reflection in the mirror looked like a fearless monster. A true monster with the power of destruction in its body.  She was prepared to choose death herself rather than become such an ugly monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now her resolve begins to waver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By one man&#8217;s way of life, Ned’s&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Let&#8217;s talk a little about my old days.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Riese said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned once saved my family.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese continues with a nostalgic look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At the time, Ned had hired yet another adventurer, not me. My family was saved, and of course I felt grateful to Ned, but&#8230;&#8230;what bothered me even more was the expression on the face of the adventurer Ned had hired.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The expression &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese smiles at Rushia, who asks back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He looked very proud. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how an adventurer who was only&#8230;&#8230;employed could have such a look on his face.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if recounting a precious memory, Riese carefully spins her words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I started working with Ned for a while and&#8230;&#8230; came to understand how that adventurer felt. That&#8230;&#8230; man is always fighting for someone else. He is never strong, but he never wavers in his&#8230;..belief. That man has no power, but he knows how to use it better than anyone else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a somewhat proud expression, Riese says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I could have the strength, I would rather leave it to someone like him&#8230;&#8230;.Somewhere along the line, I came to believe that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230;&#8230;you follow Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Not only me, but surely all those who adore Ned are of the same mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned has a large number of friends. Riese does not know all of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Riese is sure it would be a lot of fun to meet them face to face. When someone is working with Ned, they&#8217;re sure to get along with new people and with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, Princess Rushia. Please, Believe in Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells Rushia seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, right in front of her, She has the frame of that someone. Riese made that clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will give you this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese hands a letter to Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is a letter that Ned wrote to Her Highness. In truth, it was only my job to give this to you, but the conversation has gone on a bit too long. &#8230;&#8230;It looks like he stayed up all night writing it, so if you can, please read it through to the end.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said this, Rushia turned on her heel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W–wait! Where are you going?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, to the battle. According to my schedule, it&#8217;s about time they needed me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..if I go now, will I make it in time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can make it in time. I&#8217;m fast&#8230;&#8230;But, I might lose to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese told her with a smile, and this time she left Princess Rushia without looking back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After receiving the letter,Rushia opened the door to the guest room she had given to Ned, which was located close by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia goes into the room and reads the letter that Ned left behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reads it with trepidation, wondering what on earth it says────.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Humanity&#8217;s strongest ranking (provisional edition)】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The letter she received from Riese contained a mysterious ranking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wondering what on earth the Ned had intended to give this to her, Rushia silently read the names on the ranking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nasse, Seven, Ryuzen and Lloyd&#8230;&#8230;are names she has heard of. They are all well-known candidates for the strongest of humanity. It is not surprising that they are listed at the top of this ranking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;mu”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the rankings dropped, more and more names gradually became unfamiliar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When trying to read through them at random, Russia notices that her name is marked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">52nd  Rushia Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia was positioned as the 52nd strongest person in the 【Humanity&#8217;s strongest ranking (provisional edition)】 made by Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ranking continued afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quick skim showed that it was ranked up to 100th.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning the page over, Ned’s message was clearly seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to understand the intention of the ranking, Rushia began to read the second page carefully.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So,Princess Rushia is now ranked 52nd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Congratulations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough to tell you anything, so I&#8217;ll explain them in order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry to send you a letter out of the blue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it would be easier to understand on paper than verbally, so I asked Riese to give you this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see, Princess Rushia is the 52nd strongest person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how great the power of the dragon within Princess Rushia is, you would be the 52nd highest. I didn&#8217;t know the details either, but apparently the dragon power you can get from the dragonisation disease can be guessed to some extent from the information about the pathogenic dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, this ranking is supervised by the Great Sage Merlin and Lucas, the King of Wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia has at least heard of them, haven’t you? They are two of the most knowledgeable people in the world, so it&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that this ranking is the best in the world &#8230;&#8230;As an aside, it seems that this is the first time these two have worked together on something. They say it&#8217;s [a historic collaboration]. Maybe it will be in tomorrow&#8217;s newspaper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now&#8230;&#8230;there is only one thing I want to tell you in this ranking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t get dragged by the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragonification disease is not an uncommon condition if you look at it from a broader perspective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are plenty of people in the world who can beat dragons with their bare hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As can be seen from the ranking, Princess Rushia is ranked 52nd at best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are 51 more people above you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You are not a monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are still real monsters in this world that you can&#8217;t even touch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You see what I mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means&#8230;&#8230;at least 51 people are not afraid of you at all.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;aa”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was there that Princess Rushia finally realised the intention of this ranking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She understood clearly what Ned was trying to tell her.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, I&#8217;m one of them, although I&#8217;m not in the ranking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have met 47 people out of the top 51 in the ranking. I&#8217;ve been involved with them, and to me, you, at 52nd place, are just like any other person around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was I frightened last night when I saw Princess Rushia&#8217;s dragonisation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wouldn&#8217;t be much afraid of you being a dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Then why not?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, at least there is one person here who is not afraid of your power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wouldn&#8217;t that be a reason for Princess Rushia to embrace your dragon powers?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re looking at this letter, it means I&#8217;ve probably already left the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I&#8217;m dying now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I die from this, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get what I deserve, but if &#8230;&#8230;Princess Rushia changes her mind, I&#8217;d love to have your help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s power could be used to save someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be happy if you could help me first, just to try things out.</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The letter ends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia read through to the last sentence and shuddered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Kuhuhu, fufufu&#8230;&#8230;!!!&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, she laughs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s the point of trying things out? What did Ned want her to help with?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before she knew it, their positions had been reversed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Russia had thought she was the one being helped, and then she found herself &#8230;&#8230; being asked to help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she guesses that&#8217;s how it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strange and ludicrous as it sounds, it is probably the way of life of a man called Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this world is a heroic tale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not a story about a hero called Ned who saves someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a story about the various heroes in this world who save Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, the chosen hero is&#8230;Princess Rushia Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s all there is to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is only one of many heroes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A man who can&#8217;t be a hero, but can make someone&#8230;.. a hero?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia remembers Riese&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia now fully understands what that means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely this is what the man always does.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a girl who has been affected by the dragonisation disease and is frightened by the power of the dragon that resides in her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time Rushia was chosen to be the hero. Maybe it was also Riese&#8217;s time. And before that, someone else was chosen as hero again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she stepped out onto the balcony, a breeze blew through the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a small exhale, Rushia put her hand on the power of the dragon inside her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of her was a stubborn shell. A shell created by none other than herself. She had always thought that what lay beyond was cold darkness, and so she had always remained inside the shell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But apparently it is not darkness that lies beyond the shell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is at least one man waiting for her beyond the shell. This fact pushed Rushia&#8217;s back gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe the other side of the shell is warmer than she had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s believe in &#8230;&#8230; the world that lies beyond.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body began to creak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragon scales covered her cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her limbs grew muscular, and sharp fangs sprouted between her teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s strange. She always felt pain when she turned into a dragon in a seizure, but when she turned into a dragon by her own will, She didn&#8217;t feel any pain at all. It is as if the two opposing elements within her have mesh together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-my,claws are &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Russia looks at the sharp claws on her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can these claws be a sword to save someone, not for destruction and violence?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My wings are…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Russia looks at the pure white wings reflected in the window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can these wings flap for someone who needs help, not to wreak carnage?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My strength is&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia felt the power of the dragon rising from deep within her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This power, can she use it to save someone?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Russia is not confident. That&#8217;s why she decided to entrust it to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She will let that man who believed in her.. decide what this power should be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After May and the knights had endured the breath of the poisonous demon dragon, something trembled inside my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get out of the carriage, stick my hand inside the pouch and take out a communication stone that reports an incoming call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this Riese?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aa. I gave the letter to His Highness.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. Then&#8230; use it immediately.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Understood』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short exchange, I approached the knights fighting the poison dragon and shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone, when I give the signal, keep your distance from the poisonous dragon!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my voice, the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 replied, [Okay!].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, what are you going to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who was resting her body nearby, asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that I can&#8217;t participate in the attack now because I&#8217;ve been exposed to the poisonous demon dragon&#8217;s miasma for a while.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese will come and hit it with a big move.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the strategy I had decided on with Riese beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese&#8217;s armament&#8230;..the Sword of Great Glory, has a special skill. If she uses it, she can inflict a lot of damage on the Poisonous Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t know there was such a thing&#8230;&#8230;but then why haven&#8217;t you used it before?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That skill is good for surprise attacks. I didn&#8217;t let Riese  join the fight until now in order to catch the Poisonous Demon Dragon by surprise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As powerful as that skill is, it tends to involve allies in group fights. That is why it did not seem to be usable in the first fight against the poison demon dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because it is also a dangerous skill, Riese does not use it without warning. As a result, even though the 《Sword of Glorious Radiance》 weapon became famous, the skill in the weapon was not well-known. When Riese uses this skill, it is usually when she is fighting in the outskirts of the human world, where no one is watching. Rumours rarely spread.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Poisonous Demon Dragons have also realised that we are all lower-ranked and have let its guard down nicely.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the release of the earlier breath, the poison demon dragon&#8217;s attacks had gradually become more consistent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poisoned dragon was looking down on us, who were already in a state of exhaustion and exhaustion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s about time&#8230;&#8230;please, Riese.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 were instructed to keep their distance from the poisonous dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds later it seemed as if the sky in the direction of Royal Capital lit up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing her communication with Ned, Riese  drew the 《Sword of Glorious Radiance》 from its scabbard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using her physical strength of existence 6 to the limit, she headed towards the nest of the poisonous demon dragon. The speed of the sword was more than ten times faster than a wind horse, and it could pass through the forest in just a few seconds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O Sword of Glorious Radiance&#8217;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese chanted as she ran</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The special armament 《Sword of Glorious Radiance》, which is the symbol of Riese, has two characteristics. What she is about to use is the second characteristic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Wearing the light that guides all things.》 《Be a spear through the foundations.》 —”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dazzling light covers the sword and its shape changes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade becomes longer and thicker, and the handle feels like a hard stick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What appeared was a spear of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese throws it with all her might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill release —《Spear of the Great Radiant 》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, the sky in the direction of the Royal Capital seemed to light up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A huge spear of light pierced the body of the Poison Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A violent impact and a resounding roar. And then the poison demon dragon screams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant purple body collapsed to the ground. A strong earth tremor was heard and a crack ran through the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-did it work &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aaa. The surprise attack was successful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the somewhat expectant May, I say without letting my guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if you&#8217;re dealing with a Poison Demon Dragon, &#8230;&#8230;even with this attack, it only makes a light injury.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poison demon dragon emitted a roar and a large amount of miasma overflowed from its mouth and the atmosphere turned purple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt that a great deal of damage was inflicted. However, it was not a fatal wound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Poisonous Demon Dragon was not letting its guard down after such an attack. The poison demon dragon recognised us as its enemy and was wielding a strong killing intent along with the miasma. Its golden twin eyes glared at us. We felt a strong pressure and our hearts were almost crushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spear of light released byRiese  is still stuck in the body of the poison demon dragon. The poison dragon is unable to move thanks to this, but it will not be able to keep it up forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is such a&#8230;&#8230; trump card not going to work&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s face paled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By trump card, she probably means what I told her as soon as the fight started.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not that this is a trump card, but &#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s about time, it&#8217;s really not good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m nearing the limit of buying time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who has used her big move, shouldn&#8217;t be able to move for a while. Until she arrives, we have no choice but to endure with the forces present here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poison demon dragon, pierced by the spear of light, spread its jaws wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A purple phosphorescent glow can be seen at the back of the oral cavity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">—A second breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think we can stand it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blowing out cold sweat, I look at my friends around me. Both May and the adventurers of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 had a feeling of resignation on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All is lost. Such words pass through their heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just before the poison demon dragon&#8217;s oral cavity glowed strongly and purple rays of light were released -.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A silvery white light poured down from the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silvery white light crushes the poison demon dragon and prevents it from breathing a second time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This attack is even more powerful than Riese&#8217;s skill. Multiple cracks run through the tough scales that cover the body of the Poison Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took me a little while to understand what had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A huge shadow descends upon us, dazzling us with its intense power and brilliance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a beautiful dragon covered in silvery white scales.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-dragon &#8230;&#8230;!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it get here&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurers are surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people of the Kingdom of Enuvidia are said to believe in dragons, but this is a quintessential situation. There is too much fear that, like the poisonous demon dragons, they may be the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem!! That dragon is on our side!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me, May&#8217;s eyes widened as if she had guessed what was going on&#8230;&#8230;.She must have noticed. She and I recognised the claws and wings of the dragon that had landed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must be Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;yes it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silvery white dragon replies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice that shook the air, that echoed deep in the pit of my stomach, was unmistakably Rushia&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re too late. We almost died.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;.. You knew all along, didn&#8217;t you? That I would come here?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a smile, I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know&#8230; I&#8217;m a good judge of people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, staring into the crimson eyes of the silver-white dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a terrifying pressure. Her presence is no less than that of a poisonous demon dragon. But&#8230;&#8230;I know she is unmistakably human. Until a short time ago, she was afraid of the power of the dragon inside her, and only now she is a girl who has broken through the shell and appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no reason to fear her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia Enuvidia is on our side</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Kufu &#8230; Fuhahahahaha !!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dragon laughs and the atmosphere shook with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poison demon dragon does not move. It seems to be wary of her &#8211; the silvery white dragon Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Net. Wait a little longer.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With somewhat reassuring eyes, Rushia looks at me and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I will save you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Rushia told me, she spread her wings wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia called herself a monster, but she didn&#8217;t look like one. Her silver-white scales reflecting the sunlight were reminiscent of soft first snow, and her beautiful crimson eyes lit up with intelligence and pride, unlike those of a poisonous demon dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragons are virtuous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can understand why the people of the Kingdom of Enuvidia believe in dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s oral cavity glows dazzlingly. She also seems going to use her breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Poisonous Demon Dragon, heavily injured, also stores light in its oral cavity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, the two dragons release their breath at the same time but the victory goes to the silvery-white dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blinding ray of light pushes away the purple breath and swallows the body of the Poison Demon Dragon. The Poison Demon Dragon was blown to the crater on the other side and collapsed with a loud bang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s breath is maintained. Witnessing its power, I involuntarily muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May and the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 were also astonished. I didn&#8217;t expect Lucilla to be this strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not surprising&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dragon power obtained from the dragonisation disease grows as the disease progresses, eventually reaching the same or greater strength as the pathogenic dragon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strength of Rushia, whose dragonisation disease had progressed to its limit, had already reached one step short of that of a poisonous demon dragon. That is to say &#8211; it is as close as possible to being strong enough to defeat the coalition forces on her own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice calls out to me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn around and there&#8217;s Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese. I&#8217;m sorry to have you come in a hurry&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I know it when I see it. I guess I&#8217;m out of the picture..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flash of white silver was finally over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fallen Poison Demon Dragon did not even twitch. Even though Riese&#8217;s skill had dealt a heavy blow, I didn&#8217;t think it would be so easily settled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the fallen down Poisonous Demon Dragon, the silver dragon was standing calmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in dragon form, Rushia still exudes the dignity of royalty. She does not seem intimidated by May or the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her white scales reflect the sunlight and shine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dragon shining on the battlefield is reminiscent of a hero from a fairy tale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;is amazing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her power is not frightening. As long as it is used correctly, it can be a light of salvation for people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel envy and longing &#8211; the usual emotions for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a hero. But strangely enough, this is the only sight I&#8217;ve always loved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Welcome, new hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I admire you from the bottom of my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the poisonous demon dragon had died.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the trail of destruction spread out before me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s breath was as powerful as the poison demon dragon&#8217;s breath. Even though the Poison Demon Dragon was wounded, I never thought she would overturn the situation in one fell swoop. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; If it was just based on pure firepower alone, I&#8217;d put her in the top ten.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would have prided myself on having a reasonable number of occasions to do this, but I rarely see attacks of this power. It probably falls in the top tier of dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose you should thank me for helping to persuade her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese said, somewhat good-naturedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you say persuaded, you just gave her the letter I wrote, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, Why did you just look away? You didn&#8217;t say anything extra, did you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu……Who knows…fufufu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese gave a meaningful smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Risese probably has talked about unnecessary things. I hope she’s not talking about the old me or something&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice that came out of her stomach calls to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look and see Riese, who has turned into a dragon, slowly approaching me with loud footsteps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s finished. How are you feeling?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『How are you feeling?&#8230;..fu,fufufu,&#8230;feeling?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To which I replied, [Hmm?] as I tilted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, there was something wrong with her. While I was worrying about her, thinking that something had gone wrong, Rushia deactivated her dragonisation right in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A silver-haired girl appears in a state of undress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s body trembled at the traces of destruction that spread out before her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“oooO?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ongyaahahahhhhh! That was scary!　I was scared, Neddddddddoooooooo!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia ran to me at full speed and hugged me tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was more than a little upset that I was being held naked, but&#8230;..before that, it hurt. My rib bones were screaming. Despite her slender physique, Rushia&#8217;s muscular strength is very strong. Is she still under the influence of dragonisation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo,ooo…that was scary. You&#8217;re okay now&#8230;..It&#8217;s okay, just step away&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the end, I still can&#8217;t fight!　I won&#8217;t do it again!　I will never fight againaaaaaaaaaaaaaaーーー!!！”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was fading in and out of consciousness from the intense pain, I agreed with Rushia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aaa&#8230;&#8230; I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that might be the case, but&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, Rushia  had distanced herself from fighting and conflict because of her fear that she would end up like the Poisonous Demon Dragon. That&#8217;s what she really meant when she said, [I hate fighting.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as a result of keeping her distance from fighting in this way, &#8230;..Rushia  may have become afraid of fighting, even in the purest sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this has nothing to do with the power of the dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nor is it tied to an unreasonable fate. It&#8217;s simply about &#8230;..hobbies and interests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Ned. I&#8217;m glad you were able to defeat the Poisonous Demon Dragon, but look at&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May calls out in a reserved manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, this would have been a situation where a battle cry of victory could have been raised. However, beyond May&#8217;s gaze &#8211; in the vicinity of the silent Poisonous Demon Dragon on the rim of the crater,something unusual was happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large amount of poison is overflowing from the corpse of the poison demon dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Purple bodily fluids were dripping from the gaps between the tattered and crumbling scales. Centred on the poisonous dragon, the ground is quickly turning a poisonous colour, and at this rate, the area where we are will be eroded in a few minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I guess I didn&#8217;t think much of the clean-up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is still a dragon with a nasty poison despite being dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we flee using the wind horses, we will not be caught up in the poisonous erosion&#8230;&#8230;but, If we leave it like this, the whole area of land around it will become unusable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia. Can&#8217;t you use your breath again?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;. Honestly I can’t even stand still anymore”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia’s power it&#8217;s that powerful. It was to be expected that it would be very draining.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The quickest way to do this is to use a high-powered attack to obliterate the poison demon dragon&#8217;s corpse itself. However, Rushia can no longer use her breath, and Riese&#8217;s Sword skill is slightly underpowered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should I do&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I racked my brains, I felt the communication stone was shaking in my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who was communicating at this time? Curious, I immediately answered it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh~!　It&#8217;s been a long time, Ned!　Finally, the connection is established!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice belonged to a man who had travelled with me not so long ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lloyd?&#8230;.It&#8217;s been a long time. I thought they&#8217;d taken your comms stone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh yeah, they took it away!　So I bought it back!　The knight who went in there instead of the net, called Yuri&#8230;&#8230; something, stopped me, but I tied him up properly, so I&#8217;m good to go now!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yuri-something’ now seems to be stuck in place by him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have thought for some time that the biggest victim in this case might be that ‘Yuri–something’.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re in the middle of a journey to defeat the Demon King, aren&#8217;t you? What&#8217;s the problem?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No, wasn&#8217;t it you who had a problem?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Liz was making a lot of fuss about how her [self-defence garment] she put on Ned was deactivated~.We thought the net might be in danger, so we hurriedly prepared a communication stone.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s how it happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad you feel that way, but it&#8217;s a bit late. I&#8217;ve already sorted it out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ehh, really?　I just looked at it with my Hawk-Eye and saw a purple lizard running wild, so I shot it with a big one.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trying to understand Lloyd&#8217;s words, I stop thinking for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment ─ ─ a golden slash flew in from out of nowhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an ear-splitting explosion, a crescent-shaped slash obliterated the corpse of the poison demon dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was no less powerful than Rushia&#8217;s breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the slash disappeared, there was no trace of the dead body of the poison demon dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While everyone is stunned, the man makes a happy noise over the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ooo, judging that sound, it seems to have reached you!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-aah&#8230;&#8230;just arrived&#8230;&#8230;As it turns out, you really helped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well, then I guess we&#8217;re all good then!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They say all&#8217;s well that ends well, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he can&#8217;t think about the process. When I say this, this man ‘Llyod’ doesn&#8217;t listen. I know this all too well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ahh—it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve had this feeling! The one where we communicate with each other and beat the shit out of the enemy!『Stardust Light』 is great, but sometimes we should venture out with other members too!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..if you feel up to it. I&#8217;m going to be busy for a while, so I&#8217;m going to hang up now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oou!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I disconnect the communication with my former adventuring companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, Rushia and the others were still stunned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;&#8230;well, it looks like someone I know cleaned up after them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell them in the awkward air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned…..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said with a twitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did I work hard….?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course she did &#8211; I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the face of this scene, I couldn&#8217;t say no.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king of the Kingdom of Intail is holding his head in his office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He stared at the pile of papers on his desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was carried by the Prime Minister this morning. He didn’t have to read it to know what it contained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reparations&#8230;&#8230;reparations, a lot of reparations &#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them are documents relating to reparations for the heroic party&#8217;s outburst. No matter how much they processed, the next day the same amount of documents would be delivered again. The king was lightly neurotic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a knock at the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king braced himself to think that the Prime Minister had come to report another incident about the hero party, he had already heard about today&#8217;s accident. There will be no more terrible stories. In a way, that&#8217;s a relief. He quickly regained my composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened and the one who entered was, as expected, the Prime Minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty. Diplomat Emma requests an audience.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An audience? What&#8217;s the purpose?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She wants to talk to you about Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the king heard the name of the person he hated, he almost broke the pen in his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the king is in a difficult situation. He decided that if there is any chance of getting any good news regarding the treatment of the hero party, he should listen to what the diplomat has to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let her&#8230;&#8230;through.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister nodded and opened the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Diplomat Emma enters the room. She was a bright, clear-faced woman with light red hair tied back in a single bun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s been a long time, Your Majesty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. What can I do for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king asks Emma, who bows her head, simply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister knew more about Emma. The king did not know much about her. As he recalled, she had been sent to the eastern continent&#8230;&#8230;.The king didn&#8217;t understand why she wanted to talk about Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty. Is it true that you expelled Ned from the Hero Party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. The&#8230;&#8230;Hero Party is the face of the state. We can&#8217;t leave it in the hands of a man like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king tells him as a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Emma let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a stupid thing&#8230;&#8230;to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I–idiot!? What did you just say about me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said an idiot”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It outrage the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Emma did not shrivel up,she put her hand to her forehead and looked distressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty. Do you know the adventuring party to which Ned used to belong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The 『Stardust Light』, right? I know that much!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what about his predecessor parties?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;predecessor?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was information he didn&#8217;t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king&#8217;s brow wrinkles, and Emma begins to speak with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There was once a party of adventurers who were said to be the strongest in history.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king shuts his mouth and Emma continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are only seven members&#8230;..five of whom remain unidentified. They suddenly disbanded and disappeared from the world&#8217;s attention. &#8230;&#8230; But still, their names are strongly etched in people&#8217;s memories.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;D-don’t tell me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strongest adventurer party in history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It consists of seven members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With those two pieces of information, anyone could get the answer. From the king of a country to a village girl in the middle of nowhere, men, women and children of all ages knew about the adventuring party. There is only one party in history that boasts such tremendous fame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The Seven Meteors』&#8230;&#8230;Ned is their leader. His second name is&#8230; 『The Illusion King』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emma tells the king plainly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this explanation, the king got up from his chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Id-ido&#8230;..you idiot! Impossible!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know all about the 『The Seven Meteors』!　『The Illusion King』 was supposed to be an all-round master of all martial arts and magic!　That identity is Ned?!&#8230;&#8230;Nonsense!　How can such a weak man be the 『The Illusion King』!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the king&#8217;s words, the prime minister, who had remained silent,shook his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For all intents and purposes, Ned is not connected to information about the  『The Illusion King』. However —.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The Illusion King』 is also the name of a frame.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F-frame &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When the 『The Seven Meteors』 is active, the leader of the group, Ned, calls in one collaborator who is suited to the purpose each time. That collaborator acts under the name 『The Illusion King』&#8230;&#8230;In other words, the 『The Illusion King』 refers to the very framework of external collaborators that Ned has. Some of the cases, Ned himself took part in the adventure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a laughable opinion that was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it makes sense. 『The Illusion King』 is an all-round master of all abilities. Each skill he possesses is so refined that a person would have to spend a lifetime to acquire it. If it were said that his true identity is a collection of several masters, it would make sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that the owner of the frame is, of all people, Ned Wolkinter&#8230;&#8230; is hard to accept.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that man is the 『The Illusion King』&#8230;&#8230;why didn&#8217;t he tell me?　If he had told me that name from the start, I wouldn&#8217;t have had to send him away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are circumstances. He probably won&#8217;t reveal himself again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emma gives a puzzling answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then why do you, &#8230;&#8230;a mere diplomat, know his identity?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I happened to come face to face with Ned, who works as the  『The Illusion King』, at my dispatch office. I&#8217;ve been a fan of his ever since then&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emma said somewhat happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, however, she braced herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I&#8217;m a&#8230;&#8230;fan, I&#8217;ve been very careful and tight-lipped about him until now. But it&#8217;s not the case any more, and &#8230;..or my confiding in him at this time may be just what he expects&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latter part is muttered in a small voice, as if talking to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the king sees the light in Emma&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he&#8217;s hiding his true identity and the king knows it, doesn&#8217;t that mean he has a weakness on him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, that could be used as a bargaining chip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king tries to hide his smile. But Emma saw through his thoughts and told him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one will believe you if you tell them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a sharp point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It certainly is. Even the king still find it hard to believe, but when Emma says that&#8230;&#8230;Ned&#8217;s true identity is the 『The Illusion King』, who in the world is going to believe him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Information that Ned is the  『The Illusion King』 is not material for blackmail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king made up his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou, is that man really the&#8230;&#8230;『The Illusion King』?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king asked Emma in a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, he is. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t be able to control a hero party full of problems and act like a child.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emma told the king plainly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king&#8217;s forehead was covered in greasy sweat. His stomach churned with pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Prime Minister.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y–yes sir?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Withdraw our request to defeat the Poison Dragon&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king shouted at the Prime Minister, who voiced his doubts, as if to vent his anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Call the king of Enuvidia!　Immediately withdraw the matter of the Poisonous Demon Dragon!　And promptly send a letter of apology to Ned!　Our&#8230;&#8230; opponent is that 『The Illusion King』. We must hold him at all costs!　We can&#8217;t just hand him over to another country!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the case of the Poisonous Demon Dragon, Ned must have realised the fact that it is being targeted by the Intail Kingdom. First of all, the king must immediately dispel that impression. He must apologise with all his might and be prepared to hand over large sums of money if necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the unlikely event that they succeed in defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon!　We&#8217;ll finally have no excuse! Let&#8217;s call it a mistake, but at any rate, cover up the fact that we were after Ned&#8217;s life!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing the king&#8217;s cries, Emma&#8217;s face is stained with disappointment: [Did you even do that?] But now the king can&#8217;t afford to care about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there are casualties in the fight against the Poisonous Demon Dragon, Ned will undoubtedly disgust towards the Intail Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there are still a few days left until the one-week deadline for defeating the dragon. Normally, to fight an enemy the size of the Poisonous Demon Dragon, they would normally spend time preparing until the very last minute before the deadline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps the fight hasn&#8217;t started yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there should be time to have a conversation somehow. The king tried to think so, but──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──No, it was different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king realised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if, by any chance, Ned succeeded in defeating the poisonous demon dragon?　─ Such nonsense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The opponent is that 『The Illusion King』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strongest adventurer party, 『The Seven Meteors』. For the man who was the leader of that group, defeating the poisonous demon dragon was surely not just a matter of chance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Sh, excuse me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a knock, the door opens and one of the bureaucrats working in the castle enters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man tells the king, who has a bad feeling about this, with a nervous look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a report to make. It seems that a poisonous demon dragon is finally defeated in the Kingdom of Enuvidia…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s like a signal that divides the source.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is as if the arm that was outstretched to hold Ned was lightly brushed aside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king now understood that he was completely cut off from Ned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having received the unacceptable report, the king abandons his thoughts for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, having somehow accepted reality, the king made up his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. disband the hero party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a trembling voice, the king announced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence reigns in the room as the king opens his mouth wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Disband the heroic party!　Our country withdraws from defeating the Demon King!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king shouted with all his might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was undoubtedly a declaration of defeat.</span></p>
