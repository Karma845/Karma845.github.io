<h3>Chapter 4 - Calling for Help.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day of the final examinations. The students had assembled in front of the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well,  the final exam for the selection of the hero party is finally here.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said as she checked the faces of those who had gathered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Before we start the exam, I have one unfortunate piece of news. For&#8230;.various reasons, Rigil&#8217;s party has withdrawn from the exam. This leaves six remaining parties.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No wonder they haven&#8217;t turned up any time soon.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why did they withdraw at this time?&#8230;..The most likely reason is that they were scared off by the final exam and turned tail. The next most likely reason is some kind of trouble.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『As you know, the final examinations are extremely dangerous. But I do not want you to die. Therefore, you must share the necessary information before the examination begins!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s words made the candidates ready themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was no time to be thinking about the whereabouts of the party that had dropped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『In the lairs of the dead dragon live special monsters that have adapted to the power of corrosion!　And the most troublesome of these monsters is that they seem to have eaten the carcasses of the dead dragon! At the moment, two types of monster have been identified!　One is a mutant of the monster called King Ape!　The other is a mutant of a monster called the Garuda, an extinct bird!　The strength of these two monsters corresponds to an existence power of 6 in human terms!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A rustle and a groan can be heard amongst the candidates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Existence power 6 &#8211; there is not a single examinee who has reached that level. In other words, there seems to be a monster in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest that is more powerful than any of the competitors who fought at the Valour Festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『And one more thing!　The 《Dragon Crown Sword》 is located in the centre of the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair!This weapon, which possesses special powers, cannot be touched by monsters, so it will not shift position until someone else gets it!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said that special armaments made from monster materials contain the presence of the monster from which they were made. The presence of the Dragon Crown Sword may be what is keeping the monsters away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You have done well to survive this long, my fierce men and women. Your struggle has already been recognised by many of the people&#8230;.But only one party will win in the end. The mistress must choose one of you.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia tells the candidate with determined eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Please, please. I sincerely hope that a real hero will emerge from among you &#8211; a new hero who can become the hope of this country!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia declared in a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Achieve greatness! Let the final test begin!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after the signal sounded, several parties stepped into the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and the others also entered the forest. Unlike the Valour Festival, this time each party is competing for the results of the test. After each party entered the forest, they went their separate ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The trees in the forest, nearly half of them are stained white. &#8230;&#8230; Is this the power of the abandoned dragon?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short while of walking, Phylicia looked around and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trees in the forest were dotted with trees of the usual shades of green and brown, and trees with white trunks and leaves, affected by corrosion, as if they were speckled with spots. The white trunks of the trees crumbled when lightly impacted, and the leaves shattered and fell to the ground at the foot of the trees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The white particles on the ground are not sand, but the debris of trees shattered by corrosion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair is a vast forest, but it won&#8217;t take long to find it&#8230;as long as we know where the 《Dragon Crown Sword》=&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch mutters. In other words, this test is not a race against time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing to be wary of is the monsters. Each person should be ready to fight at any time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Alice looked at Exzair with only her gaze.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Exzair Sullivan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is the man whom Alice met in the Amdo Empire and in this selection test for the heroic party, ordered to be the winner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair  knew what Alice was capable of and wondered if she could be used. The result was using the hostage to blackmail Alice. Exzair&#8217;s special armoury, the 《Void Sky》, has the effect of moving through space at will. Unbound by the concept of distance, Exzair could kill Alice&#8217;s parents, who lived far away from her, at any time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair stops and tells his party member sharply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a monster.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tiger-like monster stared at them from among the trees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair&#8217;s aim was to become a member of the heroic party of the Kingdom of Enuvidia and to steal the kingdom&#8217;s amoury and information. For this reason, his interests were aligned with Alice&#8217;s only on one point: to pass the examination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, ostensibly, they take a cooperative attitude to the exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much, Exzair–san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.thank you for your help.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch, who know nothing about the situation, thank him honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who knew the true nature of Exzair, looked bitter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because during the Valour Festival I left&#8230;.most  fighting entirely to Alice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch grabs the axe on his back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave this to us&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Kirch ran towards the monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tiger-shaped monster was covered in a grey outer shell, perhaps affected by the corrosive force released by the carcass of a dead dragon. It looked hard to the naked eye, but Kirch had no hesitation in closing in on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《The Axe of Execution》”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(──《成敗斧》)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s special armaments explode in bursts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The harder the opponent, the more powerful the attack. That&#8217;s the effect of the 《The Axe of Execution》. The great axe swings down, gouging out the monster&#8217;s outer shell and knocking its body to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the monster was still alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“An ordinary monster would have sunk now, but&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monster stood up and approached Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, an arrow pierced the monster&#8217;s back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right next to Alice, Phylicia was holding her bow. A purple smoke enveloped her left eye.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia fires a second shot. The arrow pierced the monster&#8217;s flesh, which had been exposed by Kirch&#8217;s destruction of its outer shell. The arrowhead sinks deeply into the flesh and the monster lets out a cry of distress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Phylicia&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230; if only I didn&#8217;t have the curse, I could have finished it off with one shot&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch slams his axe into the monster again, killing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monster&#8217;s body lies on the ground. They waited for a while to see if it was still alive, but it was completely dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.it’s strong.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Yes. It seems that the monsters in this forest is harder than normal, although they are not the two mutant species that Princess Rushia mentioned&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, the power of corrosion was rampant in this forest. Monsters that could withstand this force began to live in the forest. In other words, many of the monsters here are probably robust individuals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after they are about to move── </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hyun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, a sound of the wind cutting through the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s eyes widen and he turns his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dull, dark-coloured knife grazed Kirch&#8217;s cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch–san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. it&#8217;s alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch wipes the blood dripping from his cheek with the back of his hand.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Four men and women in green cloaks emerge from the depths of the blackened forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them. The dark-haired man in the lead is holding a knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Green Shadow, Husen &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s voice trembled at the sudden appearance of the examinees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why, why did you attack us&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? &#8230;.. That&#8217;s a foolish question.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen smiles wryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hostility between parties is not forbidden.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite that, Husen&#8217;s party gets ready for battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Essentially, this environment is my battlefield. The humiliation of not being able to do anything in the second exam &#8211; I&#8217;m going to pay back here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, Husen&#8217;s party dispersed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen approaches Kirch. The other three headed towards Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch–san, be careful!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem &#8230;&#8230; if they come at me from the front, I won&#8217;t lose..”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, with his axe at the ready, suddenly dropped one of his knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then his limbs trembled slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230; poison &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen grins and dives into Kirch&#8217;s blindside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dull knife is thrust into Kirch&#8217;s chest. But just before it does, a black mist appears at Husen&#8217;s side, and Exzair appears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair launches a stabbing attack with a long, thin dagger. Husen avoided hair breath. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oya, that was close.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen clicks his tongue and jumps back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch–san, I&#8217;m treating you now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wary of the retreating Husen, Phylicia approached the crouching Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia&#8217;s right hand glows faintly, revealing a silver bottle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Balance of Purification and Healing.》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the cups on either side lights up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The numbness was removed from Kirch&#8217;s entire body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The special armament 《Balance of Purification and Healing.》 has two effects: detoxification and recovery. However, there is a limit to the amount of this armament that can be effective in a day. The amount is shared between detoxification and recovery, so the user must choose carefully whether to prioritise detoxification or recovery, depending on the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After detoxifying, Phylicia also healed the wound on Kirch&#8217;s cheek. A wound of this level can be healed without much effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spatial travel, detoxification and recovery&#8230;.You guys have some nice special armaments.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. your knives are also a special armament.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen glares at her with his eyes flashing and Phylicia says back, revealing her wariness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen plays with the knives in his hands. Then the number of knives increased to two or three.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《The Eroding Mountain Blade》  &#8230;&#8230; is an armament that produces an infinite number of poisoned knives. It&#8217;s not a remarkable effect, but I like the fact that it&#8217;s infinite. In a survival situation, the amount of weaponry left is a lifeline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">《蝕む山刃》</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Husen throws the knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knives are poisonous, so they have no choice but to concentrate on evading them, even if it drains their strength. Moreover, if the number of knives is unlimited, simply waiting for it to deplete is also not an option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M,Me too…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Phylicia and her friends, who had no choice but to take a defensive stance, Alice reached for her scabbard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, Husen&#8217;s party slashed at Alice with a knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waa, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m fine, but &#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice avoids the approaching knife. But she is constantly surrounded by three people, so she is unable to move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen laughs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have my friends trying to stop Alice Feldrant in her tracks. I don&#8217;t think we can beat that girl in a straight fight from the start. But If all of her &#8230;&#8230; friends retire, she will probably waver a little. From the looks of it, unlike Seren Duvalis, she&#8217;s mentally immature.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen&#8217;s words made Phylicia look grim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was already in a state where she could not remain calm. Even if the enemy has Existence Force 5, her mental structure was completely different from that of Seren, who had faced the test alone from the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then &#8230;&#8230; you intend to take on the three of us all by yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch says, re-setting his axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen&#8217;s party is made up of four people. If three of them are assigned to Alice, Husen will have to fight Phylicia and the other two by himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kirch tells him implicitly not to be overconfident, Husen snickers, [Hmph].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you.──this environment is my battlefield.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, Husen flies backwards, hiding his figure in the darkness of the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few seconds later, a dull-coloured knife was released at Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kh&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kirch evades the knife, it now closes in on Phylicia&#8217;s back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phylicia, bend over!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E?&#8230;&#8230; Kya!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Exzair&#8217;s instruction, Phylicia noticed the approaching knife and complied with a scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knife then flew at Exzair&#8217;s leg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tsk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair revealed his irritation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poster child for survival &#8211; Husen the Green Shadow. For a man who has lived as a hunter in a magical forest where vicious monsters are continuously regrouping, this environment must surely be easy for him to fight in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dark green cloak Husen wears is the protective colour of the forest, making it difficult for him to be seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Invisible. That simple word fear hung over Alice&#8217;s party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fear slowed her body and accelerated her physical exhaustion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia, who was trying to catch her disordered breath, lost her concentration for a moment. A moment later, Husen throws a knife without missing the opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before the dull knife pierces Phylicia&#8217;s body -.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sword blade extended from somewhere flicked Husen&#8217;s knife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blade shrank. Immediately afterwards, a man with red hair stood in front of Husen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If hostility between candidates is possible, then cooperation between&#8230;..candidates is also possible, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Red-haired, Alex&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen&#8217;s face contorted abominably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A little later, Alex&#8217;s friends were also approaching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Husen, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8230;&#8230;We&#8217;ve just heard about the dangers of this forest, haven&#8217;t we? I don&#8217;t think this is the time for parties to be fighting amongst ourselves.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. don&#8217;t be so conceited.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen told them without relaxing his stance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only one party will be chosen for the hero party&#8230;.The struggle between the candidates is still going on. Or did you enter this examination with that level of determination?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex wrinkles his eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He offers a hand for dialogue, but Husen quickly shakes it off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just that the number of parties we have to defeat here has gone from one to two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen shows his wariness, glares at Alec and the others, and disappears again into the depths of the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before that, however, Husen slipped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before he knew it, Husen&#8217;s feet had turned into a shallow swamp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, that&#8217;s-”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen glared at Rygan, one of Alex&#8217;s companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A magical tool to till the soil and a magical tool to create water&#8230;&#8230; I see,so this guy can certainly be used..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Rygan&#8217;s hands were two magical tools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were the ones used by the grimoire scholar Heisen at the second round of the Valour Festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small hoe and a watering can. These disproportionate-looking magical tools on the battlefield successfully robbed Husen of his mobility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, you, you &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen&#8217;s forehead was covered in blue streaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this, Alex approaches Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, yes&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice reacted by shaking her shoulders, as if she were a small animal surrounded by natural enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Alex, who knows what Alice is capable of, finds it hard to believe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but could you help us a little? These guys don&#8217;t seem to want to back down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, it must be a proposal to defeat Husen and his friends together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice could not answer immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later &#8211; she feels intense pressure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, Alex and Husen all realised the pressure and changed their expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something comes from deep in the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What came out from behind the deep darkness was a large tree flying at the speed of an arrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flying tree snatched Husen&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huzen was blown away with a pain as if half his body had been gouged out by a cannon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Goaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa───!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An ear-splitting roar echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A great big grey ape emerged from the darkness of the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The King Ape&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a giant ape in a cracked armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nearly half of his body hair has mutated and become hard as stone, probably due to the effects of eating the carcass of the abandoned dragon. Its eyes are bloodshot and show no sign of reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The  King Ape thrust its sharp claws into the rock and the rock then slowly turned to dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king ape had inherited the power of the abandoned dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oiou, it found us too quickly…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Rygan, who muttered with a twitchy expression on his face, Alex chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enemies are so densely packed in here. It is a sure thing he would be coming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From King Ape’s perspective, they are an alien threat to his territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rygan, hold him back!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under Alex&#8217;s direction, Rygan creates a shallow swamp at the feet of the crippled monkey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when the crippled ape entered the swamp &#8211; a sound like the evaporation of water was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The swamp turned into dust&#8230;.!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The muddy water has turned to dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is no way to slow it down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Husen, you&#8217;re being targeted!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn i──!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen became agitated at the cries of his companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crippled ape approached Husen at a speed not befitting its huge frame. A thick, muscular, powerful arm swung out. Huzen prepared himself for death at that moment, but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Snow Origin》.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a clink, the sound of water was heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gaaaaaaaaaa ── !?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King Ape shouts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s sword had sunk deep into King Ape&#8217;s arm. Alice immediately draws her sword and turns her slender frame to escape from the range of King Ape&#8217;s attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This way, this way&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice pulled Husen&#8217;s hand and evacuated him far away from the crippled ape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;why did you help me&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen looked at Alice with stunned, incredulous eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Alice had already turned to face the King Ape and the next moment, she was sprinting again.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘My body, light&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely, Alice felt that her physical body was lighter than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. More precisely, her mind was lighter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice remembers a few days ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;ll take care of Alice&#8217;s parents, my friends, everything.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those were the words of one young man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『So Alice, in your next final exam, do what you think is right.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, Alice had intended to do that without anyone telling her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was the first time she had been told so clearly and had her back pushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Much lighter in mind and body than at the Festival of Valour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O, Oioi!! Calm down! The opponent is a monster with an existence power equivalent to six! I need you to calm down here..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> She ignores Alex, who is bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With unprecedented concentration, Alice confronted the King Ape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shhhh…!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Avoiding the swinging arm, Alice swung her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her family and friends held hostage, Alice&#8217;s psyche was by no means normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, talking to Ned calmed her down even if it&#8217;s  just a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin》&#8230;&#8230;.!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King Ape crossed his arms in front of his chest and tried to guard against Alice&#8217;s attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Alice&#8217;s slash bent limply immediately after touching King Ape&#8217;s arm, splitting the King Ape&#8217;s huge body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The effect of the special armoury 《Snow Origin》is that it can liquefy a slash at will the moment it touches an object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if Alice&#8217;s slashes were transformed like snow that melts on contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.It’s unbelievable”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex was aghast at the sight before him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The threat of the King Ape was equivalent to an existence force of 6. Despite this, Alice, who was supposed to be at Existence Power 5, was still able to go toe-to-toe with the King Ape. It was not even close to an equal match but she had the upper hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, you are&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia opened her eyes and looked at Alice&#8217;s courageous figure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Husen analysed, Alice is mentally immature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s the flip side of the coin &#8211; her change in mentality affects her strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had shrunk both mentally and physically as a result of the threat from Exzair, moved just a little bit lighter as a result of Ned&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even that minor change was enough for Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《O White Devil who wanders forever.》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">永久に彷徨う白魔よ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Quietly, Alice chants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《that blossom in vain is piled up》《Remnant snowflakes dance in the sky.》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">徒花は積もり</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> , </span><span style="font-weight: 400">名残の雪が空に舞う</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s sword glowed pure white and its outline became as vague and dim as snow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill release────《White Flower》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">白咲</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after Alice drew her sword, the slash became countless snowflakes that danced around the crippled ape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The snow touches the body of the King Ape. At that moment &#8211; a white flower bloomed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slash is transformed into a flower. That was the effect of the skill 《White Flower》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White flowers are blooming and spilling over, the King Ape is swallowed by a storm of slashes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuha,Hahaha…!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing Alice, who moves much better than she did at the Valour Festival, Exzair laughs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that he was using a girl with such strength as a puppet made Exzair see a blackened hope. He can&#8217;t stop laughing when he thinks that he will be able to control this strength at will forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Guruaaaaaaaaaaaa ── !!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The abandoned monkey bellowed and moved its limbs in a messy manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice retreated once, then looked at the candidates around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um &#8230;&#8230;I have a suggestion &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, her splattered sweat glistening like snow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,why don&#8217;t we all defeat this monster and move on &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a nervous look on her face, Alice looked at everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time she had proposed to someone like this. Alice&#8217;s pure white cheeks gradually flushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I refuse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s eyes darted to Husen&#8217;s shortly announced response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who didn&#8217;t expect to be turned down, looks at Alex with a troubled face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I&#8217;ll pass too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ee&#8230;.eeee..EEE!!? Why&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who did not expect even Alex to say no, gets teary-eyed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex smiled half-heartedly at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll handle this on our own&#8230;&#8230;You guys go ahead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Alice, who is unsure of the true meaning of his words, Alex continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can take him down by yourself, can&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s lips tightened involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They saw through it.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]──The idea that if they all defeat the King Ape, instead of continuing to defeat it alone , everyone will move forward together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But both Husen and Alex are people who aspire to be a Hero. They do not take kindly to such gentle concern from Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They saw through Alice&#8217;s kindness &#8211; and gave way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair is about to head deep into the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment&#8217;s hesitation. However, Alice, who instantly realised that hesitation was an act that would stain their resolve, bowed her head deeply and headed for the depths of the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King Ape, perhaps wary of Alice, does not follow her and her party as they walk away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alex&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, guys.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex apologises to his party members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t&#8230;..probably be proud of myself if I become a Hero with the help of that girl.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex’s face was somewhat refreshed as he told them this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing their expressions, Rygan and the rest of Alex&#8217;s friends smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, they were not likely to be chosen for the heroic party. But they had no regrets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I didn&#8217;t expect you. I didn&#8217;t realise you had the same idea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.hmph.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex looked at him and Husen played with his knife irritably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure?　You seemed to be going into this exam with an extraordinary amount of determination&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Alex insisted that candidates should not fight with each other, Husen told him, [Is that how prepared you are for this exam?].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex expects that Husen has some kind of larger purpose in mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The reason we&#8217;re trying to become a hero party is to cultivate the Devil&#8217;s Forest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Alex stiffens at the unexpected revelation, Husen speaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People call me the poster child of survival, but&#8230;.who would like to live like that? We are all people who have been forced to live in a harsh natural environment for as long as we can remember.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sounding bored, Husen continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So when we were chosen as the heroic party, we were going to cultivate and strictly control every single one of the danger zones like the Demon Forest&#8230;..But we don&#8217;t have to become a heroic party ourselves if the others can fulfil that aim.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. you think she&#8217;s going to accomplish that for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s strong, but she&#8217;s a softy. We could use her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen recalled Alice, who had saved him from the King Ape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That girl saved Husen, who had been so hostile towards her, without a moment&#8217;s hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a good-natured person to the point of being dumbfounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he felt that if a person was going to be a hero, He felt he could&#8230;.trust her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Red hair, don&#8217;t drag our feet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s my line, Green Shadow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Husen lightly floats his knife upwards. The number of knives kept growing: two, three, four.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex took out a sword in his right hand and a fluorescent crystal given to him by Huizen.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time when Alice and her friends were fighting the King Ape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren Duvalis was running at full speed through the nest of the abandoned dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Kyukyiiiiiiiiiiii──』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it,so persistent&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monster flying overhead made an ear-splitting noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a bird with half its body hair turned into grey armour. The distance makes it difficult to see its size, but its body was the size of a tree trunk, and its legs alone were well over Seren&#8217;s height.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A special monster that lives in the nests of abandoned dragons &#8211; A Garuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monster, which all parties should be wary of, was staring at Seren with an angry glare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noー&#8230;&#8230;what can I say, I&#8217;m so sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Seren, a girl with light green hair in a ponytail was running with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei, the wind dancer. She is a wandering entertainer who performs all over the world and she apologised to Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t forgive you even if you apologise&#8230;&#8230;! Why should I be chased around together with you&#8230;..a Garuda at that!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because Seren passed in front of us while we were fighting it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t make up such lies! You girls must be the ones who approached me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying it, Seren also glares at the girl running with her on the other side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha!! Well, well, let&#8217;s all get along!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina, the Iron Fire Spear. She is not only an adventurer, but also a cook. Her insistence on gathering all ingredients with her own hands has given her the strength to kill any monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then again, why is the monster so angry? Is it because I took its eggs? Or is it because I caught a bird-shaped monster nearby and roasted it whole?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing during this final exam?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,eating? It’s a roast bird and extremely delicious!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eati──…”’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren draws her sword from its scabbard and turns around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Sen!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren blows away the grey feathers that are pouring down like rain with a single sword stroke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feathers are incinerated with a violent thunderclap.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At their feet, the feathers of the Garuda that Seren had been unable to block were stuck in the ground. Immediately afterwards, the ground turns grey around the feather and turns to dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s a nasty, nasty feather&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren&#8217;s sword shatters with a clatter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an exchange that has been repeated many times. The crippled birds attacked Seren and his men unilaterally from high in the sky. The feather bullets released from its wings have the effect of corroding the target they come into contact with, and will be fatal if they touch it in the flesh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Li, leader &#8230;&#8230; hey, wait &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large man running behind them lets out a grunt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not only Seren, Mirei and Fina who are fleeing from the flying monster,Garuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Seren, Mirei and Fina have their own party members and they are starting to get tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;if we just run away like this, we&#8217;ll be wiped out soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But the Garuda is still flying in the sky….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei and Fina began to strategise with a difficult look on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren silently glanced at them.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Using the skill of 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 may be able to break the situation, but&#8230;..if I use it now, there is a possibility that another party will take advantage’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of the seven swords Seren had prepared, she has used one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The goal of the final test is to bring back the national treasure of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, the 《Dragon Crown Sword》. But being the only one treasure that exists, the competition between the candidates will start sooner or later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, that girl is also taking part in this final examination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice Feldrant. If Seren is going to fight her, she needed to take all possible precautions.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;These girls must have similar thoughts.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren glares at Mirei and Fina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The enemy is not only the Garuda monster. The gut-wrenching battle has already begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren thought so and stored her second sword in the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》but── .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh no! There are monsters coming from the front too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina alerts them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A deer-shaped monster with large antlers was charging at Seren and the others, who were fleeing from the Garuda. Its knobby horns have countless thorns. If it lunges at them, they can&#8217;t escape unschathed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will distract the Garuda!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei said and leapt high towards the Garuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Wind treading shoes》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei&#8217;s shoes are covered with wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, Mirei was floating in the air. Apparently, she has a special armoury that allows her to fly. It is a power befitting her nickname, the Dancer of the Wind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Iron Fire Spear》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the Garuda’s attention was diverted, Fina held up her spear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tip of the spear was burning. Without stopping to run, Fina used her momentum to thrust the spear into the deer-shaped monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spear pierces the monster and its body burns intensely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The special armoury 《Iron Fire Spear》&#8230;&#8230; is undoubtedly a powerful weapon that burns the target it pierces, but Fina uses it more for cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Monster down!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Fina!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei, who had been flying in the sky, joined them and they all fled together again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren looked suspiciously at the girls who were fighting, exposing their skills and not worrying about their physical exhaustion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. aren&#8217;t you girls scared?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren asks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re in competition against each other, you know?　Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d attack you from behind, for example, with such an unprotected&#8230;..appearance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a serious question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Mirei and Fina just smirk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so serious, Seren.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat taken aback, Mirei said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I trust Seren because people who are willing to attack others won’t bother to say so!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina said with a carefree smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren was taken aback by their lack of hostility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren! I have a proposal!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina looks at Seren with innocent eyes and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re going to try to bring down that Garuda monster somehow, so that you can finish it off…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina then runs towards the Garuda monster without hearing any reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei also immediately activated her 《Wind treading shoes》 and approached the  Garuda monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oiiiii, this way!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei provokes the Garuda monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Garuda monster is probably the strongest creature in the sky of this forest. Therefore, no creature would normally approach it. That is why it is showing an excessive reaction to Mirei attempting to approach it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Garuda–san, come over here!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei flew with the bird in a calm and composed manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei&#8217;s movements in the sky were fluid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her light green hair and the green phosphorescence from her shoes trace trails in the sky. Flying freely back and forth, left and right, up and down, Mirei was like a fish swimming in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, Mirei has wowed countless audiences with her flying skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dancer of the wind. Mirei performs a dance that lives up to its name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Garuda, bewitched by Mirei, is gradually led to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now! Attack at once&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Fina&#8217;s signal, the two parties launched an attack on the Garuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei&#8217;s companions use their experience as acrobats to throw knives and daggers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina&#8217;s companions attack the crippled bird with bows used for hunting and knife-like swords.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Garuda gradually lost altitude as a large number of weapons pierced its wings.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.Riese. Is this the strength you seek&#8230;.?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren looked at the landscape in front of her with a calm and collected face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who should be competing with each other are united in fighting the monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fall down you Garuda Monster──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina ran up a nearby tree and thrust her spear directly into the body of the crippled bird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, a burst of flames engulfed the bird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Gyiiiiiiiii──iiii!!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Garuda Monster screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing its shrill voice, Seren cools her thoughts further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Companions. Surely the word is right, attractive and carries an impression that should be embraced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Seren knew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are people who have been made gutted by the presence of their friends.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I do not approve of this kind of power ────’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staring at the Garuda monster falling to the ground, Seren reaffirmed her resolve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren, now!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina pulled out the spear that had pierced the Garuda and looked back at Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Seren did not respond to her voice and did not move an inch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Seren!? What are you doing, quickly..!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──You are weak because you rely on someone else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren backed away from the Garuda and stared straight at Fina and the others, who were expecting Seren&#8217;s blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bird slowly got up and spread its wings, leaving Fina and the others bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am different.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren says, looking at the bird that flew up into the sky again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would certainly be easier to rely on someone else. But it is nothing more than revealing their own weakness, that they cannot face the situation alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as they continue to rely on their friends, that weakness will never be wiped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren cannot accept that by any means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can defeat any enemy&#8230; alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren glared back at the Garuda Monster that flew high in the sky that glared at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the sword in the special armaments 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 is drawn, lightning clings to the blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren throws the sword &#8211; straight down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A single flash of light pierced through the abandoned bird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Gigiyiii──!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren sheathed yet another sword and threw it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lightning bolts streaked from below to above. The normally impossible sight was a gut-wrenching and violent attack, as if it were destroying and twisting the laws of nature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Garuda monster falls again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren does not miss that opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill release──《Flower Dance of Lightning》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fourth sword is sheathed. The sword&#8217;s hilt turns yellow and becomes electrified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren swung the sword, which had turned into lightning itself, with blinding speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The huge body of the Garuda splits open and a large amount of blood splatters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the dead bird, Seren let out a small exhalation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, Seren&#8217;s sword shatters. She used a superior sword compared to the one she used at the valour festival, but it damaged the hardness of the Garuda&#8217;s flesh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After putting the sword on her back into the scabbard at her waist, Seren calmly looks back towards Mirei and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want to do? If you want to, I&#8217;ll fight with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren tells them without hiding her wariness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, Mirei and Fina shook their heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t do it&#8230;&#8230;I’m in such a state.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Mirei pointed to her left arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mirei&#8217;s left arm was greyish around the elbow and she seemed unable to move it properly. It seems that she had been attacked by a feather when she had guided the Garuda Monster to the ground earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina is similarly injured, with a slightly inflamed leg. She must have lost her position and twisted it when she landed after thrusting her spear into the crippled bird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this was merely a lack of self-care for Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She interpreted it as a weakness, peculiar to people who rely on someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren, sure you&#8217;re strong, but&#8230;something about you makes me uneasy to watch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fina tells her with a serious expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren ignored her words and headed deeper into the forest.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After defeating the Garuda Monster, the calm Seren realised her blunder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has only three swords left. A slightly disappointing number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, she had intended to avoid exhaustion, but why had she been so eager? If she had wanted to, Seren could have pushed the Garuda Monster to those two. .</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That Garuda monster….I can&#8217;t say I am confident in defeating it alone.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Garuda Monster had already been drained of its strength by the wind dancer Mirei and it had already been severely damaged by Fina the Iron Fire Spear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that state, Seren can&#8217;t proudly say that she defeated it alone when she tore it to pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren was getting frustrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren stepped on the ground a little more forcefully than usual, and as she continued walking, she came to an open area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The trees in the area were stark white. There was a rock at her feet and when she tried to step over it, the rock crumbled easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the area is more strongly affected by the corrosive force scattered by the corpses of the dead dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The branches and leaves of the trees turn to dust just by being exposed to the wind and pile up like snow underfoot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So here, in spite of being in the heart of the forest, the sun was shining.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is something that shimmers and sparkles in that sunlight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s &#8230;..《Dragon Crown Sword》.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren finally found what she was looking for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A special armament with immense power, which could borrow the power of the dragon with whom it had formed a friendship. The sword, worthy of being a national treasure, was beautiful to look at and looked more like a work of art than a weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword was thrust into the ground without a sheath and no sheath could be found. There are special armaments with a scabbard as the main body, such as the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》, but from the looks of it, the sword is probably the main body of the 《Dragon Crown Sword》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Seren approached the sword, she heard multiple footsteps from ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gaze crosses with a girl with bluish black hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice Feldrant&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren, san&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Quickly, Seren puts her hand on the hilt of her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice panicked when Seren began to prepare for battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait?　Why&#8230;&#8230;do you need to wait?　Don&#8217;t tell me you think you can avoid a fight in this situation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren says without releasing her stance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Judging from the content of the final exam, it&#8217;s probably already factored in that the candidates will be competing with each other for the 《Dragon Crown Sword》. In fact, that may be the aim.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice showed a frightened demeanour, as if she were a small animal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But her eyes ── they were looking straight at Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s&#8230;..not it, I think&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a small voice, Alice refutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because&#8230;.if you want to compare the strength of the candidates with each other, the second exam would have been enough&#8230;..so I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what this final exam is about…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, Seren gritted her teeth in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she quickly tried to retort, but remembered that she did not want to get into a tongue fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we are only speculating the answer right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren exhaled her frustration out of her body with an exhalation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let the&#8230;..winner decide which of us is right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Seren drew her sword from its scabbard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Se, Seren–san, I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren swung her sword without question at the bewildered Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice quickly moved to the side and avoided Seren&#8217;s attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a look that says, [I don&#8217;t want to fight&#8230;..], Alice also draws her sword from its scabbard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Phantom Dance of Lightning》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin!!!》”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lightning strikes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren&#8217;s strike was extremely powerful. However, ahead of its trajectory was Alice&#8217;s slash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Seren&#8217;s sword touches it, Alice&#8217;s slash liquefies like melting snow. As if slipping through Seren&#8217;s sword, Alice&#8217;s slash came close to Seren&#8217;s neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren quickly evades and retreats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately or unfortunately, she had not yet managed to cut Alice so her sword is still undamaged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, a shadow falls from above Seren&#8217;s head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t &#8230;&#8230; forget us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch, who had leapt high before she knew it, swung his huge axe at Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren instantly saw that the axe was specially armed and defended it with her electrified sword. The violent impact sent sparks flying and the ground cracked under her feet &#8211; but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but you don&#8217;t have the same Existence Power as me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Seren drew her sword, lightning flashed with a thunderous roar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch jumped back as quickly as he could. However, he could not avoid all of the lightning strikes and his side was burning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren wanted to take down Kirch for a start, but immediately afterwards, an arrow was shot from somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not a special weapon or anything, just an arrow. She avoids it with minimal movement as it is at a speed she can see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Alice, Phylicia calmly took out the next arrow from the arrow barrel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; good coordination. But such coordination doesn&#8217;t work for me either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren sarcastically spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Sereb can never let her guard down. Especially Alice and the grey-haired young man beside her. That man has special armaments that allow him to move through space. It would be tricky to be struck by him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice Feldrant&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren runs with a lightning bolt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The yellow shining sword of Seren and the pure white sword of Alice, which is engraved with a snow pattern, violently clashed with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They seem to have the same quality of special armaments as well as the same level of existence power. A storm blows around the two of them, and the ground is cratered by the shockwave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A clash of power and force so great that the space is distorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surrounding trees are reduced to dust by the pressure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, there was a huge earth tremor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ground is &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their feet shook violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Seren each jumped back in the opposite direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment──a huge snake emerged from the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monster!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren is startled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ground cracked and a terrifyingly huge snake-shaped monster emerged from underground. Behind the cracks in the ground there is an endless darkness.Apparently there was a large cavity under their feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The《Dragon Crown Sword》 is falling&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says in a panicked mode.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren immediately reaches for the falling 《Dragon Crown Sword》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, Exzair also emits a black mist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, both were one step behind. The national treasure 《Dragon Crown Sword》 falls into the underground space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s become troublesome, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once both sides had retreated, they once again saw the full appearance of the monster that had emerged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its body surface was covered with a grey outer shell, just like the King Ape and Garuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t be&#8230;.. the third mutant&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia opens her eyes and looks at the monster in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an unexpected fact. But if they think about it, the possibility was not zero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, before this test began, Rushia Enuvidia said. [──At the moment, two mutant species have been identified.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a place that has not been properly explored for 40 years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not surprising that there are unknown monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s call it the abandoned serpent , shall we? &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s quite large”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not possible to judge it from its appearance alone, but years of experience have given Seren an intuition. Perhaps the abandoned serpent  is stronger than the Garuda monster she just fought. It probably ate more of the carcass of the Abandoned Dragon. Unlike the Garuda, the epidermis of its body was also mostly covered in hard armour.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well. How do I go about getting the 《Dragon Crown Sword》 from here&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren wanted to wait for the abandoned snake to make its move. If an opportunity arises, She will go down to the hole at that moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Abandoned Serpent slowly leans towards them and glares at them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Seren readied her sword a deafening roar can be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is that sound, &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, my head is&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyiiin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and a high-pitched sound that echoes directly into her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vision blurred as her legs weakened. Kneeling on the ground, barely holding on, Seren realised that the tail of the Abandoned Serpent was quivering at high speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serpents do not make a roar, but produce sound by quivering their tails. The snake-shaped monster, the Abandoned Serpent seems to have this property.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, the sound gradually becomes quieter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren stood up on shaky legs.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The sound is too loud to be a threat. What is that sound really for──?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren felt a creepy, unpleasant feeling and looked behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t her imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Monsters are gathering&#8230;..!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren now realised that this was the reason for the sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the Abandoned Serpent has gathered the monsters that inhabit the forest in this one place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren–san! In front!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s cry brought Seren back to her senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large tail of the abandoned snake was approaching from the front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gahhh &#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren quickly guards herself with her sword, but the tail is huge and she has no chance to defend it. Seren is flung backwards with great force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her field of vision shifts in a flash. Penetrating countless trees, Seren was knocked to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren stands up, coughing up a small amount of blood from her mouth. It seems that the brittle trees, which had become brittle due to the force of the corrosion, acted as a cushion. Thanks to this, she escaped serious injury.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is bad, &#8230;&#8230;I’m isolated, I’m in…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is dangerous to act alone in this densely populated monster situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Seren quickly contradicts herself.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;..No, this is different. Isolation is not a bad thing for me. That&#8217;s just a sign of weakness. ’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren gets up and looks around, bracing herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Countless eyes lurked in the darkness, watching Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu,aaa────!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A cold sweat broke out all over her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everywhere she looked, monster eyes were staring at her. Their ferocious eyes, shining suspiciously in the darkness, see Seren as a tasty prey.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are too many of them &#8211; too many.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren hurriedly pulled the sword from her back. At the same time, she realises. There are only two swords left.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s impossible. With only two swords left, I can&#8217;t fight this many monsters.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren hid at the base of a large tree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monsters of all sizes search for her. Seren felt an instinctive fear at the way they moved, as if they were slowly and gradually taunting their prey.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What do I do?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No answer came to Seren&#8217;s frustrated brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, she pondered nonsensical hypotheticals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If I had been with my friends, would this have happened?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[If I had formed a party like Alice and fought together, would there still be hope?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a great deal of potential. If her companions had swords, they could have stored them in the 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 and Seren could still have fought. While distracting the monsters with a diversion, they could have secured an escape route, and one of them could have broken free of the siege and gone to call for help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Seren could not allow that possibility.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don&#8217;t be silly, me, please &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if she hid, she would soon be found eventually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren gripped the hilt of her sword tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t need anyone&#8217;s help&#8230;.!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yellow lightning gushed out and all the monsters lurking in the darkness turned towards Seren at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With blinding speed, Seren slays the monsters one after the other. At the time of the Valour Festival, she was using a mass-produced sword, but the sword she is using now is more expensive than that. It is not so easy to break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after cutting down around fifteen monsters, the sword shattered with a cracking sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One sword left. In contrast, the number of monsters is not decreasing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren, seeing the hellish scene, shouted as if to inspire herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Flower Dance, Of Lightning!!!!!》aaaaaAAAAAAaaaa”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sword that turned into lightning, Seren reaves the monsters around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More than ten monsters died with that single blow alone. But using the corpses lying on the ground as footholds, the monster swarms closed in again. It was like an endless tsunami.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It slashed monsters in all directions. Her legs trembled, her sword-wielding arm went numb, and yet Seren fought on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having survived the final exam alone, Seren&#8217;s will was strong and unbreakable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the sword &#8211; unable to respond to Seren&#8217;s will &#8211; now shatters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the sword shattered, Seren realised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──She is about to die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large, hundred-footed, A centipede-shaped monster from overhead approaches with its chin wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing she could do to prevent it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the worst possible way to die. She had gone through the hero party selection test all by herself and had even made it to the final test and now she was to die here, in a place where no one could see her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears well up in Seren&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With unbearable frustration and disappointment, Seren is about to be crushed by the monster but, just before it crushes her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dazzling flash of light pierced the centipede monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re still as belligerent as ever&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The figure suddenly appears, holding Seren and moving away from the monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A female knight in pure white armour. When it came to her, Seren thought she knew more than anyone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reh, ze&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese Von Aldiana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The leader of the adventurer party 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 and a powerful figure with a Existence Power of 6.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here and Now, that person whom Seren admired the most was right in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha, why are you here&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To inform the candidates that the exam is suspended. Also, to rescue the candidates in anticipation of a situation like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese continues, looking at the monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Immediately after we heard a weird sound coming from the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair, a huge number of monsters started to move, so much so that the forest shook. Her HighnessPrincess Rushia judged this to be a large-scale abnormal situation and organised a rescue team to rush in. My party is one of the rescue teams”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Riese calmly assesses the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bu&#8230;&#8230;I rushed into the most densely populated monster area, and I didn&#8217;t expect to find you, Seren. That&#8217;s how wary the monsters are towards you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Is this the time for your sarcasm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren said sharply to Riese, who seemed to lack any sense of urgency.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look at these numbers&#8230;&#8230;no matter how strong you are, you can&#8217;t fight this on your own.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“True. I could go in, but this is going to be tough.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So why did you come to help?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A seasoned and competent person like Riese would have been able to guess. Once she sets foot in such a dense area of monsters, she can never get out again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. Everything is fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren stared at Riese with dubious eyes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What part of this situation is [no problem]?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It sounds like an escape from reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Riese seemed genuinely unconcerned and took a communication stone out of her pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;Yeah, the situation is as we expected. We&#8217;re surrounded by monsters and we&#8217;re stuck. Fighting them one by one would be no problem but there are just too many of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells Ned in a tone as if it were just a business call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, a man&#8217;s voice is heard from the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hang on for a while. I&#8217;ll see what I can do.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the voice of the man who had seduced Riese──Ned Wolkinter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘──Does he want to try to do something about it?That poor man, who can&#8217;t do anything on his own&#8230;.yet he is going to help us?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren. You&#8217;ll have to see for yourself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting away the communication stone, Riese says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I once lacked&#8230;..and what you lack now.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the communication stone away in my pouch and called out to Rushia, who was standing next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve just heard from Riese.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it go?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected. The knights we&#8217;ve already sent are not enough. We need more manpower.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were generally aware of the unusual situation that had occurred in the abandoned dragon&#8217;s den.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was such a huge anomaly that even those outside noticed it. Immediately after we heard that distorted roaring sound, the whole forest stirred violently, as if it were one living organism. We could see countless monsters emerging from somewhere and heading towards the centre of the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;..this mistress was not as prepared as I should have been.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it can&#8217;t be helped. We had a large number of knights on standby in case of emergency, and we also had the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 helping us. &#8230;..And on top of that, the lack of manpower is a situation that cannot be predicted easily&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t expect so many monsters to be lurking in the lair of the abandoned dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied to Rushia while looking at the deep forest that spreads out before me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights guarding the area had confirmed that a monster had emerged from the ground. Apparently, there was a huge underground space directly below the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest. It is likely that many monsters were living there. The forest remains buzzing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia immediately stopped the test and sent the knights who were waiting here to rescue them. The Kingsguard knight Meir also rushed into the nest of the abandoned dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, now we have to think about sending reinforcements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we don&#8217;t have any more soldiers to send out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a way of getting the message across.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told the surprised Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Adventurers. &#8230;&#8230; I shall call the Adventurers in the Royal Capital to come to our aid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the adventurers must be spending their spare time without taking requests in the hope of creating a party of heroes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they rush in now, we will have enough manpower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But then, even if we could get the numbers to increase, I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;d make it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Rushia, who looked anxious, with a straight face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is only one solution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia. Can I ask you to do one job?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that question, Rushia guessed my intention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia nodded her head seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu&#8230;&#8230;leave it to this mistress!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the communication stone from my pouch to my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Halo, Royal Capital’s Adventurers!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s Ned. I&#8217;m sorry to bother you so suddenly, but I have an urgent request.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told the receptionist at the Adventurers&#8217; Guild, with whom I am usually in good contact, what I wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A large number of monsters have been spotted in the lair of an abandoned dragon. We need as many adventurers as possible to come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I–I understand. But it will take a long time to get there from here&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem. We&#8217;ll provide the legs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist deftly prepares the request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I disconnect the communication and let out a small gasp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;.how many people will show up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know how many people are going to show up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a well-known fact that abandoned dragon dens are dangerous places. As it is also an urgent request, it is possible that not many people will turn up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, I would like to see a gathering of adventures at least double digits. </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Adventurers&#8217; Guild was crowded with more people than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, the country is holding the selection examination for the heroic party. Not wanting to miss this historic moment, adventurers were killing time in their familiar guilds, waiting for the results of the examinations to be announced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee, everyone! We have an urgent request!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a panicked-looking receptionist appeared from behind the counter and told the adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The location is the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest, where the Hero Party Selection Exams are currently taking place! Due to a mass outbreak of monsters, the examiners in the nest need to be rescued!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the adventurers heard the details of the request, they came together and discuss it with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;, what do we do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, we could go, but&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The candidates who need to be rescued are those guys who were fighting at the Valour Festival, right &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If even those guys can&#8217;t compete with the monsters, so what&#8217;s the point of us going there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurer’s reactions were, if anything, negative.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is only natural. The content of this urgent request was, in all probability, life-threatening. It was explained to them during the festival of valour how dangerous the abandoned dragon&#8217;s lair was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Furthermore, the client is Ned!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist says in a loud voice.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the ──── guild was momentarily enveloped in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone mentions the name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, that &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The murmur spreads like a wave, throughout the guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned. Hearing that name, the adventurers changed their attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That guy who bought &#8230;&#8230; us dinner the other day?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The guy who helped me with a job&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He encouraged us many times when we failed in our requests&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I had a fight with my husband, he listened to me complain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One after another, people came to talk about Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who were taught about the culture of various countries. Those who were given advice on starting a business. Those who were told about recommended magical tool shops. Those who told them about unusual tales of adventure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone had an idea of who this Ned man was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was hardly a skilled adventurer, to say the least. But he was always on their side. His good-naturedness was well known to adventurers, and even when Ned was away, many in the guild talked about him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve formed a party thanks to that guy&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Same goes for me&#8230;..Ned, thanks to him for teaching us so much&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurers talk while looking at each other and their fellow adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am indebted to him for bringing me together with my precious friends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I owe him for teaching me the important things about life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurers felt a connection with the man named Ned and they could not ignore it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, so it&#8217;s that man&#8217;s request&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone muttered in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we gotta go help ────.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the adventurers in the guild stood up.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Seren Duvalis, Riese Von Aldiana was an object of admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was not the present Riese that Seren admired, but the Riese of the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the past, she was known as Riese the White Demon. As the name suggests, she was a fierce fighter who fought like a demon in white. No matter how powerful the monster is, she will face it single-handedly and win. The sight of her pure white armour stained with blood was awe-inspiring to other adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Seren, Riese was a symbol of strength. Her way of moving forward, even when bloodied, was noble and precious, something to aspire to. When Seren saw Riese&#8217;s armour stained with blood, she was excited and thought, [This is true strength].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hellish effort was not so hard when she was getting on par with Riese. Through continuous battles with superior monsters and days full of fresh wounds, Seren eventually grew to the point where she was on par with Riese. Many adventurers came to say that the White Demon and the Thunder Emperor were good rivals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, one day, Riese changed her behaviour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese suddenly started to work with someone else. She was injured less often, was less exposed to blood, and returned from adventures more often without soiling her pure white armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese eventually formed the adventurer party 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 and became its leader. She is no longer often referred to by her former name of White Demon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for Seren &#8211; when she was a white demon felt that Riese was stronger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once upon a time, I was just chasing after strength, just like Seren.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While fighting off the attacking monsters one after the other, Riese said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren is so exhausted that she can no longer even stand up. As if to act as a shield for Seren, Riese fought the monsters without retreating a single step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I took on requests alone as much as I could, and kept my fangs honed in the harsh struggle. The strength I developed then&#8230;.certainly still lives on today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says, sweat pouring from her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was not as much room for warfare as there was for tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The skill of Riese&#8217;s special weapon, the 《Spear of the Great Radiant》, is to change the sword into the shape of a spear and throw it to deliver a ray-like blow. However, if she loses her weapons in this situation, she will soon find herself the prey of monsters. Therefore, Riese was blocked from activating the skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But one day, my family living in a distant land was attacked by monsters.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While fending off the monster&#8217;s attack, Riese continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if I went to help them now, I wouldn&#8217;t make it in time. When I was in a&#8230;&#8230;helpless hurry, that man ‘Ned’ happened to be nearby. Ned heard my story and immediately helped my family.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Immediately&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese smiled at Seren, who asked back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He heard that there was an adventurer he knew on the land where my family lived. He asked that adventurer to save my family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. That&#8217;s just leaving it to others, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, that’s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to the astonished Seren, Riese laughs dryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that&#8217;s something I couldn&#8217;t do. I couldn&#8217;t save my family with&#8230;. my strength.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese stared at her palms and muttered to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without a chance to get sentimental, the monster comes barreling in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After blocking the monster&#8217;s attack with her shiny sword, Riese dropped one of her knees and put her hands on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To&#8230;&#8230;suddenly,I’m getting tired&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.enough already. Leave me and run away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, Seren didn&#8217;t want to see Riese struggling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Riese, tired as she was, had hope in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. I told you everything is fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese laughs, as if she&#8217;s not struggling in the slightest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There &#8211; it looks like they&#8217;re here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says, staring ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, there were countless signs of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There they are──!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone notices the presence of Seren and Riese and shouts loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon other voices were heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secure our escape route! Anyone with energy to spare, draw the monsters away!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have wounded men! Call the healers!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adventurers rush to Seren and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number is not one or two nor was it ten or twenty &#8230;&#8230;it was even more than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha,&#8211;what is this&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Seren, it was an unbelievable sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adventurers, whose faces and names were unknown to her, had gathered in such large numbers to help them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently, adventurers from all over the city have come to our aid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese exhaled a [huff] and smiled with relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurers have managed to stall the monster hordes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had made it this far almost unscathed, probably because Seren and the other candidates had killed the monsters along the way. Especially now that the Garuda and King Ape  have been defeated, the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest is no longer as dangerous as it used to be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Seren is stunned, a healer woman approaches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll get your injuries fixed now&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman uses magic to heal Seren&#8217;s external injuries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see you both are alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A familiar voice is heard among the assembled adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A young man with dark hair, dark eyes and a dull face &#8211; Ned has arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you here&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s easier to understand what&#8217;s going on if you&#8217;re on the ground.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned said quickly, took a communication stone out of his pouch and spoke to someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you hear me?&#8230;.Yeah, Seren&#8217;s place is safe now. The evacuation of the other candidates is largely complete. Riese and I will be on our way to rescue Alice and her parties, so I want everyone to continue to be on the lookout for the area.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned was familiar with the situation and was in charge of a group of adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You arrived early.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says to Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Rushia brought me here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she heard those words, Seren understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia Enuvidia. She is the princess of this kingdom and a girl with dragonification disease. Seren can imagine that if he is carried by the dragonised girl, he can quickly travel from the royal capital to the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More questions are popping out in Seren’s mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are the adventurers in front of her and Her Royal Highness the Princess cooperating with this man?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The questions overflow into words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you &#8230;&#8230; following that man &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurers beside her rolled their eyes at her question and looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why…? It’s hard to put in words&#8230;Well, you know, everybody helps their friends right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I owe him a lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I want him to keep helping me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I want to drink till morning with him again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the adventurers were laughing happily as they talked about Ned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing them like that, Seren feels strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seren&#8230;&#8230;do you understand now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese said while looking at Ned who was holding the communication stone to his ear and continued to command.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a strength I don&#8217;t have.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With deep respect, Riese said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, Seren learns why Riese changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese──this strength was what she was so passionate about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how many bloody battles she repeats, she will never get this strength. It is a strength that not only Riese, who was once known as the White Demon, does not have, nor does Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why Riese formed the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She now understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She understood why Riese  changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And why Riese was so passionate with this strength and why.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned Wolkinter”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After having her wound treated, Seren approached Ned and called out to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This final exam, please retire me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am not fit to be a Hero now. I will broaden my horizons and get to know the&#8230;..world better.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The grey-armoured serpent leans its body over and threatens them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice confronts the Abandoned Serpent with her sword at the ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren has already left the line of fire. The party members present must fight the huge monster in front of them alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Abandoned Serpent was undoubtedly stronger than any monster Alice had ever fought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was a certain emotion that sat in Alice&#8217;s heart when she was facing the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not a feeling of wanting to escape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not a feeling of fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──If she leaves this monster unattended, someone could be in danger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s will to fight was boiling over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, listen to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair spoke to Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My 《Void Sky》 requires me to see the coordinates of the destination at least once. Once that is satisfied, the rest of it, no matter how great the distance is, I can move freely&#8230;.But right now, the hole where the 《Dragon Crown Sword》 fell is shrouded in darkness. I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t transport myself with my powers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair said, staring at the great hole at his feet. The darkness is so deep that he cannot see the 《Dragon Crown Sword》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you draw that Serpent to you. I will pick it up during that time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair said, glaring at Alice, as if to say whether or not she would do it. But.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s a&#8230;&#8230;guaranteed,No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice replies in a trembling voice to the exasperated Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, that monster&#8230;&#8230;is probably very strong, so&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at the moment Alice replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The snake&#8217;s tail reared at a speed unlike that of a huge figure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice leaps and avoids it with a light body movement, and Exzair quickly produces a black mist and moves a short distance away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The monsters around the forest&#8230;..have started to move too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Countless monsters, gathered by the Abandoned Serpent, turn on Alice and her party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With only four of them, Alice and her party were quickly surrounded and had nowhere to run.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku…..!!!”?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Filia failed to escape and was about to be crushed by a huge ant-shaped monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──《Snow Origin》!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Alice stands in front of Phylicia and activates her 《Snow Origin》 skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snow flutters and the monsters in the area are cut to pieces by white flowers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, however, Alice is also hit in the shoulder by a skalengeck and lizard-shaped monster that is coming at her from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s…alright&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice quickly slashed the monster and retreated, but blood was flowing from her shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia immediately rushed to Alice&#8217;s side and treated her with the 《Balance of Purification and Healing》</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Magic and special armaments for healing are often made more effective by the medical knowledge of the user. The 《Balance of Purification and Healing》 is no exception to this rule, and its effectiveness is enhanced by an accurate understanding of the condition and location of the wound. That is why Phylicia worked in a sanatorium  and acquired medical knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s dangerous to take on the Abandoned Serpent and this mass of monsters&#8230;..at the same time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch said as he held up his axe to protect the two girls who were being treated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place&#8230;.it&#8217;s difficult for us to defeat this mass of monsters on our own. &#8230;&#8230; But if the monsters were summoned by the Abandoned Serpent, they might disappear by defeating the Abandoned Serpent&#8230;.we should probably concentrate on defeating it here&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;But even if you do concentrate, you can&#8217;t ignore the monsters around you.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;..So, this large number of monsters can only be attracted by someone acting as a decoy&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch nodded with a mysterious look on his face at Phylicia&#8217;s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The question is who will be the decoy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s help would be essential if the Abandoned Serpent is to be defeated. Therefore, Alice cannot be used as a decoy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch has difficulty with foot speed. He is good at shielding his companions and unleashing high-intensity blows, but he would not be suitable as a decoy, which requires quickness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest are Phylicia and Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair won&#8217;t do it. He won&#8217;t ever do it. This man is only acting on the organisation&#8217;s orders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no way he would take on a dangerous role.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I will be the decoy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia said with a determined look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, but that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the anxious Alice,Phylicia said in a strong-willed tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know that when I was a student, I was also an adventurer, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ha, yes. I know, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And yet I was completely unaware that you were an adventurer as well&#8230;.I regret that very much”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia continued apologetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t think in the slightest that you could become an adventurer. That&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t invite you to adventure with me, and I didn&#8217;t question anything when I saw you leaving right after school. Even though we are friends&#8230;.childhood friends, somewhere in my heart I looked down on you. On the contrary, there was even a time when I was haughty and conceited, thinking that we were the best adventurers in the school, even though you were not.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice didn&#8217;t know what to say to Phylicia, who bit her lip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice and Phylicia attended the same school and were also active as adventurers at the same time. However, while Alice was aware of Phylicia&#8217;s activities,Phylicia was unaware of Alice&#8217;s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia only thought of Alice as a shy person who left as soon as school was over. Alice is not suited to be an adventurer. She had assumed that she would spend the rest of her life as a quiet person.──This was so far off the mark and an arrogant expectation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;I strongly regret that I judged people by their looks and failed to even take an interest in them. I regret that I didn&#8217;t believe in you in the past.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Philia looks guilt-ridden and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So please give me a second chance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these words, Phylicia looked straight at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe you this time. I know that you&#8230;..you will defeat the Abandoned Serpent, won&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia says with a soft smile. However, her body was trembling slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth is that she is scared. Nevertheless, she was determined to trust Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice could not deny that decision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HA&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice nodded tearfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon Alice and Phylicia split up. Alice, Kirch and Exzair concentrate on defeating the Abandoned Serpent while Phylicia, single-handedly, attracts as many monsters as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she sprinted away, Alice noticed that the Exzair  were in the throes and hiding from view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t matter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That man told me&#8230;..that I don&#8217;t have to think about anything else.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ll be your shield.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch says, readys to face the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you don&#8217;t have to think about &#8230;&#8230; defending or evading anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the trust of her friends, Alice approached the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Abandoned Serpent is clad in an outer shell like armour. However, Alice looks closely and notices several gaps in its armour. Alice fires slash after slash towards those gaps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The liquefied slashes split through the gaps in the outer shell and split the body of the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Serpent&#8217;s tail swung down. But Alice ignored it and continued to swing her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch leaps above Alice&#8217;s head and blocks the descending tail with his axe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fast&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice swings her sword at a speed that cannot be caught by the naked eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Faster&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While she is doing this, Phylicia is fighting the monster single-handedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must defeat the Abandoned Serpent as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The noise will no longer be heard. The extra colour disappears from the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With extreme concentration sharpened to the limit, Alice slashed the belly of the waste snake and stabbed its tail. The pure white sword rips through the body of the crippled snake faster than the blood splatter falls to the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the crippled snake opened its jaws wide and a large amount of saliva was sprayed from its mouth cavity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the saliva touches the ground, the ground turns into fine dust and flies into the air like confetti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu…uuu,Ooo…!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch protects Alice from the spit of the crippled snake, using the 《Axe of Execution》 as a shield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The axe turned white and cracked shortly afterwards. The force of the corrosion seemed to have soaked and eroded the weapon&#8217;s interior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The abandoned snake opened its mouth wide again, but -.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《Snow Origin》&#8230;..!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice fires a slash into the mouth cavity of the snake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Snow danced in the mouth cavity. In the next instant, countless slashes ripped open the mouth cavity of the crippled snake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the quintessence of the snake has now worked, and the crippled snake sprawls about in agony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice immediately tries to follow up, but──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before she knew it, the tail of the Abandoned Serpent was approaching from behind her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before she was pushed away, in a corner of her vision, she saw Kirch lying on the ground. An axe with a broken handle is lying right next to him. It seems that the weapon is broken and he can no longer fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gi&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, who had been shot high into the sky, clenched her teeth and barely remained conscious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Below her, she could see Phylicia attracting monsters, ready to die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the sake of her friends, who believed in her, Alice gathered her strength.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A, aaaaaaaaaAAAA──!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a loud scream, Alice swung her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pure white slash is released from the pure white sword. The slash liquefies immediately after touching the head of the Abandoned Serpent and cuts through its epidermis. One eye of the Abandoned Serpent was cut in two and blood danced in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Abandoned Serpent does not die yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The falling Alice was knocked to the ground by the tail of the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No longer able to even utter a scream, Alice falls underground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U, ah&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was unable to stand up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her consciousness was already fading. Her body was complaining of its limits before her mind broke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she stays down, Phylicia will be targeted by the Abandoned Serpent. She knows in her head that she have to stop that from happening, but she couldn&#8217;t put any strength into her&#8230;.body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Alice notices something unfamiliar close by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a sword with a dragon pattern on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; 《Dragon Crown Sword》.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice slowly crawls and reaches out to touch the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, she sensed some kind of will from the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt an empty, dark and very big emotion from the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not logical. But Alice realises instinctively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Abandoned, Dragon &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword was filled with the regrets of the Abandoned Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dragon must have been holding a grudge for a long time after its death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The monsters who devour his own corpses and rule this forest with their own rule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice spun a gravelly voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you lend me your strength&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gently, when Alice touched the hilt of the 《Dragon Crown Sword》, she felt the sword pulsing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power comes. Just one more time Alice think she can fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice whipped her creaking body into a standing position and used the rubble and debris as a foothold to get out of the hole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice!!!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《White Blossom!》──!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She swung her pure white sword and sent a snowflake right in front of the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She knows that the Abandoned Serpent will not go down at this level. So this is not the real blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a dazzling white flower in bloom &#8211; Alice holds another sword in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《O Dragon》&#8230;&#8230;《my bonded contract.》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">龍よ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">), (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">契りを結んだ隣人よ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice spins as if she is speaking to the dragon&#8217;s residue that resides in the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《I will hold your pride in my heart》&#8230;&#8230;《carve your power into my sword.──》”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">あなたの誇りを胸に抱き</span><span style="font-weight: 400">),(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">あなたの力を剣に刻む</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crest floated on the blade of the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crest of a grey dragon the ability of an Abandoned Dragon lights up on the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“《I now wield you》&#8230;&#8230;《Show me your power》</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">私は今</span><span style="font-weight: 400">),(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">あなたを振るう</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Power beyond human understanding overflowed from the sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Skill Release ──── 《Breath of the Abandoned Dragon》!”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p285-720x1024.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1024" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slash was the dragon&#8217;s breath itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The breath of the dragon that once ruled this land roared out. It was like anger against the monsters that roamed around this forest with their own rules.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A storm-like blow from the Majestic Dragon instantly turned the monsters called by the Abandoned Serpent into dust, and eventually swallowed the Abandoned Serpent as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The giant serpent&#8217;s body slowly disintegrated and eventually withered into dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an instant, all threats were gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the power of the 《Dragon Crown Sword》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the power of the Abandoned Dragon. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked at the sword and whispered her thanks in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crest on the blade pulsed as if in reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia embraced Alice with tears streaming down her face.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really&#8230;..! Truly, you are more worthy of being a Hero&#8230;..than anyone else!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phy, Phylicia-san&#8230;..it&#8217;s painful&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s face was buried in Phylicia&#8217;s chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to breathe, but Alice has no energy to push away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice turned her face away and rubbed Phylicia&#8217;s back as she sobbed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Congratulations, Alice,&#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;re truly the hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kirch–san&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s tear glands relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, little by little &#8211; a sense of accomplishment came over her and she has succeeded in defeating the Abandoned Serpent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s not over yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s return back to the gathering point.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair clapped his hands lightly to attract attention and said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kirch looks suspiciously at the man who has suddenly appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exzair&#8230;.you, where have you been all this time&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never mind the details&#8230;..you know that, don&#8217;t you? My powers are rather unsuited to combat to begin with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unconvinced, Kirch glared at Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without caring at Kirch’s suspicious, Exzair approaches Alice leisurely and smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, hand over the 《Dragon Crown Sword》.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair said, as if it were a matter of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have no more strength left. I will take care of the  《Dragon Crown Sword》.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair stared at Alice while waiting for the sword to be given to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I may be smiling with my mouth, but my eyes are always honest. You know what happens if you cross me, don&#8217;t you?]　That&#8217;s what Exzair was telling Alice from the look of his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s body trembles with fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Alice glares back at him, even though she looks like she&#8217;s about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N, no&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair&#8217;s eyes widen, as if he didn&#8217;t expect to be rejected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not give you the 《Dragon Crown Sword》&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly, Alice showed her rejection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice, you──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will no longer &#8230;&#8230; obey you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, fighting back her fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. what, are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch look at Alice wondering what she meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He told me that he&#8230;..would take care of everything and that I should focus on&#8230;&#8230; doing what I thought is right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice stared straight at Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I won&#8217;t give in to&#8230;&#8230; you anymore &#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice tells in a weak and trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair looked heartily irritated at Alice. However, he quickly regained his composure when he remembered that Phylicia and Kirch were by her side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem a little confused&#8230;.this might be the result of that mysterious sword. Indeed, I should keep that for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair slowly approached Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice, Phylicia and Kirch are exhausted so they cannot make another step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Help me&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice closes her eyes tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hero Rin said to her. [All you have to do is just tell him to help you. That&#8217;s all you have to do, and that man will help you wherever you are…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ Ned–san&#8230;.. help me, please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice called out the name of someone who shouldn&#8217;t have been there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I&#8217;ll take care of it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She heard a reply she wasn&#8217;t supposed to hear.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barely in time would be an honest way to describe it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After guiding the other candidates to evacuate, I arrived at the centre of the abandoned dragon&#8217;s nest and immediately found Alice and her party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Alice&#8217;s hand is the national treasure of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, the 《《Dragon Crown Sword》.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it when I saw it. Alice had taken the seat of a brave warrior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to you&#8230;.? Did you just say leave it to you&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair looked at me suspiciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exzair Sullivan. I&#8217;m sorry, but Alice is no longer under your control.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Exzair, who now looked at me in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to be holding Kirch, Phylicia and Alice&#8217;s family hostage, but it&#8217;s all in vain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha&#8230;.kuhaha!　Such a joke coming from a single examiner!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair laughed uncontrollably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It appears that you know me&#8230;..but there is nothing you can do about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair looks down at me blandly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair then glares at Alice, who is sitting on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice. I will punish you for defying me. &#8230;&#8230; First I will kill your family. After that, I will kill Kirch and Phylicia here. In the end, there will only be two of us left, you and me. Later, I shall report that you were eaten alive by the monsters.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair revealed his true nature and gave a vile smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell Exzair without being scared by his threat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Try it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair winded his eyes for a moment, perhaps not expecting that reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the corners of his mouth immediately lifted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa──I&#8217;ll do it even if you don&#8217;t tell me to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A jet-black mist is produced from Exzair&#8217;s black bracelet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair quickly entered that fog and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, ned,san&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked at me anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair will now move on to Alice&#8217;s family and probably try to kill them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there is nothing to fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice believed in me, &#8230;I&#8217;ll make sure I live up to that belief.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I took out a black mask from inside my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Special armament &#8211; 《Isolation Masquerade Ball.》.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">孤独な仮面舞踏会</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This mask has two effects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One is disguise. If the mask is worn, it can not only hide the face, but also change the clothes at will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other is duplication.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This mask can be infinitely multiplied. Unlike the original version, the duplicate version does not allow me to specify the shape of the mask or the clothing, but I can still disguise myself properly if I wear it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already given the duplicated masks to several people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take something out of my pouch that I use in combination with this mask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a red communication stone, different from the usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The function itself is the same as an ordinary communication stone. But I used it only on special occasions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contacts registered on the red communication stone are all people to whom I have given the mask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activate the communication stone and start communicating with everyone I know who is registered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then announced to the red-emitting stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──『The Illusion King』activate”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair’s special armaments 《Void Sky》, can set the coordinates of the space it sees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the coordinates have been set, it is possible to shift freely at any time. At the Valour Festival, he shifted behind the enemy during the battle, but as the coordinates do not have to be set in real time, he can also freely shift to coordinates set in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair was transferred to the city where Alice&#8217;s family lived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For situations like this, Exzair always carries several daggers. Alice is an extremely strong adventurer, but her parents are mediocre. They would be easy to kill.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I won&#8217;t let you go&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair smiled a greedy, paint-covered smile as he searched for his target.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Alice &#8230;&#8230; you are the best puppet &#8230;&#8230;!’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair  will never get such a strong puppet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as he has that girl, he can suck sweet nectar forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a blackened emotion, he gripped his dagger and walked on ──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──You&#8217;re that Exzair, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a voice called out to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he turned around, there was a man wearing a black mask. His body shape is hidden by a grey cloak, making it difficult to distinguish his age or gender. Exzair judge that it is probably a man by his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,who are you&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The masked man laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am the&#8230;『Illusion King』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, the man slash his greatsword at Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sudden attack makes Exzair jump back, startled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The 『Illusion King』&#8230;&#8230;?　How did an adventurer of the 『Seven Meteors』 end up here &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man instantly slashed again at the bewildered Exsir.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With just a few exchanges, he can see the difference between him and the『Illusion King』.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This man is incredibly strong.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But if he&#8217;s the real 『Illusion King』, I don&#8217;t stand a chance&#8230;..!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair dripped with cold sweat. At any rate, the 『Seven Meteors』 is the world&#8217;s strongest adventurer party. The member of this group, the 『Illusion King』, is an all-round expert who can use all kinds of tactics. He hides behind a mask and cloak and is famous for not speaking a single word.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I never thought I would run into such a person.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, he activates 《Void Sky》and Exzair retreated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair was transferred to another city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Damn, I&#8217;ve fled so far away”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fear, he fled to another country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a quiet town with few signs of life. &#8230;..Naturally. It is now midnight in this city. It is midday in the Kingdom of Enuvidia, but Exzair has moved to a country with such a time difference.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you, Exzair–san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly &#8211; someone called out to him again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?!!　Impossible!! Why are you here&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a person wearing a black mask and a grey cloak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair wondered why the 『Illusion King』 was here, but──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you’re different&#8230;&#8230; another person is it&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ara, you seem to suspect something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A fact Exzair only noticed because he was able to compare them consecutively. The body shape was slightly different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the voice was definitely different. This time it was a woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I am also the── 『Illusion King』.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Dosun!!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">　a powerful sound, something was swung down in front of Exzair&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a huge scythe. The blade of the scythe, which was swung down with blinding speed, sunk deeply into the hard cobblestone ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, hi, ah&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, the difference between her and Exzair was instantly apparent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No win. Exsere quickly emitted a black mist and shifted again to another location.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a city in a desert in a scorching hot desert, dazzled by the shining sun. The change in temperature soon had Exzair dripping with sweat. Sizzling, the sun&#8217;s rays were baking his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! I found you, Exzair!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is called out again in the same way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he turned around, a figure wearing a black mask and a grey cloak was there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time it is in the form of a child. The voice belongs to a girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh,wha,what!!!? Who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a bright tone of voice, the girl said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am the──『Illusion King』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl snaps her fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair had a bad premonition. When he instinctively jumped back from the spot, the place where Exzair had been standing just a moment ago instantly exploded. It is a magic of terrifying power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair shifts again to another location.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What is this&#8230;..? What&#8217;s happening&#8230;.?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair confusion only increased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why was I being targeted by the 『Illusion King』 in the first place?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Why do people claiming to be the 『Illusion King』 appear everywhere I go?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair, who appeared in the busy entertainment district, moved to the back alleys. In his head, the information was gradually coming together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some time now, the 『Illusion King』 has been unbelievably skilled in both martial arts and magic. Exzair once thought that it would be impossible for a person to acquire that much skill in a lifetime, but if the true identity of the &#8230;&#8230;『Illusion King』 is an aggregation of several masters, then it makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the 『Illusion King』 is a master of more than one &#8211; he must be there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There must be a leader who unites all the 『Illusion King』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, there he is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice is heard from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good heavens, people are getting drunk in a good mood, and he&#8217;s just&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re getting your weapons ready, and you&#8217;re saying things like that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been bored lately. I&#8217;m just hanging out with you as a distraction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two figures were approaching Exzair while talking to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230;! No way, you guys are &#8230;&#8230; too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two men held up their swords and spears to the frightened Exsir.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We too&#8230; are the 『Illusion King』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair transferred to another location faster than he could be attacked.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But no matter where he went, it was the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re Exzair?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hi&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;ll always find Exzair in every city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re Exzair, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu──Aa&#8230;?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter where he hides, they always find him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He felt as if he had made an enemy of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AAAAAAAAAAaaaaa──!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no escape now. When he transferred to all the coordinates I could think of, all of them are the 『Illusion King』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair is once again transferred to the lair of the abandoned dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you&#8217;re back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa, haa&#8230;&#8230;! Damn it, damn it&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned tells him flatly, as if he knew this was going to happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, Exzair was confused to the point of losing his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You look like you&#8217;ve been through a lot, Exzair.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone calls out to him from behind his crouching body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man in the mask and cloak is there, as expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person is holding a shiny sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“that, that sword is &#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?&#8230;.. Oh, yes. This certainly stands out”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person whispers a little and removes the mask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cloak disappeared, revealing the person&#8217;s true identity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a familiar woman with a neat beautiful face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The twelfth 『Illusion King』,Riese Von Aldiana. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve mentioned&#8230;.this title.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who holds the special armament 《Spear of the Great Radiant》, stands in front of Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Riese, Ned was standing fluently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at this, Exzair intuits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a trembling voice, Exzair says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it you&#8230;..? Is it all your fault&#8230;..?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He doesn&#8217;t know why he thought that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is possible that this man simply asked the『Illusion King』 to do it for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as much as he hates to admit it, Exzair felt something about this man from the moment he met him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the dignity of a strong person, a dignity that only a fierce man who has fought a hundred battles is allowed to wear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, there&#8217;s nothing I can do if it&#8217;s by myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned said as he put his hand inside his pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But with everyone&#8217;s help ──── I can do anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Ned took out a mask from his pouch and showed it to Exzair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you. I&#8217;m Ned Wolkinter, the first 『Illusion King』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned tells him with a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair, crouching, lets out his anger and confusion in his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If only you weren&#8217;t here──Aaaaaaaaaaa!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exzair, who has lost all sense of reason, attacks Ned, clutching his dagger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Exzair was slashed to pieces by Riese, right in front of Ned.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the man who had died so easily in front of me, I relaxed my shoulders just a little bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately took out the red communication stone and contacted my companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Deactivate the 『Illusion King』. Thank you all for cooperating with me&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll thank everyone again some other time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, the 『Illusion King』 did not show himself in public, nor did he ever make a sound. Therefore, it was seldom noticed that its true identity was more than one person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was active as a member of the 『Seven Meteors』, every time I went on an adventure, I would call one of my companions who was most suitable for that adventure, and that person was the 『Illusion King』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So for me, the 『Illusion King』 was the companion of my former adventure party and my way of life itself, using human connections as a weapon. Despite the sudden activation, many of my friends responded. I strongly feel that the connections we once had are still alive and well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the one and only power I have developed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the only thing I have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But with it, I can do anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s all settled”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says as she sheaths her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, all I have to do now is go back to Royal Capital──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I patted my chest in relief and turned towards Alice and at that moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone fell from overhead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who had descended from the sky appeared to have managed to evade even Riese&#8217;s vigilance, not to mention my own. A violent earth tremor shook my body and the rolling dust blocked my vision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who was nearby, cleaved her sword to the side with all her might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A blast is created, blowing away the dust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;.I see. Bastard Exzair, you messed up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has bulging muscles and ferocious twin eyes like a predator. The man with the ferocious aura looked at the dead body of Exzair and then shifted his gaze towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?　Oioi, the 『Illusion King』is here? Oh dear. &#8230;&#8230;Will the leader be angry with me? No, but I was told to hurry. &#8230;&#8230; I guess it can&#8217;t be helped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man sighs as he ruffles the back of his hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese asks, holding her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man smiles wryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nain Yggdrasil. If I say that, will you get the message?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ナイン＝ユグドラシル</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shiver runs through my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feign calmness so as not to let anyone realise how troubled I am. Riese is also probably in the same state of mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The darkness that lies in the Amdo Empire &#8211; Yggdrasil. It is an organisation that should not be involved, as it is constantly rumoured to be repeating atrocious human experimentation, and those who get deeply involved in it die in a strange death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man in front of me seems to be a member of that organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if I remember correctly&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain Yggdrasil is ranked 29th in the strongest human race.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is stronger than theDragonised Rushia  and Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be so alarmed. I&#8217;m just here to get a feel for the situation. I wanted the 《Dragon Crown Sword》, but I don’t want to go on a rampage and stand out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yggdrasil, for all its power and military might, avoids being conspicuous. There are disturbing signs that it seems to be manipulating the world from behind the scenes, but it is fortunate that it is not a tyrannical organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And&#8230;..『Illusion King』. I don&#8217;t want to be enemies with you as much as possible. Our leader has a strange sense of kinship with you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t really understand why he said that to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nain Yggdrasil&#8230; Do you want to make a deal?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suggest a deal to Nain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know what your reasons are for being in Yggdrasil. But if you have a purpose, I will do my best to help you. In return, I need information about Yggdrasil.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him seriously, Nain smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a sweet deal&#8230;&#8230;so that&#8217;s the difference between you and our leader.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He rejects my proposal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Nain laughed, somewhat good-humouredly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a very interesting guy. You have the same weapons as our leaders, but you use them in a way that our leaders don&#8217;t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What has&#8230;..this man been saying since a while ago?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leader always says that, man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain told me, looking at me with interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you intimidate me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain looks amused──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you deceive me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you cheat me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain tells me, with a look of profound incomprehension.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;Coincidence?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forbid intimidation, fraud and cheating when using my connections as a weapon. Nain&#8217;s words sounded as if he could see through such personal restrictions on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only think of one person who can accurately say all three.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He understands my policy on weapons completely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So he is definitely&#8230;a man who has the same weapon as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are using your power in the wrong way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain tells me what he wanted to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Networking is a weapon of terror.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a word I don&#8217;t understand and I don&#8217;t want to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that in this world there are people with exactly the same weapons and the opposite values as me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I&#8217;m going to leave now. I&#8217;ve collected what I need to collect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black bracelet was shown to us by Nain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the special armament belonging to Exzair, the 《Void Sky》. Nain wanted to collect this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese and I look at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this situation, it is impossible to capture Nain. Nain is stronger than Riese, stronger than the Dragonised Rushia. Alice and the others are too exhausted to fight now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;..and a word of advice, just in case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain, who was about to leave, takes one last look in my direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The reason we have kept our distance from you is because our leader wanted to separate us from you. But if you continue to encroach on our territory, as you have done this time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain&#8217;s eyes narrowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I&#8217;ll be your opponent then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nain showed a strong fighting spirit, and in the next instant he leapt high into the air and disappeared from sight.</span></p>
