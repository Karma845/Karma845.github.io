<h3>Epilogue</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ The 『The Seven Meteors』 was not something I created with the best of intentions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A year had passed since I gave up on becoming a hero by myself and started living with the help of various people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly I realised that the people I rely on have become biassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Basically, when I&#8217;m trying to accomplish something I can&#8217;t do on my own, I try to choose the right collaborators for that purpose. However, as a matter of course, in order to fulfil a highly difficult objective, the collaborators must also be carefully selected. To achieve difficult objectives, it was necessary to get competent people to cooperate with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, after repeatedly selecting collaborators&#8230;..I realised that there were six people I could rely on almost every time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are generous people who will readily accept any request, and yet they are also capable people who will not yield to any difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until now, these six people had been chosen as collaborators at different times, but one day, they all finally joined forces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when I was trying to conquer the temple in the sky. The Aerial Temple is a very dangerous place, so I called in all six of my most reliable collaborators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, we achieved more than ever before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strangely enough, the six collaborators and I, who invited them, were able to stay close to each other as if we were all old friends. This was not only in our lives, but also in our cooperation in battle. It is no exaggeration to say that we were able to fight without fear, no matter how strong the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;re probably the seven most like-minded people in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that anyone ever said so, but probably all of us thought so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, we have often acted together as these seven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the beginning of the 『The Seven Meteors』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we became renowned as adventurers at a rapid pace, and soon made our abilities known all over the world. The division of roles, which at first seemed random, gradually became clearer and clearer, and when I started inviting new collaborators every time, for some reason I was given the incomprehensible nickname of 『The Illusion King』.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything seemed to be going well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;&#8230;every glory comes with an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, we were a group of people who liked to live freely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when we were working as the 『The Seven Meteors』, the colour of the eyes of those around us gradually changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if monsters appear, this city is safe because the 『The Seven Meteors』 is here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t we leave the dangerous requests to the 『The Seven Meteors』?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here and there, such voices could be heard.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I felt reasonably happy to be relied upon by someone .Before long, they began to enjoy the days of being protected by us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurer party 『The Seven Meteors』 is a world-famous organisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The common perception of us is not limited to one city or country. People all over the world have come to look at us in that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All six of us are free spirits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing we hate the most is restraint. And yet, we found ourselves restrained by the rest of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then one day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, just as we were leaving the town for an adventure, an incident occurred where monsters attacked the town. The residents were helpless against the rampaging monsters, and the town was destroyed in a big way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the monsters left.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we returned from our adventures, the people of the city bombarded us with&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is what happens when you leave the city!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why didn&#8217;t you stay here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a storm of abuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard their words, ──── I thought it was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Security in the city is not our responsibility. So this is a complete shift of responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I realised that we were recognised on a global scale as an organisation that people could shift their blame. Wherever we go, we have a similar experience. People thought of the 『The Seven Meteors』like convenient heroes. That too, I&#8217;m sure, without realising it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I made up my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the adventure was over and each of us had settled down. I called the six of them and announced my decision.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I&#8217;ll disband&#8230;&#8230;『The Seven Meteors』 once and for all.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Towards the six of them, I told them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Originally, we should have been able to live as we liked. But lately, we can&#8217;t do that because&#8230;&#8230;we&#8217;ve stuck out too much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. We were too strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The six of them are better without me. If the six of them demonstrate outstanding coordination, there is no one who can follow them. In order to further develop our skills, I also invited lecturers from all over the world and took on every request that could serve as a springboard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, we became too strong. We became too.. Prominent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So a significant notoriety tax has arisen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s give it some time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tell everyone what you think of yourself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surely there are a lot of great people in this world besides us. Given&#8230;&#8230;enough time, they&#8217;ll be as famous as we are”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it because I had a lot of information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We became famous because we made a name for ourselves with great momentum. But if we waited a while, others would rise one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then. When&#8230;&#8230;the rest of the world says, [We don&#8217;t need you now], we&#8217;ll get together again.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until then, this is our goodbye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We decided to go our separate ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the flow of the 『The Seven Meteors』, from its origins to its dissolution.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want you to get the wrong idea, I’m not really tired of being an adventurer. It&#8217;s just that when you work with the members of 『The Seven Meteors』 you inevitably stand out. That was no good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why we decided to hide our true identities for a while and work separately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We believe that eventually, a party that surpasses us will appear&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, ────── it didn&#8217;t quite live up to expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A year has now passed since then. The fame of the 『The Seven Meteors』 is still undiminished, and no party has appeared to follow in our footsteps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are some things that just can&#8217;t be understood from the perspective of the parties involved. We didn&#8217;t &#8230;&#8230; think that the 『The Seven Meteors』 would have had such an impact on the world. We were stronger than we thought we were and people respected us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the party broke up, I was going to split up with my friends and travel on my own for a while. However, one day, Lloyd, a member of the 『The Seven Meteors』, suddenly decided to accompany me for the very fluffy reason that [it would be more fun to be with the Ned]. This is how my journey turned into a babysitting trip.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the party that was created around me and Lloyd was the 『Stardust Light』. The name is a cheap and simple one, as it is said that if a meteor breaks up and splits into pieces, it is stardust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lloyd, who is addicted to helping others, a warrior who is only interested in fighting strong opponents, a wizard who would even cross the barrier of ethics for knowledge, and a monk who can only use resuscitation and has no interest in anything other than resuscitation. The members of 『Stardust Light』 were all as individualistic as 『The Seven Meteors』. However, because they were only outstanding in terms of their abilities, they were able to gradually make a name for themselves as they somehow held the reins of power. They say there is a fine line between a fool and a genius, but perhaps there is also a fine line between a hero and a problem child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that party were to follow in the footsteps of the 『The Seven Meteors』 in the future, the 『Stardust Light』, &#8230;&#8230; modified, would be the first candidate for the hero party of the Kingdom of Intail. In reality, they are just a group of problem children, but I think they will eventually catch up, if only in terms of name recognition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, over here!.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear Princess Rushia&#8217;s voice, and that&#8217;s when I switch my thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking through the corridors of the royal castle, I looked at Princess Rushia next to me. Compared to the friends of the 『The Seven Meteors』 and『Stardust Light』, Princess Rushia is like an honours student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday. After defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon, we immediately returned to the Royal Castle and spent the day resting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And today, I was staying in a guest room in the royal castle when Lucilla told me that [Father wants to talk to you].</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus I am now on my way to the audience chamber with Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But why am I being summoned by the king?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, it&#8217;s about the Poisonous Demon Dragon, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that&#8217;s that, I agree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king of the kingdom of Intail originally asked me to defeat the poisonous demon dragon. There must be a lot of questions he wants to ask me. I hope the&#8230;. story won&#8217;t be too long, I think inwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia. How is dragonisation disease progressing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No more problems!　I haven&#8217;t had any seizures since then, and I can control my dragonification powers freely now!&#8230;&#8230; like this!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia shows the dragonisation of her right arm from the wrist upwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The claws of the dragon suddenly appeared and I let out a startled [Ooo].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t think that I would be able to use the power of the dragon so casually.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The news that the poisonous demon dragon had been defeated had already spread throughout the country. At the same time, it was also made public that Princess Rushia was suffering from the dragonisation disease. The people trust this information and are in the process of chewing on it, as the『White Dragon Chivalric Order』are the witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even after you have slain that dragon, you will still have periodic cravings to dragonise. However, you won&#8217;t suffer as much as you have in previous fits, and you can tolerate it for a few days or so. From now onwards, you should make it a habit to dragonise your body during your morning stretches.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, I shall do that. &#8230;&#8230; But now that you mention it, why does Ned know so much about the dragonification disease?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because besides Princess Rushia, I know other people with Dragon Disease.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; You really are a man of many faces.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No wonder you&#8217;re not scared, Rushia mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We reached the audience chamber as we were having a conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the door opened, a man with a kind face was seated in a large chair. His hair was rather long and he had intelligent-looking eyes. His wrinkles were less chiselled and he looked younger overall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for coming”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king&#8217;s first words were uttered in a calm tone of voice. But it is somehow powerful and echoes through the audience chamber. He is a man with a different aura from the king of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to Princess Rushia, I bow my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I wait for the king&#8217;s words, I wonder what his business is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia, stand aside.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king told Rushia to leave the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because her face was lowered, Rushia&#8217;s expression was not visible&#8230;&#8230;but I could guess Rushia was troubled and left the audience chamber with an anxious gait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silence stalls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued to bow my head, the king eventually let out a small exhale as if he had been distracted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raise your head. Like my daughter, I don&#8217;t like a stuffy atmosphere.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Haa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raise my head as I am told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to earlier, the king&#8217;s expression was softer. It seems that he really meant what he said when he said that he did not like the formal atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Laumann Enuvidia. Sorry to call you so early in the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ラウマン＝エーヌビディアだ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a friendly manner, Wang says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned Wolkinter&#8230;&#8230;Thank you for defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon. To be honest, I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be able to defeat it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“thank you. But if you&#8217;re thanking me, you should be thanking 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 and Rushia, not me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. You are a humble man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Princess Rushia told him the details of the incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, in the end, I hardly took part in the battle at all. The person who should be praised the most for this incident is Rushia, who broke out of her shell and went to the battlefield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve heard from my daughter. I was willing to sell your life for the sake of my own personal or amiability. &#8230;&#8230;you have every right to resent me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a sombre look on his face, the king told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His sombre look could not have been an act. I am sure that this man was tormented by remorse, just as Rushia was when she tried to detain me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a complicated feeling, but a single life of a&#8230;&#8230; stranger can avert a diplomatic row between countries. Anyone in His Majesty&#8217;s position would do the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king smiles unreliably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not a matter of apology, &#8230;&#8230; but I&#8217;m really sorry. I, too, was in a hurry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king bowed his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rarely does a king show such sincerity towards a mere commoner. But I was more interested in what the king said than in his attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a hurry?　For what?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The demands of the Kingdom of Intail is simple. Within a week, he must order me to clash with the Poisonous Demon Dragon. &#8230;.The deadline seems short, but with the king&#8217;s power, it would be that easy to achieve. All he has to do is have the knights under his command take me into custody and take me to the nest of the Poisonous Demon Dragon. It&#8217;s nothing to be in a hurry about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was the king in a hurry to&#8230;&#8230;kill the poison demon dragon?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, it must be…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You knew from the very beginning that Rushia was suffering from dragonification disease…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;Say no more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king interrupted my words with a slightly regretful look, perhaps realising his own gaffe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My lip is pursed and I look again at the face of the man sitting in the luxurious chair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the face of a king who bears the fate of his country, but at the same time it is the face of a father who cares for his&#8230;&#8230;daughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My daughter is a sweet girl. She can&#8217;t accept that someone else will get hurt for her. So, that’s why I have to feign &#8230;&#8230; ignorance…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s how it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as the head maid, Hersha, was aware of Rushia&#8217;s dragonisation disease&#8230;..this king was aware of it from the beginning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king is right, Rushia refuses to let others get hurt because of her. If I said, [I will organise a coalition army to cure the dragonisation disease and defeat the poisonous demon dragons], Rushia would definitely try to stop me. If there are any deaths in that battle, Rushia will think that someone died because of her, and she will be severely depressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why the king pretended to know nothing about the dragonisation disease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That way, at least, it wouldn&#8217;t be a burden to Rushia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand the situation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king was impatient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king knew that Rushia&#8217;s dragon sickness is progressing rapidly&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why they put their hopes in me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it would be impossible, but I had no choice but to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want for your reward?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king abruptly cut in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My daughter has told me of your exploits. So there is no need to be modest&#8230;..is there anything you want?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was only slightly troubled by this question before answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If so, please exchange contact details.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. contact details?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I need to discuss anything in the future, I will communicate with your majesty&#8230;&#8230; Of course, I will take care not to interfere with your official duties.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he told her this, the king laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My daughter told me&#8230;.that a man called Ned has tremendous contacts…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing those words, I smiled too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s my weapon of choice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I left the audience chamber, Rushia approached me with a worried look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How are you&#8230;&#8230;?　Are you injured or anything like that&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Injured? You don&#8217;t get hurt in a discussion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s true, but I&#8217;m sure&#8230;&#8230;Ned has a grudge against my father, and I thought&#8230;&#8230;the worst that could happen would be a fistfight.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s quite a leap of faith.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not much of a fighter, so I rarely do that sort of thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand my weaknesses as much as I hate them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not willing to put my body on the line just for the sake of being gloomy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I think &#8230;&#8230;Rushia&#8217;s father is a good king.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, Rushia rolled her eyes and then made a happy face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O–of course! After all, he is my father!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said proudly with her chest out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That king was carrying out his duties as the head of a country and his feelings as a father. I don&#8217;t think there is any mistake in that order of priority. It was inconvenient for me, but in return I received his contact details, so all the complexities are now gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot had happened over the defeat of the Poisonous Demon Dragon, but I think Rushia also respected her father in her heart. Seeing her with a cheerful expression on her face, I realised once again, the mess of the past few days had been successfully cleared up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, there you are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a voice calls out to me from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look and see May coming towards me from the other side of the corridor at a brisk pace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way, she notices Rushia next to me and stops in front of us to bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Your Highness Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the brief greeting, I noticed that May was holding something like a booklet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, what is that in your hand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;It&#8217;s this morning&#8217;s newspaper. I brought it to show you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. There are three interesting articles in the paper.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three? Tilting my head, I take the newspaper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I read them in order, starting with the article with the most prominent headline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon!　The power of the dragon in Her Highness Rushia!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I knew this would blow up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the poisonous dragon is a common threat to neighbouring countries. Therefore, the defeat of the Poisonous Demon Dragon is a pleasant fact for all countries&#8230;&#8230;Ostensibly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now &#8230;&#8230; the Poison Demon Dragons won&#8217;t be used for political purposes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttering in a small voice, Rushia and May nodded silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps some foreign countries, like the Kingdom of Intail this time, were planning to use the poisonous dragon for political purposes. However, by defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon, we were able to prevent them from doing so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom ofEnuvidia was able to overcome its international weakness of the poisonous dragon. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a great achievement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued to the second article.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ The strongest ranking of mankind, supervised by the Great Sage and the Wisdom King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article was lined with the names of a hundred people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was familiar to me and Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is in it too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article described it as a historical collaboration between the Great Sage and the King of Wisdom. However, it stated that there was no information on how this ranking was created or the intent of the ranking. Of course, no information about me was also mentioned. For many people, this article will be both interesting and strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;like the first article, wouldn&#8217;t such an article make Her Highness too conspicuous?　I have a feeling that this will lead to a number of people wanting to borrow Her Highness&#8217;s power&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May voices her concern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Rushia, who is afraid of fighting, the request to join the battle is a heavy burden. Perhaps Rushia has only now realised this fact, and her expression has changed from the cheerful expression she had earlier to a fear one. However&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think so. Read carefully here&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pointed to the first article.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The end of the article. The concluding part is read aloud by May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“According to Riese Von Aldiana, leader of 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, after Her Highness Rushia returned to human form after defeating the poisonous demon dragon, she cried a lot. She cried out that she was afraid of fighting, and looked like a child of no more than a year old…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha-w–wha-wha-wha–whatt a thing to write!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s face turned red and she exclaimed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it&#8217;s been written this far, no one would think of letting Rushia to join in any fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gunnu&#8230;&#8230;that may be so, but doesn&#8217;t this make me look like a wimp!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Munu&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia had a very complicated look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The article made it public that Rushia is not very good at fighting, to the point of tears. This should bring public opinion to some extent on her side. In the unlikely event that someone tries to invite her to fight, there will be an outcry of [Poor, poor Your Highness!] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had asked Riese beforehand to answer that way if she was interviewed by journalists. There is no problem if May, me and the others know about it, but &#8230;&#8230; it would be better to keep it a secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. Look at the third article.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May told me and I read the third big headline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content there has a big impact on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">—Kingdom of Intail, Hero party disbanded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the article, the king of the Kingdom of Intale declared so yesterday. It must have been a fairly swift process, because it was published this morning in a newspaper in another country, the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;&#8230;&#8230; I see.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the hero party 『Stardust Light』 is being disbanded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do? Should I get in touch with them again and join up with them?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No&#8230;&#8230;. I don&#8217;t have to do that, do I?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because those guys, now that they&#8217;ve set off on their journey, they won&#8217;t be back for a while. [Since we&#8217;ve gone all this way, we are going to go all the way to the Demon King&#8217;s Castle!] They&#8217;re likely to say something like that without a care in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As far as I know, this is the first time a party of heroes has disbanded so quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia, peering into the newspaper next to me, said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content of the article is also highly critical of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come to think of it, the Kingdom of Enuvidia hasn&#8217;t sent a hero party yet, has it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, for our country, the poisonous demon dragons were more of a threat than the demon king.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia replies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Poisonous Demon Dragon was a threat, which means&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu!　The Kingdom of Enuvidia will also start recruiting hero parties now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia said somewhat happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Ned. I have a favour to ask you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A favour?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a questionable look at the sudden suggestion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia smiles fearlessly and tells me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want you to be a member of the jury for the selection test for the Hero Party!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A judge for the selection test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle at the suggestion that had unexpectedly rolled in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I accept this proposal, &#8230;&#8230; I, who was trying to be a hero, even if only for a time, will now be on the side of choosing a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is indeed an ironic life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But &#8230;&#8230; strangely, I don&#8217;t feel bad about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s probably because I&#8217;m happy with the way I&#8217;m living now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ What’s this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t feel unfulfilled as much as I thought I would. I don&#8217;t feel depressed or sad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the reasons for this is probably the girl in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t be a hero. I can&#8217;t be the hero who saves the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I can at least give a helping hand to a girl in need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s enough for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel rewarded just by seeing Rushia’s smile in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just having her laugh in front of me makes me feel rewarded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have to carry the world on my back to make people proud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll meet all sorts of people again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s eyes sparkled as she nodded her head.</span></p>
