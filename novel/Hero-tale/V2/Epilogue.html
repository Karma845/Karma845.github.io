<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Enuvidia welcomed Alice and her party as the new hero party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The results of the final examinations were quickly communicated throughout the kingdom. An unexpected situation arose, but fortunately there were no deaths among the examinees other than Exzair. No one was injured permanently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the day after the results were announced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『From now on.. we will hold a Birthday Festival of the Hero Party!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Rushia&#8217;s announcement, the royal city was alive with colourful activity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All hail Alice the Hero!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hurray!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice&#8217;s party rode in a royal carriage and marched slowly through the capital, protected by the Kingsguard knights. The people approached the carriage to catch a glimpse of the hero party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia waved her hand in a friendly manner, but Kirch was somewhat unaccustomed to this. Nevertheless, he acted friendly, waving and smiling in a way he was not used to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was Alice. Perhaps not good at being exposed to the public, Alice, despite being the star of the show, was frozen in place from start to finish, like a groundhog.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a unique hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When such words were heard from the crowd, Alice had tears in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage carrying Alice and her friends eventually comes to a stop in front of the Royal Castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the end of the greetings to the people. Relaxed and relieved, Alice and her friends enter the gardens of the castle and join the dinner party being held there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good work. You worked hard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I did my best&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice looked more tired than her final exam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On her slender back was a single sword &#8211; the 《Dragon Crown Sword》》. This weapon will become a symbol of bravery for Alice in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must be hungry. There&#8217;s plenty of food over there, so why don&#8217;t you go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Alice looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um&#8230;..Ned-san, would you like to go and eat with us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? Well, I don&#8217;t mind.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also wanted to have a meal too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many of the candidates attended the dinner party. I, along with Alice, enjoyed the meal while exchanging greetings with Alex the Red-Haired and Mirei the Wind Dancer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Net-san. This is very delicious&#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh,then I&#8217;ll try it too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice recommends a dish and I go and get it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch were watching our exchange in the background.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;He missed the point.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..yea,he missed it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two people&#8217;s lukewarm gazes were unbearable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was somewhat like being treated like a cute small animal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seem to be settling in well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While we were enjoying our meal, I heard a girl&#8217;s voice from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo,yo,you–Your Highness&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice was the first to react.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was so nervous that she was about to drop her cup, so I secretly managed to stop that from happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry to interrupt, but it will take a little more time before we can officially dispatch you as part of the heroes party. Until then, you will continue to stay in Royal Capital, but I would like you to be careful not to get too carried away because of the attention you are receiving.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, yes&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And&#8230;..we should consider again whether these three are really enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia looked at Alice, Phylicia  and Kirch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that Exzair has disappeared, Alice&#8217;s party is now made up of three people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be honest, it leaves me feeling uneasy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. I&#8217;m not going to forgive Exzair, but&#8230;.I can&#8217;t deny that that man was a force to be reckoned with.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the final examination, Phylicia and Kirch were briefed on the true identity of Exzair. They both knew the situation Alice was in and felt anger towards him and regret for their own failure to not notice Alice&#8217;s abnormality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia, in particular, did not seem to have noticed Alice&#8217;s activities even when she was a student and immediately after talking to her she was quite depressed, but from the way she looks now, she has managed to pull herself together. This may be a sign of her determination to wipe out her own failings with her future achievements.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the time being, we&#8217;ll have a temporary fill-in, so the&#8230;&#8230;question is who.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia put her finger to her chin and thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beside her, May interjects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If only we had someone like Ned, all would be well&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s casual remark caught everyone&#8217;s attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa no, it&#8217;s just an idea, but &#8230;.. Ned has a good track record, and from the looks of it, Alice and her friends trust him, don&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They all look at her at once, and May makes a somewhat apologetic face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Rushia and her colleagues listened to May&#8217;s story with a serious face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm&#8230;..Ned? That&#8217;s a brilliant idea!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia told me in a cheerful tone of voice, not anxious about any of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you see&#8230;.they&#8217;re a party of heroes. It&#8217;s not that easy to fill in…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who was eating nearby, secretly overheard me with a twitchy smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yggdrasil was after the 《Dragon Crown Sword》. If you want to find out what they&#8217;re up to, it might not be a bad idea to work with Alice and her party.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a good point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words of Yggdrasil&#8217;s leader, spoken by Nain Yggdrasil, are still stuck in my ears&#8230;&#8230;What is the leader of Yggdrasil thinking? What on earth does he feel about my methods? I am not only wary, but genuinely curious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe there are people in this world who are fighting in the same way as I am.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, there are probably no other members as dependable as you. The adventurer parties led by you in both the 『Stardust Light』 and the 『Seven Meteors』 are doing remarkably well. If you care about &#8230;&#8230; Alice, you&#8217;re the right person for the job.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Overestimation is too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phylicia and Kirch tilted their heads curiously at Riese, who gave them a long-winded earful. Rushia and May both seemed to have some idea of what Riese was talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, ah, uh!　I, I want to have an adventure with &#8230;..Ned-san too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice said, her face turning bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have summoned up all her courage. Alice looked straight at me with slightly moist eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not so heartless as to refuse this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I understand. Then, please take good care of me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice smiles happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw her face like that, I knew I had made the right choice, for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Filling in for the brave party is a heavy responsibility, but I&#8217;m used to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now──who should I turn to next?</span></p>
