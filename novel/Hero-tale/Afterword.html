<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hello, this is Sakaishi Yuusaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you for picking up this book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This work is about a protagonist who fights using his connections as a weapon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The protagonist, being powerless, has learnt the greatness of relying on others. Like in the first volume, in the second volume, the protagonist builds new connections and fights using the connections he has built up so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main character, Ned, again connects with many people, but in reality, due to the Corona disaster, he is not able to connect with many people. I felt this a little while writing this second volume.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This summer in particular has been raining than usual, and I&#8217;ve spent more boring days than usual in my room. This year I have not been to the sea, mountains, summer festivals or fireworks displays.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, I am not the type of person who participates in events that much, but even if I didn&#8217;t, I seemed to realise that summer was coming when events were taking place in my neighbourhood. For example, I would sometimes go for a run when it was dark outside, and on the way there I would see a summer festival being held at a shrine I was passing and realise, [Oh, so it&#8217;s summer now], which was a regular occurrence every year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt surprisingly lonely not to see the traditional festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, however, I could somehow predict that my schedule would be free this summer, so I was able to devote myself to work with all my energy. This gave me a sense of fulfilment, so I think I had a good summer. It is good to have a year like this once in a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope that next year I will have a summer where I can see people without hesitation and problems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to write a story about what the main character in this work, Ned, would do if he had a series of days when he couldn&#8217;t see people&#8230;..I would like to write such a story one day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Acknowledgments】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to thank everyone involved in the writing of this work, including the editorial team and reviewers, for their assistance in the writing of this work, and thank you, Noy Sensei, for creating another beautiful illustration. As I thought with the first volume, I am impressed by how stylish each character&#8217;s clothing is and how it fits the character&#8217;s characteristics. Alice and Seren on the cover, so pretty and cool!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the biggest thank you to everyone who picked up this book.</span></p>
