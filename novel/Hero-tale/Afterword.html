<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p>This is Sakaishi Yuusaku.</p>
<p>Thank you for picking up this book.</p>
<p>This novel is about a protagonist who fights with his connections as a weapon.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how old you are as you read this page now, but it wasn&#8217;t until I was an adult that I realised that networking is a weapon!</p>
<p>When I was a student, I did not think that networking was a weapon. There was usually at least one popular person in my class who had a lot of friends, but when I looked at him or her from the side, I only felt that [well, it must be useful to know many people and it must be fun to be able to enjoy with many different people]. Even when I was a university student looking for a job, I was often told, [Networking is important!] I succeeded in my job search without realising the importance of networking. I remember talking to a friend of mine, [I don&#8217;t need any networking!]</p>
<p>However, since becoming a writer, there have been many occasions when I have realised the importance of networking.</p>
<p>Writers are basically sole traders, so if you want to exchange information, you have to start by building a relationship with someone. This is different from a salaried worker.</p>
<p>For me, this was the first time I really became aware of networking, and I found it more gratifying than I had imagined when I started to build a network. Not only did they exchange information, but they also supported me in many situations, such as chatting about new topics and gaining inspiration, playing together to relieve stress, and helping me with my work, which I could not do in my existing relationships.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s hard to appreciate human connections until you actually get them. This work came about naturally because I have recently had many opportunities to feel, [Wow, networking is more important than I thought]. Nowadays, the word [connections] sometimes gives a bad impression, but I think that if you get to know people in the right way, they can be a very valuable and cool thing to have. I hope that through this novel I can convey this appeal to you.</p>
<p>I think networking is a very cool weapon.</p>
