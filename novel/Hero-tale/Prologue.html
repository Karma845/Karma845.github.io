<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>It was only at the age of fifteen, when I had given up everything, that I realised that connections could be used as a weapon.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, I have continued to hone the weapon of networking and tried to lead an ideal life in my own way. As I predicted, the weapon would play an active role in all aspects of my life, and give me a definite advantage in a field where I had never had anything noteworthy to offer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has been three years since I had adventures around many different places with friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not being conceited, but I&#8217;m sure there are many feats that have been achieved through my connections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if there is a downside&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned Wolkinter. You are hereby expelled from the adventuring party 『Stardust Light』!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My weapons are difficult for others to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tracing back to those few minutes ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was visiting the audience chamber in the royal castle of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You wanted to see me, Your Majesty?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm. Raise your face.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly I raise my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large man sat on a throne in front of me. He was an old man with wrinkles etched on his face. He was the King of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are Ned Wolkinter, the leader of the adventurer party 『Stardust Light』?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon affirmation, His Majesty opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me put it simply. I would like to appoint the 『Stardust Light』to be our country&#8217;s heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A heroic party&#8230;..?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know what the word means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Hero party. They are small, elite teams dispatched by countries around the world to defeat the Demon King, who has suddenly appeared. People are happy or sad at the results that these heroes&#8217; parties bring back, and this sometimes affects the economy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These days, every country sends out a party of heroes to defeat the Demon King. In view of this trend, our country has decided to take a leap of faith and form a heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I give a friendly nod to His Majesty&#8217;s explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We spent a long time selecting those who would be suitable for the heroes&#8217; party. As a result, we have set our sights on you, the 『Stardust Light』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I am honoured.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a very self-explanatory story that&#8217;s going on without my knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I can&#8217;t say such a thing, so I shut my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From what I hear, 『Stardust Light』 sounds like a pretty good party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I&#8217;m very proud of the members I&#8217;ve gathered from all over the world.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s honestly nice to be praised for the party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I answered honestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Its proud membership appeals to us as well. So please, let the 『Stardust Light』 be our country&#8217;s heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a surprise. This was a step towards grasping glory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no reason to refuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I humbly accept your off—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Except you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king&#8217;s words were not immediately understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t understand it even after taking my time, so I voiced my doubts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Majesty then let out a sigh and explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All the members of the 『Stardust Light』 are excellent. However, only you, the&#8230;..leader, are not good enough. While the other members are S-class adventurers, you are an adventurer who barely maintains the A-class status. To put it bluntly, you are a hindrance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a hindrance &#8230; I&#8217;m the team leader.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph!　What a pathetic man you are, clinging to your position!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, The king&#8217;s tone becomes rougher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This must be his true nature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that title of team leader is questionable!　We&#8217;ve already assessed you through the Adventurers&#8217;s Guild! Explain the role of each of your members!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there are five members, including me. A knight who is in charge of both attack and defence, Warriors who can be trusted being the vanguard, a monk who acts as a healer and a wizard who specialises in long-range attack&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m the manager.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is getting absurd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Knights, warriors, monks, wizards and managers are the standard configuration though. &#8230;&#8230; In my opinion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re insinuating that  your connections are weapons! What a ludicrous excuse! You just can&#8217;t do anything without someone to protect you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230; that may well be the case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You admit you were making excuses. After all, you are just a lackey. I can&#8217;t entrust the leadership of the heroes&#8217; party to someone like you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Majesty tells me in exasperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a man standing beside His Majesty called my name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is the Prime Minister of this country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have to understand. A party of heroes on a mission to defeat the Demon King attracts attention from all over the world. Therefore, if there are disproportionate people in the party, they will receive a lot of condemnation. That will, in turn, tarnish the dignity of the Kingdom of Intail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. So why don&#8217;t you ask another adventurer party to do it for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The members you have assembled are uniquely talented. I was surprised when I investigated them myself. A knight who has received the blessing of the Almighty, a warrior who can fight forever without eating or drinking, a priest who can even raise the dead, and a wizard with three sage medals&#8230;&#8230;They are so talented that I wonder where on earth you got them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve really searched for them like hell&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the upper echelons of this country want to make the 『Stardust Light』a heroic party, no matter what their intentions are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But they don&#8217;t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the members of the adventurer party 『Stardust Light』 are not just human beings, in a good way or a bad way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s be clear on this occasion. It&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m the leader of the 『Stardust Light』, but what I actually do is closer to being a beastmaster than a leader.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. What are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That party is all the members I&#8217;ve assembled on the premise that I control them. My job is mainly liaison &#8230;&#8230;to talk to them in advance so that the damage caused by their fighting doesn&#8217;t get out. If there is no one left to do that job&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To His Majesty and the others, I told them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you&#8217;ll probably&#8230;..regret it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence reigned in the audience chamber.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, His Majesty and the Prime Minister broke the expression on their faces and</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuhaha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small chuckle is heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes!　Regret!　Then let&#8217;s look forward to it at best!　If you&#8217;re really that good, I might regret it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Majesty sneers at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I forgot to mention that, in your place, I will be adding Julius, our near-guard knight, to the party. He is the same age as you, but unlike you, he is the best of the best. He will more than make up for the hole you left out. So you have nothing to worry about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then His Majesty looks at me with condescending eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have nothing more to say, have you?　Then I will tell you again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a winning smile, His Majesty told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned Wolkinter. You are hereby expelled from the adventuring party 『Stardust Light』!&#8230;&#8230;Now, please excuse yourself as quickly as possible. I&#8217;m sure you understand, but I won&#8217;t allow you to have any contact with the heroic party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t get through him at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a small sigh and left the audience chamber.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now the obstacle is gone&#8230;&#8230;our country now has the strongest and bravest party!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, with them in action, we will be able to outmanoeuvre the rest of the world in no time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister nodded to the delighted King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Prime Minister. The exchange we just had&#8230;&#8230; you are as glib as ever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not as bad as Your Majesty, but I can take on any number of youngsters of that calibre.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haha! The two laugh together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The members of the 『Stardust Light』 are pathetic. They can thank me for unleashing them&#8230;&#8230;from an incompetent brat, who used them for good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are they simply good people, or are they vulnerable?&#8217; &#8230;&#8230;In any case, it is too good to have a party of that magnitude monopolised by a single person. Let them properly work for the country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king nodded in satisfaction at the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The chain of contacts between the Ned and the heroic party should be broken while we&#8217;re at it. I believe they have a tool to communicate. Take it away immediately.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, sir”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister bowed deeply and immediately set to work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister leaves the audience chamber. Looking at the closed door, the king slowly leaned back on his throne.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuhaha &#8230;..it is my country that will defeat the Demon King. My name will be etched in the history of the world&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king smiles with amusement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His head was filled with fantasies of himself being hailed around the world as a great hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He doesn&#8217;t know it &#8211; but decades later, the king&#8217;s name will indeed be etched in history.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was not as a hero, but as the worst dark lord.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dear friends of the『Stardust Light』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The communication does not connect, so I am sending you a letter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may have already heard, but I have two things to say to you all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 『Stardust Light』 have now been appointed as a brave party by the king of the Kingdom of Intail. From now on, wealth and fame will be at your disposal. Enjoy it to the fullest</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;..What?　Why am I writing like it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s business?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let me explain then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Secondly, I want to tell you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the stupid king, I had to leave the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I&#8217;m not fit to be a part of the Kingdom of Intail heroic party. I heard that an excellent young Kingsguard knight will be replacing me, so please get along with him from now on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I thought about taking you with me and going somewhere, but at any rate, he is the king of a country. If you go against him, you will get into trouble.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it&#8217;s an undeniable honour to be chosen for the heroes&#8217; party. You won&#8217;t lose it because of me alone. I don&#8217;t think any of you are interested in the honour…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m leaving you here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The party was originally formed just over a year ago, and if the meeting was sudden, then the parting may be sudden too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll be looking forward to your help in defeating the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You guys can probably defeat him. But it looks like there&#8217;s going to be a lot of damage instead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PS: I heard they sell really tasty bun buns in the cafeteria of the Demon King&#8217;s castle, so buy some.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the corridors of the Royal Castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was walking around trying to work out the contents of the letter I had written.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honesty, isn&#8217;t necessary right? Erasing it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Erase some sentences with a pen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the letter was completed, folded properly and put in my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a hindrance. It&#8217;s like&#8230;&#8230;I’ve finally been found out”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mumbles and mutters while scratching my hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest &#8211; what His Majesty told me was true. I was a lackey in the 『Stardust Light』, half-fed by adventurers of superior ability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least objectively, that is the undeniable truth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the Hero Party is an organisation that carries the name of the country on its back and attracts a lot of attention. It&#8217;s probably not surprising that I&#8217;m out of the picture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was walking down the corridor, someone called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turn around, there is a man clad in a white and silver armour suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, well, well, isn&#8217;t that the Hope of the Kingsguard, Sir Julius?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. Don&#8217;t take a queasy tone. Just the way you always do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to put it back the way it was because he said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People have gone to a lot of trouble to do this, even though they have done it humbly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be thankful, eh, Ned?　If I hadn&#8217;t been so tactful, you&#8217;d be carrying an undeserved burden right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my eyebrows at his words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You proposed my banishment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!　I am the one who advised your banishment!　Hahahaha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius laughed merrily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I know very well what you have been doing since you were a child. So I&#8217;m the only one you can&#8217;t fool!　You have a broad face, but otherwise you are just an ordinary man!　You&#8217;re always relying on someone else, always doing nothing yourself&#8230;&#8230;!　But you used me like a pawn during the mid-term exams and graduation exams at the institute&#8230;..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hope of the Knights immediately shook his body. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is he emotionally unstable?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius and I have known each other since we were very young. We were both born and raised in this country and went to school together at the academy, where we got to know each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, we are not on good terms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, we are the opposite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t defeat the Demon Lord! But I would have no problem with that!　I, who is known as the greatest of all time among the Knights of the Kingsguard, will be able to lead the hero party right!　And when the Demon King is defeated, I will marry the Princess and &#8230;&#8230;gufu,fufu&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..You&#8217;ve picked the wrong people for this..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This man has long been in love with that daughter of His Majesty the Idiot, that is, Her Royal Highness the Princess, and it is as if he became a knight of the Kingsguard just to be united with her. His passion is so great that he has accumulated enough achievements to be regarded as a gem, as he has said, but he is a man whose fundamental motives are riddled with inferiority complexes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our king &#8230;&#8230; doesn&#8217;t have a good eye for people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both himself and others must have a character that cares only about the top.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that it&#8217;s come to this, I&#8217;m not going to argue, but &#8230;&#8230;you, make sure you hold the reins of those guys for me. Otherwise, in the worst case scenario, the country will be destroyed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, what a load of nonsense. Are you trying to make me feel like a sore loser?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t mean to, but I keep my mouth shut, thinking I don&#8217;t need advice as he seems confident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, someone approaches me from the end of the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a girl with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a beautiful face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Princess?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the mention of the girl&#8217;s identity, Julius turned quickly and smiled wryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo, Princess! You are in a good mood toda—!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ ──Ned-sama!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gueuuhh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Princess came up to me, flicked a bullet to the approaching Julius.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from Julius, who is holding his solar plexus, the princess is closing in on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess of the Kingdom of Intail &#8211; Iris Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who were familiar with her called her Princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is Ned-sama out of the heroes party?　I don&#8217;t understand! Let&#8217;s go and protest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, the princess acts with her usual self.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are close enough to touch skin to skin. Her hair is as smooth as silk and smells sweet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, when I tried to move away a little, the Princess quickly closed the distance. I give up and decide to talk to her as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve already protested it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied with a sigh, Julius peeled his eyes and became angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, you!　How dare you speak to the princess in such a disrespectful manner?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please be quiet Julius. I asked for that one when I’m talking with Ned-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gunu&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius looks frustrated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looks as if he&#8217;s trying to say. Why do you address Ned as &#8216;sama&#8217; and call me by my name&#8230;&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have had several exchanges with the Princess and we are now able to talk casually like this. What&#8230;. should be regretted is that I should have interacted with His Majesty as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for His Majesty, I had deliberately avoided interacting with him in part because I had not heard good rumours about him, but that decision may have backfired. The most important thing to remember is that the government is not a party to the law&#8230;&#8230;.Even if they had interacted with me, the way she talked about me, they would have banished me anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, the 『Stardust Light』 will all run riot freely&#8230;..and do fine without me. They might actually be able to defeat the Demon King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is, if they can be properly controlled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So why don&#8217;t you support them together?　It is for the best that the demon king is defeated and the world is at peace. Don&#8217;t you think so, Princess?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Princess looks convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand!　I will support the brave party now, just as Ned-sama says!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For better or worse, the pure princess is easily persuaded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius looks at me with a blank stare as I feel like I&#8217;ve finished a job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;.. are still a first-class talker, as ever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well. My motto is to help others. Being a good talker is an essential skill.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius frowned. As if to say he didn&#8217;t want to be in the same space as me anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But &#8230;&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s time for me to walk away too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I remain in the royal castle, I&#8217;m likely to get tangled up with troublesome people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess, may I ask you to deliver a few messages?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure! To whom?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The General Secretary. I happened to meet a guy who runs a printing business on my last trip. He&#8217;s got a pretty big factory, so if you think he might be interested, tell him to contact me later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I Understand!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And tell the Cardinal to go to the West Ward Alms Clinic. He&#8217;s been unwell for the last six months, hasn&#8217;t he?　I&#8217;ve found him to be a good doctor. Tell him it&#8217;s a referral from me and he&#8217;ll see him straight away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be sure to tell him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I’ve done the rest aside from meeting the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;&#8230;as usual you&#8217;re all about other people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all just errands I&#8217;ve run along the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I handed Julius the letter I had in my pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also need a favour from you. Give this to the members of the 『Stardust Light』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a farewell letter to my former comrades.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, I wouldn&#8217;t take this stuff. I&#8217;ll throw it right away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius says with a nasty smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll ask the princess for this too&#8230;&#8230;A-aa it would be easier if Julius gave it to her.&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it! I will send it for Ned-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Princess said with a twinkle in her eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius&#8217; face turns indignant and angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Damn, that&#8217;s the thing&#8230;..! That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t like about you&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Julius placed the letter inside the armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess looks a little disappointed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, do it swiftly. This whole thing has made me hate the kings and nobles of this country, but I don&#8217;t hate you that much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I hate you!!!”</span></p>
