<h3>Chapter 1 - The Hero Party Selection Exam.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through repeated meetings, we were able to work out the details of the test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it was not only me, May and Rushia also took part in the meetings. In the end, His Majesty the King and many other nobles discussed the contents of the test, the funds and environment that had to be prepared accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having shaken off the dark clouds that had been hanging over it for years with the defeat of the poisonous demon dragon, the country is now generous in its investment in the future. The budget is spent accordingly and the workload of the nobles has increased dramatically, but everyone was looking forward to the birth of the hero party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, two months later, on the day of the examinations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many candidates  had gathered in the square in front of the Royal Castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; roughly, seventy parties?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Enuvidia had been telling the world for more than a month that it was officially recruiting Hero parties. As a result, seventy-four parties gathered here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The number of candidates is comparable to the selection tests in other countries, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, it does.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a corner of the square, looking at the assembled parties, May next to me replied awkwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, are you nervous?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O–of course I am! The selection of the hero party is the most important thing for the future of our country! And yet, I never thought that a young girl like me would be the director&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s proof that Rushia trusts you. You&#8217;re in good hands, director.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, this examination was held at Rushia&#8217;s initiative. If that were the case, it could be expected that May, Rushia&#8217;s close associate, would be in that suitable position, but it seems that&#8230;.she herself did not envisage it at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not that the king of the Kingdom of Enuvidia lacks charisma.  However, Rushia is the driving force behind the defeat of the Poisonous Demon Dragon, and had gained enormous popularity among the people in the past two months. Perhaps the king considered this current trend and put his daughter in the foreground instead of himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;they had to apply by party, We’ve got a good turnout for that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the people who have gathered and mutter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe it was Ned&#8217;s idea to recruit by party, wasn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. The most common way for countries to choose the members of the hero party is one at a time. But there&#8217;s a drawback to that. The country chooses its own members, not the&#8230;&#8230;individual, so when it comes time to form a party, there are many cases where the party member’s ideas clash. So, although it&#8217;s not very publicly known, sometimes the members of a hero party don&#8217;t get on well with each other.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, the Kingdom of Enuvidia recruited not just one hero, but a party of heroes. Many of them may not have been able to apply because of this requirement to join forces with others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, a companion is not something that can be casually accepted with an [I understand] when told by the state to [team up with this person]. It is precisely because you are fighting a tough battle that a relationship of trust with your comrades is important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that sense, finding a trustworthy companion can be said to be the zero-test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They should at least choose their own partner to have their back&#8230;..It&#8217;s easier to work together that way”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Old acquaintances understand each other&#8217;s strengths and are therefore more likely to cooperate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is dangerous to think that&#8230;..if they take their time to slowly nurture their bond. There is no guarantee that the Demon King will match the pace of humanity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking like this, I suddenly realised that May was looking at me with a smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..what&#8217;s with that face?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing&#8230;&#8230; I just knew, it was the right thing to do to get you involved in this plan. Princess Rushia’s leadership was brilliant”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Thank you], I reply appropriately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large crowd had gathered on the square. All that will be done here today is to greet the candidates and explain the first test, but the spectators are still looking at the square with excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The birth of a hero party. They would like to enjoy this historical moment for as long as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ladies and Gentlemen, you are all here today!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the candidates were leisurely watching the square next to a nervous May, Rushia appeared on the platform and greeted the candidates. In her hand, she holds a magic tool with a circular cone-shaped shape that makes her voice louder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike May, Rushia did not seem nervous. She is a younger girl than me and May, but she has royal blood in her veins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shouldn&#8217;t May be ready by now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,&#8211;yeah. I&#8217;m off now&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s a lot of spectators there, so if you say anything strange, it&#8217;s going to be bad for the reputation of the Knights of the Kingsguard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oooo, y-y–you! Why are you saying that at this time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May walked away shaking with nervousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia stands solely as the administrator, so the role of the supervisor, May, is to explain the examinations afterwards. After this, May should be the one to give instructions to the candidates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The faces of the candidates listening to Rushia&#8217;s greeting were serious. Although she may look like a young girl, Rushia has a penetrating presence that is as strong as that of a grown-up. They naturally feel their spirits lifted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Rushia&#8217;s speech, May stood up on the stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m May Ascent, the director of these examinations!　First of all, let me explain the content of the exam!　The schedule, as previously announced, will last for five days, including today..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s voice was a little shaky, but she still fulfilled her role admirably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Watching May frantically giving instructions, I can&#8217;t help but smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like fun, doesn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long, Rushia approached me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you know anyone here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not a single one that I&#8217;ve seen&#8230;..that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the faces of the candidates, I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One of these guys is going to be the hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, looking at the assembled faces, I can&#8217;t imagine who will be the heroes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that is how it is with heroes. A suitable person suddenly appears from an unexpected place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s interesting. People&#8217;s potential is unpredictable, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. Once again, I would like to thank you. This selection test would not have been possible without your cooperation. I am really grateful&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. I get paid for it&#8230;&#8230;and also it’s my own kind of hobby.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This still leaves me with plenty of money. I took the job on top of that because I thought I&#8217;d enjoy it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me like this, Rushia showed a little thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. The first round of interviews, would you like to participate as an interviewer?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu! You have confidence in your ability to see people, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the line I had said to the dragonised Rushia before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t deny those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I affirmed, Rushia smiled as brightly as the sun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well, then, I will now conduct the first round of interviews!』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May was chewing grandly.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The venue for the first examination was a villa owned by the royal family of the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it is a villa and owned by the royal family, the exterior and interior are both luxurious. After passing through the well-kept gardens and entering the mansion, candidates can see a long corridor and a number of examiners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examinees were led to the hall at the end of the corridor and instructed to wait there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the order in which the candidates  arrived, they were given wooden number cards by the examiners. The party whose number is called is led to a private room where they are likely to be interviewed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alex.” (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">アレック</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as they receive their number cards, their peers call out their names.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, many of the candidates who had been waiting around turned to look at him. Feeling uncomfortable with all the piercing stares, the red-haired young man sighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t call me names, Rygan. We&#8217;ll stand out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ライガン</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha! When you&#8217;re a Class A adventurer, the fame tax is ridiculous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one laughing boldly was Alex&#8217;s party member called Rygan. There are two other members of the party right beside him. Everyone was nervous, but only Rygan seemed unconcerned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure you want me to be your assistant for the interview?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I&#8217;ve known you the longest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first round of interviews takes place in each party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only two candidates can enter: the leader of the party and his assistant. Basically, the leader will be the only one to answer questions. The assistant is asked to provide only supplementary explanations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex has been active as an adventurer in the Kingdom of Enuvidia since he was a child. After becoming a Class A adventurer after 15 years, he became famous for a while under the name Alex the Red-Haired, and then, another six months later, he moved to another country to broaden his activities.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan had been a fellow adventurer since he was a young boy, even before Alex became a Class A adventurer. Therefore, they knew each other well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no better person to accompany him than someone who he knows well. Rygan&#8217;s optimistic attitude was also encouraging to Alex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I&#8217;m really surprised. I heard you were adventuring across the sea, but you suddenly came back to this country, and your first words to me after meeting me for a long time was 『Let&#8217;s become a heroic party!』 So this is why.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s enough of that&#8230;&#8230;How many times are you going to tell me the same thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s how surprised I was.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat happily, Rygan says. But Alec lowered his gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Rygan. I&#8217;m telling you now, I have a prediction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex said in a small voice so that the others could not hear him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Kingdom of Enuvidia was late in dispatching a hero party because of the mess with the poisonous demon dragons. So many people, including us, thought that this country would not dispatch a hero party. As a result, the leading warriors in this country started to aspire to a different path from being the Hero Party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex speaks in a hushed voice. Rygan listened in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-class adventurer Riese Von Aldiana is a good example. If it weren&#8217;t for the poisonous demon dragons, she would surely have become the country&#8217;s hero. But she is now the leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, and she is in a position to organise her subordinates. She has already borne a heavy responsibility, and she can no longer be a hero.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..So in short, you&#8217;re glad your original rivals disappeared across the board?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. It&#8217;s a shameful story, though&#8230;&#8230;.Unfortunately, the current Kingdom of Enuvidia does not have the immediate strength to match the heroic parties of other countries. This examination, it seems that they are recruiting from other countries as well&#8230;. but it will be the same either way. Most promising people have already been recruited by other countries.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, inviting someone with no connection to the Kingdom of Enuvidia to join the heroic party is unlikely to attract support from the people. The applicants probably understand this. So, basically, it is rare for people from other countries to respond to the recruitment process for a hero party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This country is slow on the uptake. If they search for a hero, men and women now, using the same criteria as other countries, they will not be able to find them. So, inevitably, they have no choice but to lower the difficulty of the examinations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s logical, it&#8217;s a bit of a letdown that the first test is just an interview. Rather than cut the candidates in half with a difficult examination, they don&#8217;t want to lose as many potential candidates as possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s how it is. and because of the Poisonous Demon Dragon, the country is economically broke. The examinations are also limited. There&#8217;s always a chance there&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan nodded, without any particular cloud on his face, and said [I see.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is sure that most of the candidates are here solely because of their admiration for the hero party. Alex, on the other hand, stood here with a realistic calculation. He feels a kind of guilt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all right, isn&#8217;t it? Luck is part of your skill.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have a bit more confidence. Maybe the hero parties in other countries have been chosen in a similar way?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Rygan is right. I should have a bit more confidence as a A-level adventurer&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seventh group, please come in!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examiner says loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number seven tag was held by Alex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. Well, if you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s a loose exam. Let&#8217;s take it easy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pushed by Rygan&#8217;s words, Alex entered the private room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sunlight shone through the large window opposite. Against the window, five men and women were seated. The silver-haired girl in the centre is Rushia＝Enuvidia, the kingdom&#8217;s princess. To her right sits a blue-haired knight who seems to be supervising the examinations. Further to her right sits the Prime Minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting to the left of Princess Rushia was a young man with dark hair&#8230;&#8230;.[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Who is that young man?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]　Alex doesn’t recognise him. He is not in the shape of a man who makes his living fighting, so even if he were an adventurer, he would be of a low rank. But he is too young to be a nobleman active at the heart of the country, like the Prime Minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To the left of the young man &#8211; a beautiful girl with brown hair was sitting next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now we will begin the interview.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia  announces the start of the interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Alex&#8217;s eyes were glued not to Rushia, but to the girl sitting on the further left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;It can’t be!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shaky voice spills out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan, standing next to Alex, looks worried at the confused look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi&#8230;..oi. What&#8217;s wrong Alex?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, nothing. Nevermind &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex shakes his head, but cold sweat is dripping from his forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“According to your papers, you seem to be a Class A adventurer. Alex the Red-Haired&#8230;..a name has reached my ears. Despite having an existence power of 4, you’re very good on your feet, and I hear that you do more than your existence power can measure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230;..I am honoured”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex bowed deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other party is a princess of a country. It is natural to show courtesy. However, when Alex&#8217;s head was bowed in a somewhat awkward motion, it looked as if fear, apart from courtesy, was hanging over him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next to you is a B-level adventurer, Rygan, isn&#8217;t it? Are the two of you partying now because you&#8217;re from the same academy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Alex has chosen me to be his companion and assistant for this party! I will do my best to live up to his expectations and trust!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan answered in a cheerful tone of voice to the question posed by May, the examiner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was bold and direct, as is typical of an adventurer. The impression seemed to be a good one for May, who smiled softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards, the brown-haired girl sitting on the far left opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alex-san, it seems that you were active as an adventurer in the Republic of Mystein until last month. What kind of request do you mainly make and take at that time?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">マイスタイン共和国</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex&#8217;s eyes are flustered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A nasty sweat breaks out.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Calm down, this is an interview. I have to answer the questions.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, for the most part, I was commissioned to take down monsters. So I&#8217;m confident in my prowess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. You continued to hone your skills in the Republic, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brown-haired girl&#8217;s lips were pursed in satisfaction as Alex replied with a twitchy smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Alex&#8217;s frustration did not disappear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s silence──her eyes, which seemed to see through everything was unbearable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.No. I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8230;that was a lie.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if driven by something, Alex corrected his words in a shaky voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to him, Rygan&#8217;s eyes widened. But Alex&#8217;s mouth does not stop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The truth is, while I was in the Republic, I hardly had any adventures and lived a disordered life every&#8230;.day. I never thought that this country would be recruiting a hero party, so when I heard about the &#8230;&#8230; recruitment, I trained up in a big hurry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl, who had been silent, opened her mouth again and nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chills that had been swirling in Alex&#8217;s back chest fizzled out. But instead, he was left with the guilt that he had done something irreparable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex does not remember about the interview that followed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing he knew, he was leaving the room with Rygan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alex!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex was walking down the corridor in a daze when Rygan grabbed him by the chest and slammed him against the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the other candidates turned their attention to Alex and the others. But Rygan&#8217;s anger was not appeased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn you! Why did you go to the trouble of making such a disadvantageous comment! It was like you were asking to be dropped yourself!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan&#8217;s words are absolutely right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why Alec decided to talk about the situation in a very abrupt manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;WinrynーThemis was there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ウィンリーン＝テミス</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex said with a pallid look on his face, and Rygan&#8217;s brow creased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who’s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the Republic, everyone knows her name&#8230;..She, who is endowed with the blessings of the God of Judgement, sees through all lies. I knew that a bad deception would be of no consequence.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan rolled his eyes. Alex&#8217;s grip on his chest weakens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s no wonder he&#8217;s astonished. The ability to see through lies, the sheer magnitude of it, is something that even Rygan can imagine. With such power, every contract and negotiation would be advantageous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible &#8230;&#8230;Winryn-Themis is a person who has decided to spend her whole life in a long, quiet, idyllic village, refusing even the solicitations of kings, popes and great merchants. How did she get here&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex, who had completely lost his cool, muttered, terribly upset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, small footsteps approached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you alright? If you don&#8217;t feel well, I&#8217;ll go and find a doctor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl in pure white armour called out to Alec.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex lifted his pallid face and put up a bluff as best he could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; No, thanks. More importantly,is that armour from&#8230;..『White Dragon Chivalric Order』?　Why are you here in the exam hall &#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s because we&#8217;re guarding this place!　From the first exam to the final exam, we&#8217;ll be guarding everything!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl continued, [If you&#8217;re not sick, I&#8217;ll go back to my postー” and left the place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex and Rygan watch the girl&#8217;s back with puzzled eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, Oi&#8230;..it&#8217;s true that the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 is the kingdom&#8217;s leading adventurer party, but they&#8217;ve been very bold to hire them. Since this kingdom and the Adventurers&#8217; Guild are independent, hiring them wouldn&#8217;t be free of charge&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rygan mutters in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s too late now, but&#8230;&#8230;the current perceptions must be changed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex says, somewhat in awe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This country, more than any other, is seriously trying to create a hero party&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The examiners leave the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a small breath as I listened to the sound of footsteps moving away.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, it is supposed to be something like this&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The candidates were from different backgrounds, but there were three main categories. They were either adventurers, kingdom knights or others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of them did not aspire to be a hero. Regardless of the circumstances of the candidates, the majority of them had some kind of achievement. Therefore, there were many examinees who knew their names even if they did not know each other. The red-haired Alex, who had just left this room, was one of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am sorry to the candidates, but so far I have not been able to pinpoint anyone. I may not have the right to say that, having given up on being a hero man, but I am proud to say that I have a good eye for people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia, this concludes the morning session.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay! Everyone, take a short break!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia  nodded in a cheerful voice at May&#8217;s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of the five interviewers relaxed their shoulders. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Don’t mind if I do] as I lightly straighten my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned=Wolkinter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man sitting next to May approached me and called out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was an old but dignified man. His hair was dark brown and his forehead was exposed by lifting his fringes. The wrinkles on his face were as brave as if they were proof of his accumulated achievements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I haven&#8217;t said hello yet. I am Galba＝Stellen, the Prime Minister.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ガルバ＝ステルレン</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am Ned=Wolkinter..I apologise for the delay in greeting you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I had jumped into this interview at Rushia&#8217;s suggestion. Therefore, I had not yet exchanged greetings with the Prime Minister, but from what I saw during the interview&#8230;..he seemed to be a friendly person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have heard of your exploits, Ned-tono. It seems that you led the『White Dragon Chivalric Order』to the aid of Her Highness in the recent battle against the Poisonous Demon Dragon. In the newspapers, Her Highness and the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 were praised as if they were the greatest contributors, but in fact it was you who did it, wasn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s lifting the stone too much. It was the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 and May and Princess Rushia  here who actually slayed the Poisonous Demon Dragon&#8230;..or rather, who did you hear such a story from?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This mistress/concubine!/ It is I!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL:As I previously mentioned on Vol1, Rushia calls herself 妾. It can be Mistress/Concubine/I/Me. Author didn’t put the hiragana so, it can be all option.) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia  proudly puffed out her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[You] I mutter inwardly. There are only a limited number of people who know the full story of that battle, but Rushia, who was involved, would certainly be able to tell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I let out an involuntary sigh, Prime Minister Galba smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-tono, I would like you to keep your tone towards me simple. As it is, it makes me seem more respected than Her Highness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely there could be a problem of appearance if I keep this up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s change to a frank attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.You, you always do similar things wherever you are”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I heard a girl&#8217;s voice from behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, I saw a neat and clean-looking girl with straight brown hair down, smiling good-naturedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is the one I invited for this occasion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Winryn, it&#8217;s been a long time. I&#8217;m glad you agreed to come on such short notice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a call from Ned-san, of all people. Of course,I&#8217;ll answer from the ends of the earth.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;don&#8217;t ever say that line in the Republic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winryn said with a gentle smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her ability to spot lies, Winryn is immensely charismatic in the Republic. If she were to say that she would [respond from the ends of the earth], she would attract a lot of attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks like just another pretty or pathetic girl. Her smile is also innocent, but she can see through &#8230;&#8230; lies and knows a lot about people&#8217;s nasty sides. Despite her appearance, she has a tough personality.</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/p046-720x1024.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, how responsive was the blessing of the God of Judgement?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are compiling a list of those who have lied. This way.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As expected,she’s fast’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sheet of paper was handed to me with the names of several people on it. I read it silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;there are fewer than I thought there would be.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Hero Party Selection Examination is a country-wide initiative. They&#8217;re trying not to lie from the start, which could be exposed if the kingdom investigates. That&#8217;s a good thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Or did they know about Winryn  and was going to lie, but decided not to?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">]&#8230;.Well, that&#8217;s one thing I appreciate about them, they&#8217;re good at being tactful. It&#8217;s an added bonus to be good at negotiating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Winryn-tono. We are very grateful for your cooperation. If you have any problems in the future, you can contact us. This concubine/mistress/I will help you next time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Princess Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Rushia&#8217;s thanks, Winreen bowed solemnly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Ned introduces more extraordinary people now&#8230;&#8230;. Why are you following Ned, Winryn-tono?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To such a question from May, Winryn ponders a little before answering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because Ned-san never lies.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After stating simply, Winryn continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san, who cares about connecting with others, doesn&#8217;t act against anyone on a regular basis, so there&#8217;s no need to lie in the first place&#8230;..I prefer people with that kind of integrity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.that&#8217;s an exaggeration. I lie sometimes too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you do, it&#8217;s a kind lie&#8230;&#8230; to help someone, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little bit flustered with the gentle smile coming from Winryn while scratching the back of my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to do. It&#8217;s a very uplifting day for the Prime Minister and for Winryn Themis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;As I said before, you must never utter such lines in the Republic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winryn smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am sure she means what she says. But it is also true that she is teasing me. A faint hint of mischievous mischievousness shone through Winryn&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there something wrong with that line?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answer May&#8217;s question, which sounds somewhat fluent and carefree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The day Winryn, who has the blessing of the God of Judgement, says,『This person never lies』, she was treated like a saint. I&#8217;m glad there are no Republicans here&#8230;.right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure Winryn is aware of the time and place, so I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s paying attention. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For those who are told to do so, it is a cold sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san doesn&#8217;t seem to be very good at attracting attention either&#8230;..so why don&#8217;t you come and live with me? It&#8217;s a nice, quiet place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Is that a joke?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, who knows…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chuckling, Winryn smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one in this world knows what she really thinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia watched such an exchange between me and Winryn with a complicated look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a feeling that&#8230;.Ned could live richer than this mistress if he wanted to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think so. Even if I did get a good status, I&#8217;d soon be out of it. There&#8217;s not much I can do for myself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;..I feel like you could be anything you want to be&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a matter of imagination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least I couldn&#8217;t be a hero.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, shouldn&#8217;t you be eating by now? Time is finite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s true. Then, once and for all, disperse!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Prime Minister Galba&#8217;s suggestion, Rushia nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of us leaves the room. Just before I did so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winryn called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you already know, my blessings are not universal. In very rare cases, there are things that can nullify my blessings, so&#8230;..beware.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand&#8230;&#8230; surely, we should be on the lookout for special armaments?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. The blessing of the God of Inquiry falls under the highest level of blessings, so it cannot be broken by the same blessing. It is also clear from the Republic&#8217;s research that there is no magic in existence that can nullify this blessing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; The more I hear about it, the more outrageous the blessing is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still, it can be broken by some special armaments, so it&#8217;s not&#8230;..invincible, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Humility, or rather, concern for us. The selection of a hero party is a national policy. Failure to do so could, at worst, plunge many of us into the depths of misery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger that&#8230;.Well, we&#8217;re not going to rely on Winryn to do everything for us. We&#8217;ll look into it if they look suspicious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, that possibility was factored in from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, after the interview I&#8217;m going to do one more job.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first round of examinations, afternoon session, will now begin!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May’s voice echoed through the hall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nervousness of the candidates is completely dissipated, probably due to the many announcements they had made in front of so many people in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The interviewers are also getting used to this job. The afternoon session will run more smoothly than the morning</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I see.you&#8217;ve been active as a B-level adventurer for a long time. You must have already earned enough money, so what&#8217;s your motivation for wanting to be part of the heroes party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That, of course, is because I want to help more people!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young adventurer answered Prime Minister Galba&#8217;s question with a vivid and lively reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have heard similar answers countless times already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the interview was over, the adventurer bowed deeply and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then another candidate comes in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──So, can you tell me what you think you are better than the other candidates?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I said earlier, I served a lord as a knight in the provinces. However, I have given up my title as a knight in order to take this examination. I hope you will appreciate my resolve.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A well-dressed, mature man announces that he is ready for the job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the interviewers exchange pleasantries, a young man standing next to the man raises his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As his assistant, let me add one point about him. He has not only a passionate determination, but also a calm and collected mind. He assesses the battle situation instantly and retreats once he realises that he cannot win. He also has the strength to retreat when the time comes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing this explanation, Lucilla said, [Hmmm].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230;..if you find yourself in a situation where you know you can&#8217;t win the battle, but if you don&#8217;t fight, people you care about will die, what will you do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s quite a nasty question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I am interested to see how he would answer this question.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Lloyd would probably say&#8230;&#8230;[You&#8217;re a hero and you&#8217;re allowed to run away?] Yea, I can just imagine that word coming from him’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lloyd in my head told me this with a scowl. That man would say that line as a genuine question, without any calculations about getting an interview or anything like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But people like that are in the minority.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Anyway, I&#8217;ll try to avoid such situations on a regular basis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mature man in front of me gave an uninteresting &#8230;&#8230;but definite answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The interview is over and the men leave the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phew&#8230;..we&#8217;ve only got a few more to go. I&#8217;m getting tired.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;d be tired too if the examiner said that to us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuu&#8230;. oh, you&#8217;re being so mean,&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But perhaps taking it as a good argument, May straightened her back and regained her nerve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but wonder how May feels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a series of interviews, it is clear that everyone has the same point of view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knight I mentioned earlier is no exception. I&#8217;ve heard so many appeals for resolve that I&#8217;ve got calluses in my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The size of your resolve doesn&#8217;t affect your reputation that much. The unwavering determination that is demonstrated at the last minute&#8230;&#8230;and the foolhardiness that emerges from it are, after all, the result of daily training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What matters is the daily effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, the next candidate visits the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a blonde girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Seren Duvalis . Nice to meet you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recognised the name and looked at the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the person Riese had said and quoted as a strong candidate. In the Kingdom of Enuvidia, she is the second most famous adventurer after Riese. Rushia, May and the Prime Minister also appear to have been caught off guard by Seren&#8217;s appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her presence power is 5. Although she is one step behind Riese, she is one of the best fighters in the Kingdom of Enuvidia. She is only 17 years old, but her face shows no sign of slackness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came into the room alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you not have any assistants&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have been alone in this examination from the very beginning. That&#8217;s not a breach of protocol, is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The interviewers, including me, looked at each other as Seren asked in a strong tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not a breach of protocol, but she appears to be somewhat overconfident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this exam, we recruited candidates on a party basis. This means that if they pass, they will work in that party. At least we won&#8217;t be looking for additional people. If Seren passes, she will go on her own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren, perhaps seeing through my state of mind, told me sharply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In other countries, there is a pattern of a hero working alone. As long as I am competent, I should have no problem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she said that caught me off guard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, there is a pattern, but&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s an existence force of seven.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get there eventually.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re ambitious, but are you going to walk a tightrope all the way until you reach that point? If you&#8217;re not strong enough, you have the option of relying on your friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s an opinion that only you, a man who can only rely on his friends, could have.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The air was tense with thorny words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, this girl named Seren&#8230;.. knows me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As the name&#8230;..Hero Party suggests, this one is designed to be taken by a party. You&#8217;ll be at a disadvantage in future exams if you&#8217;re alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have not fallen so far as to be dictated by people like you.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL:Oooooooo)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren&#8217;s comment was met with a raised eyebrow from May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you had listened to yourself earlier, you would know that you’re being very overbearing. Such an attitude is inappropriate for a hero representing this country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem. I have my own personal feelings about that man there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren glares at me sharply with her eyes flashing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the thorns that Seren has been releasing since a while ago are directed only at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;..have you done something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.No, I have no idea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure why, but the way Seren looked at me was unusually severe. It looks as if she is interviewing me to kill me right here and now, rather than to become a brave warrior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am good at remembering people&#8217;s names and episodes with them. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sure. I have never met this girl, Seren, face to face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once again, there should be no breach of protocol&#8230;.. any misgivings you may be feeling, I will dispel them in the examination that follows.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She started to speak out of the blue, but doesn&#8217;t she think we&#8217;re going to drop her from the interview?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The interview with Seren was then led by Rushia, the Prime Minister and Winryn. I seem to be disliked by Seren, and May doesn&#8217;t have a very good opinion of her. The interview proceeded in an awkward atmosphere, but Seren, as she had said earlier, conversed with everyone but me in a confident manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Seren eventually left the room, May let out an uncharacteristic exhale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite a peculiar person, wasn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May says with a complicated expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m more bewildered than irritated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did she hate me so much&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why was I being so openly hostile?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She didn&#8217;t lie, by the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.didn&#8217;t want to hear that information.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh at Winryn&#8217;s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad to see that she&#8217;s so open and honest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if anything comes up, we can look into it further&#8230;..Rushia. Was the next one the last?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu. Keep up the good work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People who aspire to be a hero cannot be mediocre. We are also prepared for the fact that they are unique and have strong habits. But no matter how strong their habits are, for them, as the candidates, this examination is their one chance. We have to be very aware of that fact and conduct the exam carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a knock at the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Prime Minister Galba replied [Come in], the door opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me ──owww!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl appeared from behind the door and fell, hitting her face on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence reigned the place&#8230;&#8230;This is another appearance with quite an impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..are you alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiyaa!!! It&#8217;s all right!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to her, the girl stood up vigorously. Tears were pooling in the corners of her eyes and her face was bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A grey-haired young man enters the room from behind the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These two seem to be the leader and the assistant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, I&#8217;m Alice Feldrant! Pleased to meet you!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">アリス＝フェルドラント</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl had bluish-black hair that reached down to her calves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair is very long, but it does not look filthy. Her hair is silky and shiny and shakes smoothly when the girl moves her body. Her skin is white and her face is young but well-defined. Compared to Rushia, she is taller, but rather petite, with a slender body. According to her papers, she is 16 years old.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall impression of her is that she is full of shyness. Because of her very long fringes, Alice&#8217;s eyes were hidden when she moved slightly. She is afraid of the gaze of others and does not make eye contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Exzair</span><span style="font-weight: 400">＝</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sullivan, her assistant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">エクスゼール＝サリバン</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A grey-haired young man standing next to Alice bowed politely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The leader is Alice, and her assistant seems to be this man, Exzair. It&#8217;s a strange party, a little &#8230;&#8230; strange, although it feels the other way round if I just look at the attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice Feldrant&#8230;&#8230; I can feel an indescribable presence from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Let’s start the interview now&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Rushia took one look at Alice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. you could relax a little more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice turns red up to her ears and turns her head downwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“According to your papers&#8230;..Alice, you were an adventurer in the Kingdom of Enuvidia, but moved to the Amdo Empire a year ago. Why did you go to the Empire?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, uh, it has to do with why I, uh, became an adventurer&#8230;..I was saved by Rin The Brave a long time ago.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">リン</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin The Brave is a hero from the Republic of Mystein. He is now, I believe, around 20 years old and has already achieved a number of accomplishments, and is a hero of both name and substance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I became an adventurer because I was saved by Rin the Brave, and I wished I could help people like him. I heard that the Hero Rin was in the Empire at that time. I thought that maybe I could meet him, but I couldn&#8217;t in the end, so I spent my time as a normal adventurer in the Empire.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is quite a dramatic upbringing that she became a hero because she was saved by a hero. When I cast a light glance at Winryn, who was sitting next to me, she shook her head quietly. It seems she is not lying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;So it was because of Rin the Brave&#8217;s influence that you took the exam this time?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“y,yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice nodded nervously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the motivation is known, I check Alice&#8217;s documents again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The power of existence is&#8230;&#8230;5, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself.  Another thing worth mentioning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her competence is at the level of Seren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason she is not as well known as Seren is probably because she has spent the last year in the Amdo Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little curious about Alice, so I decided to ask her a question too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you get your existential power up to this level?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Well, um, that&#8217;s, you know, fighting monsters normally, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All by yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. By myself. Back then, I didn&#8217;t have parties like I do now&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a bold way of life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She does not seem to have a very bold temperament, but she’s in the same league as Seren?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“一Were you obsessed with fighting alone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, it&#8217;s not like that. &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice replies with some difficulty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just that&#8230;&#8230;I didn&#8217;t have many friends&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.I see”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least she didn&#8217;t seem to have the same personality as Seren, who pursued strength as an individual. The reason that he has no friends is still more convincing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;ve only partnered up after you&#8217;ve increased your presence? &#8230;&#8230;Then, how did you get into the party with your assistant there, Exzair?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I met Exzair-san at the Adventurers Guild of the Amdo Empire. After I had completed a few requests, he asked me if I wanted to take on a quest with him. We hit it off&#8230;..and decided to work together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although they hit it off, they don&#8217;t seem to be very close. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if seeing through my state of mind, Exzair opens his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much a match as it is a conflict of interest. I wanted a strong vanguard, and Alice wanted an ally to provide logistical support.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded [I see] at Exzair&#8217;s addition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatever it is, a presence of five is worthy of recognition. How did you manage to train so well on your own?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no! I just happen to be strong&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At May&#8217;s words, Alice was overly modest.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Her attitude&#8230;..’I&#8217;ve been wondering about it since a while ago…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From &#8230;&#8230; what I&#8217;ve seen so far, you seem a little timid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prime Minister Galba spoke in a calm state of mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice apologised, her blank face turning blue. He is pointing out that attitude&#8230;..Her personality is not suitable to become a hero, even if it is flattering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For example&#8230;&#8230;suppose you are a hero and you have to take on a battle you can&#8217;t win.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prime Minister Galba says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is another example &#8230;&#8230; of a nasty question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it may be the best question to find out about Alice&#8217;s character.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Situations can be anything&#8230;&#8230;Well, let&#8217;s say there are civilians being attacked by a monster. You are the only one who can protect them. But the monster is strong and you don&#8217;t stand a chance. What will you do then? &#8230;&#8230;Do you fight or do you run away?&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ee?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice uttered an unfamiliar voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is something wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, no, no, it&#8217;s not a big deal&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alice says, turning her previously averted eyes straight at us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a hero, but can you run away&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said that &#8211; all the interviewers, including me, were surprised.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first round of interviews of the Hero Party Selection Examination has been completed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now&#8230;.we will now consider who to pass!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia says with a big smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve got a lot of famous non-adventurers here. Mirei the Wind Dancer, who is active all over the world as a wandering entertainer. Lux, a moving fortress who leads a vigilante group on the frontier. Fusen, the Green Shadow, a survivalist who lives as a hunter in the Devil&#8217;s Forest. Fina, an expert in fighting and cooking, uses Ironfire Spear. And Heisen, a scholar on grimoire studies. I was surprised that&#8230;&#8230;scholars had applied, but as long as they are competent, it doesn&#8217;t matter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, Ned is right. We should make decisions with as few preconceptions as possible. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia agreed with me as I said this while rolling up the papers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that even students from the Royal Academy are applying to the Duke&#8217;s Vanhardt Knights. Incidentally, Kingsguard knights like May can also take the examinations, but they prioritise their loyalty to the royal family thus they refuse to participate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are a few wizards, but&#8230;..this isn&#8217;t a problem, is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia nodded cheerfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, our country lags behind in the research of magic. But, because of our national friendship with dragons, we have a thriving monster industry!　In particular, the number of special armaments made from monster materials is probably one of the highest in the world!&#8230;..Our country&#8217;s strength is not magic, but special armaments. Of course, I don&#8217;t mean to deny magic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some kingdoms in the world are known for their magical powers. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the Kingdom of Enuvidia is a specially armed powerhouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special armaments are weapons made from monster materials, and as the name suggests, they have special abilities. In particular, some special armaments are equipped with skills, which have even more special effects than normal special armaments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a point to discuss with you. Thanks to&#8230;&#8230; Winryn, I know which candidates are lying. However, this mistress&#8230;..does not think it is necessary to reject them for this alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Highness, I agree with that opinion. The brave party is also involved in the politics of the country and will eventually come to the negotiating table. &#8230;&#8230; Lie is necessary in matters of negotiation. If I may speak from the prime minister&#8217;s point of view, I wouldn&#8217;t want to entrust a brave man to someone who is not very good at integrity and who doesn&#8217;t understand politics.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia nodded her head in agreement with the Prime Minister&#8217;s unique opinion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The highest power of presence is 5? I would have preferred 6, but&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t see a problem with it. Seren and Alice, with an existence of 5, are both young. If they&#8217;re going to be heroes in the future, they&#8217;ll definitely move up to 6. 7 is special so I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I give my thoughts to May, who speaks up while looking at the documents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want the heroes who represent the country to eventually reach an existential power of 6 or higher. So we need to pick someone who is both strong and growing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alice=Feldrant&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prime Minister Galba muttered with a finger to his chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A person with Existence  Power 5. That girl was also, after all, unique, for better or worse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8230;..I don&#8217;t mean to be sceptical about this, but is she really Existence Power 5? It’s good but she didn&#8217;t look like it&#8230;.honestly, she looked unreliable to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agree with what May said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The timidity that comes across just by talking to her. Throughout the interview, she behaved like a small animal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least, my blessing hasn&#8217;t responded, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winryn also tells me anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know much about adventurers, but I&#8217;ve been told that, depending on one&#8217;s ingenuity, one&#8217;s powers of existence can be greater than one&#8217;s ability. Whether it&#8217;s defeating a higher-ranked monster by setting multiple traps or getting help from stronger comrades&#8230;.She could be one of those hands.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The argument from Prime Minister Galba is also undeniable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said she was raising her power alone, so there seems to be no reason that she relied on her companions, but there are many other ways to do it. Setting traps is not a problem in itself, but if the means used are too limited, she may not be useful in a real battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reminded Alice once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her skin was so pure white you could almost see her veins through it, and her body was small and thin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a frightened demeanour and a very mature appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just by looking at her, you wouldn&#8217;t even think she was an adventurer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was also surprised by her last answer. [You&#8217;re a hero, but can you run away]&#8230;&#8230;In a bad way, the word sounds like thoughtlessness&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That statement took everyone by surprise, but it is certainly understandable that it could be taken that way. However–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean you&#8217;ve stopped thinking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my head, I think of a man and I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“[Always strive on a daily basis to win any battle, whenever and however it comes.] Maybe it&#8217;s a sign of that kind of preparedness&#8230;&#8230;.I know at least one guy is like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are people in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People who think like that, as if it were natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have to choose carefully.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttering this, May quietly looked over the documents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, what we are choosing now is a hero. A hero is a human being, but one who is beyond human knowledge. It is impossible to select them only on the basis of logic. The only way is for each of us to meet face to face and discuss based on our values and senses.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Come to think of it, that man who is&#8230;&#8230;Alice&#8217;s assistant didn&#8217;t make any remarkable remarks.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Assistants are inherently involved in the interview process to assist the leader. But few of them ever defend that role in a ridiculously honest way. In most parties, the Assistants lifted their leader whenever the opportunity arose. And they tried to increase their chances of passing the interview as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that man, Exzair, really only said the minimum necessary to assist Alice. The two of them could have gone in for the interview together, but they didn&#8217;t make the most of that feature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are they not very keen on this examination?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or did he become an assistant for some other purpose?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I am approached by Winryn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn around and she hands me a document.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also have a list here for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The blessing didn&#8217;t respond, but it&#8217;s a list of people who I personally thought were suspicious&#8230;.I&#8217;ve seen so many people, so I&#8217;m proud that I&#8217;m still a sharp intuition”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several names were mentioned on the list. It was not my intention to ask for so much, but apparently Winryn  voluntarily did the work she felt was necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This helps&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s almost the same as the list I made”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you make it too, Net-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people on it myself. I told you at lunch break, didn&#8217;t I? I&#8217;m not going to solely rely on Winryn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then showed Winryn the list of suspicious people I had jotted down during the interview.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winryn&#8217;s eyes widened. Our list was almost ninety percent the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Winryn is by far the most charismatic person in the Republic. With her endorsement like that, I&#8217;m willing to trust this list.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia. As planned, it&#8217;s time for me to proceed to the next plan, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu. I&#8217;m counting on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the two lists, I left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Winryn&#8217;s help, candidates who had lied in a way that could be detected would have been identified in the interview.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here onwards, I must uncover the candidates who have lied in a way that cannot be detected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now let&#8217;s deal with the uninvited guests.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are risks associated with the Hero Party Selection Test.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we are recruiting candidates on such a large scale. Among the candidates, there must be agents from other countries. As Prime Minister Galba said earlier, the relationship between the hero&#8217;s party and politics is inseparable. In other words, the deeper you get into the matter of the heroes, the easier it is to get political information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My job from now on is to get rid of those agents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rented a guest room in the castle and spread out all the communication stones in my pouch on the table.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.Winryn&#8217;s blessing of the God of Judgement is extremely powerful.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why her name is quite known in the Republic.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s rare to find a special weapon that can nullify that blessing. If someone has brought something that is rare and valuable into this country&#8230;.it is almost certain that information has leaked out.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if the information is leaking, I should be able to find out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put two written documents on the table.The list I drew up and the list Winryn drew up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hastily prepared lie was spotted by Winryn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From this point on, the meticulously planned lies must be exposed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The enemy is the candidates who intended to lie from the start. Moreover, it is an opponent who has taken the trouble to take measures against the ability to detect lies, such as the blessing of the God of Judgement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words &#8211; there is definitely a malicious intent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its malevolence has bare its fangs as early as today.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, the person I should rely on this time is&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know I don&#8217;t have any special skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I always need someone to help me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s almost like choosing the best one from a myriad of cards in my hand, but I have to remember that I&#8217;m choosing a person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stroke the frame of the communication stone in a clockwise direction and transmit to the contact I&#8217;m looking for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..sorry to call on such short notice. Do you have time now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person on the other end of the communication is the one who knows where all the goods are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From stationery tools to magic tools, special armaments and even national treasures, this is a man who knows everything that is circulating in this world. He is the man to turn to if I want to find out what special armaments are really out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want you to tell me about the whereabouts of special armaments that can nullify the blessings of the God of Judgement.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◇◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The city was completely quiet after nightfall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the start of the selection test for the hero party, the royal capital, which had been so lively during the day, was peaceful, as if the fatigue of the party had been healed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But a disturbing presence crosses such quiet darkness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several men in black cloaks, blending in with the darkness, were lurking in the vicinity of the military base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite a tight security, as we&#8217;d expect.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed. But there will be changes as the selection trials progress. We have a chance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These men then stared at the towering wall in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond this wall is the base of the Royal Army of Enuvidia. The Kingsguard Knights, who directly guard the royal family, are stationed at the royal castle and the rest of the standing army stays at this base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it is a military base, security is tight. However, if an event as large as the selection test for the Hero Party is to be held, the security must be directed towards that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These men wish to exploit this opportunity and break in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The exams last a week in total. We&#8217;ll find a way through before then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They’ll have to break within that timeframe or the security will be returned as usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A breakthrough should be found as soon as possible. These men, carefully observing the base..but──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, you will never find that breakthrough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing a voice from behind them, all of them turned around as one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of them took out the weapons they had been carrying hidden inside their cloaks. Swords, bow guns and knives. The men held them up  but their will to fight instantly fizzled out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s impossible&#8230;.Riese Von Aldiana&#8230;..! Why are you here?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There she was, an adventurer with a power of Existence of 6 &#8211; Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is the leader of the famous adventurer party 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The men instantly realised. ─ ─ When it comes to this battle, there is no chance for them to win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first priority is to survive. These men took a cautious look and tried to devise a plan &#8211; but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are all suspected of espionage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese calmly and matter-of-factly saw through the men&#8217;s identities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The men were overcome with agitation and continued to glare at Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be ridiculous! Where is your evidence!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do I need proof in this situation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course&#8230;.. we haven&#8217;t done anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Technically, these men haven&#8217;t done anything yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were just about to sneak into the base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what they are called by ‘in the nick of time’. As the men felt a faint sense of relief in the midst of their frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t want to bother you too much, but I&#8217;ve also been told to keep it as civil as possible, so fair enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese muttered to herself and took something out of her pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Throw throws at the man in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a communications stone. You&#8217;ll know why I threw it out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a magical tool made from a special gemstone. The man received the tool with alarm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, this is through the communication stone. Let me explain, briefly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“.. that voice, one of the interviewees?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ah, you remembered me』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uninterested, the other party to the correspondence said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They had met during the selection test. He remembers that he has a &#8230;. puzzling figure. There were five interviewers. Princess Rushia, the organiser of the selection examinations. May, the knight of the Kingsguard, who supervised the examinations. Prime Minister Galba, the King&#8217;s right-hand man and Winryn, who is immensely popular in the Republic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only one amongst these eminent faces is a dull young man who is the recipient of this correspondence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;m sorry that you applied for the test under various false information, including your identity and name but your true identities have already been revealed&#8230;&#8230;.Ionis＝Gilbert, Lagen＝Fravel and Diego＝Brazi. These are your real names』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suu??!!&#8230;.. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Did you think you wouldn&#8217;t get found out because you&#8217;re a small, elite criminal organisation?&#8230;. Six years ago, you were hired by the Bizen tax collector to take out the village chief of Kurt, who was opposed to the tax increase. You can accept it through the black market and it was also your first crime. Since then, you&#8217;ve mainly dealt with assassinations, but you&#8217;ve often complained about how little money you were making. The bar you patronise&#8230;..is the Golden Pig Pavilion, isn&#8217;t it? The waiter there was troubled by your bad manners. Time to pay your bills.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was breathtakingly shocking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the information told in fluent fluency is true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were investigated until the very detail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything──everything about them has been seen through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The client this time is a military officer of the Republic. The objective is to steal military secrets from the Kingdom of Enuvidia. You&#8217;ve even been lent a magical tool to conceal your information&#8230;..Your work is finished here. You&#8217;ll also have to give up the big reward you&#8217;re after. Of course, we&#8217;ll get your client too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh &#8230;&#8230;ugh, ah &#8230;.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the three men has a cold sweat dripping from his forehead trickling down his chin and falling to the ground. He is a man who has been in the business for a long time. The man felt that the one on the other side of the communication was more frightening than Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where and how did he so quickly find out about them?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would still be more convincing if he explained that he had dared to swim into such a situation, and that that person is now coming to catch him, sooner rather than later. But there is no reason for this man to do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Looks like the story is over. I&#8217;d appreciate it if you&#8217;d stay&#8230;..unprovoked.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man returned the communication stone to Riese as she approached, nodding his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is not the slightest intention of resistance. His heart is broken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese received the communication stone while still being wary of the men, who no longer had the strength to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the fourth one&#8230;&#8230;there’s more rats getting in than I thought..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The selection trials for the Hero are a rare, large-scale event. Even though they know they&#8217;re being watched, a lot of them don&#8217;t want to miss this opportunity.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice of Ned can be heard over the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. The enemy may be dispatching operatives with a certain degree of preparedness to throw away their lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you were very quick to gather information this time. You must have made use of your contacts as usual, but did you rely on an extraordinary partner again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I relied on the God Of Merchant to find out where the blessings and special armaments were. He&#8217;s called by that name so all of his information are always accurate.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not familiar with the world of the God Of Merchant&#8230;.but I know that alias. As I recall, he&#8217;s rumoured to be so busy that he&#8217;ll charge you money just to have a conversation with him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I used a discount coupon, so I got off cheap. I&#8217;ll have to go and pay you once the&#8230;..selection exam is over.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not the point, but&#8230;&#8230;this man is always doing extraordinary things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He calls himself an ordinary person because everyone he relies on is unique.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Riese. Sorry, but I need you to do two more similar cases for me.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem&#8230;..Fufu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Is something wrong?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. I just think that Ned has been relying on me these recent days…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Should I refrain from asking next time?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you can keep relying on me&#8230;&#8230;it makes me happy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Happy?’ Ned asked back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are a lot of people in this world who are itching to be depended on by you. I&#8217;m one of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I don&#8217;t think there are that many &#8230;&#8230; like that.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unaware or&#8230;&#8230;still a guilty man”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese was about to say: [You&#8217;re going to get stabbed one day, you know?] but stopped herself from saying it, thinking that it would be better to keep it as a secret and defend it by herself.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center">◆◆◆◆</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese then detained more fake hero parties. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to catch the operatives working in secret without letting them get away as far as possible, I want to avoid any conspicuous action. For this reason, I am now cooperating not with the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, but with Riese alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again, I heard from various people and were able to find out who the agents were. Armin, the bakery owner. Themis, an employee of the apothecary. Lennon the hunter. Flip, the innkeeper. Shaina, a waiter at the tavern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And &#8211; the God Of Merchant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among merchants, he is revered as a god. His personal history, in which he developed a small general shop inherited from his parents into the world&#8217;s largest trading house and opened a large number of shops at home and abroad, has now been written about and disseminated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man whose schedule is packed to the minute for the next 20 years, but when I asked him, he cooperated more readily than I had expected. He told me [you&#8217;re special] but what did he mean by that? It might have something to do with the discount coupons I&#8217;m getting.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘So that&#8217;s one case left. &#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look out of the window while lightly straightening my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The completely darkened streets of the royal city were quiet, time was moving gently like drifting clouds, and the lights that could be seen pocketing around gave the impression of warm human activity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The malice stirring behind the shadows was being dealt with by me and Riese in a nonchalant manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Net.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear Riese&#8217;s voice coming from the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my gaze back to the table again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s not a big deal, but I thought I&#8217;d report it just in case. About the last set of candidates allegedly hired by Baron&#8230;&#8230;are not where they were supposed to be.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re missing? Their aim was to sabotage the exam, so I assumed they were setting something up near the second exam venue, but&#8230;&#8230; I guess I was wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The baron&#8217;s aim is to discredit the King by failing the selection test. It is a so-called power struggle. The King is a creature that is always both respected and opposed by the country&#8217;s nobility.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Did the enemy not make a move today?&#8230;&#8230; No. The selection examinations are over in a week. There should be no room in the schedule for them either.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;ll keep an eye on the perimeter just in case.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, please do. I&#8217;ll look around a bit too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m on the administrative side of the selective examinations, so I have free access to the exam rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The candidate should have seen my face during the interviews. In other words, they must recognise me as one of the most powerful people on the interviewer side. And as such, they won&#8217;t do anything like killing me easily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went outside the royal castle and headed for the venue of the second examination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way there. A blonde girl stands in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good evening.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the night sky. The light from the street lamps illuminates the girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recognised her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Seren＝Duvalis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A person who was once known as Riese&#8217;s rival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had also met him at today&#8217;s interview and dragged something out of the alleyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this what you&#8217;re looking for?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then rolled the object she was dragging in her hand to my feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the candidates who were to be taken into custody by Riese. They are not dead because I can see they&#8217;re still twitching. They are just unconscious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You took them down?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. They&#8217;ve been up to no good”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren told me plainly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that these men are agents should only be known to me, Riese and Rushia and the others involved in running the selection trials at this point. In other words, Seren must have caught the men red-handed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I’m  not called the Thunder Emperor for nothing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a [pikuri], Seren shows small sparks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A user of the special armoury 《Phantom Dance of Lightning》 made from the blood and bones of the Thunder Beast Evol. &#8230;&#8230; It is said that to master that armoury, you need outstanding sense&#8230;&#8230;Hence the user must be Existence Power of 5.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..you&#8217;re quick to gather information.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren also seems to know about my special skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was contempt there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose I should have known about this before the interview.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would be a quandary to check all the candidates. I&#8217;m sorry, but there are other examiners besides you who are paying attention.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Seren looked miffed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is highly competent, but her mental age seems to be appropriate for her age.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you use&#8230;..Riese?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren asks quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, there were signs of fighting in various parts of Royal Capita. If you are the one giving the orders, it should be Riese who is following&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded [Aaa] to Seren, who seemed convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“─ ─ You did an unnecessary thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a resentful tone in her voice, Seren said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what part of the conversation she didn&#8217;t like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was you who gave Riese the weakness in the name of companionship.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were the catalyst for the creation of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』. Ned＝Wolkinter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren said with her eyes flashing sharply at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I respected Riese. I thought she would even reach one of the world&#8217;s strongest&#8230;&#8230;Existence Power 7. However, Riese has become feckless since she formed the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』. Putting her friends before herself and abandoning her obsession with strength&#8230;..Riese has lost her fangs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Seren shook herself with a wince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the past, we had meaningful conversations every time we saw each other. But since Riese met you, she&#8217;s been talking about you all the time&#8230;&#8230;!　She talks about how great Ned is and how she wants to help Ned&#8230;..! She&#8217;s always talking about you &#8230;&#8230;, instead of me, her rival!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was quietly listening to the conversation, and then I said, [Hmm?] I tilted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..are you perhaps jealous?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, haaaa??!!! Why would you think that?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I thought you were mad at me because I made you not care about Riese anymore&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pl,Please stop joking! I&#8217;m not going to let you get away with that!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren turned red in the face and shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a neighbourly nuisance at this late hour of the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A,anyway! I don&#8217;t approve of you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren breathes slowly to calm herself down and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t like the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』and I don&#8217;t like you either. &#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Seren heads back on her heels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just after the girl&#8217;s back was out of sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From behind, Riese called out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t hear what you two were talking about but it looks like you were arguing with Seren&#8230;&#8230;hmm? Are these unconscious men that we missed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will explain more about that later&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Riese. Did you maybe say some things to Seren about me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I used to talk about Ned a lot. I wanted Seren to know how great Ned is!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a big sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seren Duvalis &#8230;.. She is just, a big fan of Riese.</span></p>
