<h3>Chapter 1 - The Country that Bonded with a Dragon.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the royal castle of the Kingdom of Intail, I was walking directly through the castle town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had already decided where I was going. Out of this country. If I told the princess about this, she was likely to vehemently object, so I kept quiet when we were talking in the royal castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From here, &#8230;&#8230;is the kingdom of Enubidia?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400">エーヌビディア</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I take a boat from the port town, I will soon reach the Kingdom of Enubidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as possible, I want to escape to a place where His Majesty&#8217;s power does not extend to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, the members of the 『Stardust Light』are all idiots with one or two quirks. If only he could control them, he would bring back the best results, but unfortunately Julius will not be able to hold the reins of their power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he cannot control them &#8211; there will be horrendous damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to be held responsible for it afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I want to get the hell out of here and escape to the outside world.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I guess I&#8217;ll&#8230;&#8230;enjoy my freedom’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t mind travelling alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m always with someone, so I feel like I&#8217;m spending precious time now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome! We&#8217;ve got the latest in grimoires for sale!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shopkeeper&#8217;s voice can be heard coming from the stall.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, it is time for a new set of magical tools. I already have enough for what I need, but magic tools are delicate items and can get damaged during adventures and other rough activities. It is better to replace them with new ones around here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a comms stone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, of course.It&#8217;s pricey, though&#8230;&#8230;. is 20,000 zeni a piece.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Expensive, but in line with the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then give me six.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Six?&#8230;&#8230; Aaa, well, customer, you&#8217;ve got it all wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shopkeeper chuckled and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One communication stone can hold the contact details of a hundred people.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hundreds?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. So one is more than enough…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then give me eight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The selled widened his eyes in surprise. Ignoring his shock, I paid up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of contacts I want to register is seven hundred and ten. I had thought that six would be enough, since a single communication stone in another country can register one hundred and twenty contacts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,thank you for your continued patronage…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the communication stones I’d have purchased in the pouch around my waist.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving the shopkeeper, who remained surprised, I headed for the port town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next, I&#8217;d better finish the formalities of getting on board the ship.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time is already midday, chances are castle and port towns are close</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I probably won&#8217;t be able to get on the boat today, so I&#8217;ll have to stay overnight. So I decided to hire a carriage, thinking it would be better to get to the port early enough to book accommodation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived in the port town, I immediately headed for the boat station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to board a ship to the Kingdom of Aenebidia, are there any seats still available?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the counter and spoke to the man at reception who was reading the newspaper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, there are seats available, but &#8230;&#8230; we&#8217;re actually having a bit of a problem. There are restrictions on boarding for a while.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Restrictions?”</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s been an outbreak of a large monster called the Kraken in the waters on the way to the Kingdom of Enubidia. Because of it, the only people allowed on board now are adventurers of A-level or above, or those on official missions who have to cross the sea right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kraken are dangerous monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can agree with the restrictions imposed, but&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then no problem. I&#8217;m a grade A adventurer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I take out my adventurer&#8217;s card from my pocket and show it to the man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An adventurer&#8217;s card is a kind of identity card issued by the adventurer&#8217;s guild to which you belong. In addition to the name of the registered person, the card also lists the adventurer&#8217;s grade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh~&#8230;&#8230; you&#8217;re not what you seem, are you?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I get told that a lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although His Majesty made fun of me, being a Class A adventurer is an inherently admirable enough status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is also a privilege of Class A to be able to overcome these restrictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right, I&#8217;ve saved you a seat. The boat will leave in three days&#8217; time, so don&#8217;t be late.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230; ah, wait a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before I turned on my heel, I approached the man again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can I see your charts? I want to know which waters the Kraken will be in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any point in knowing&#8230;.Well, okay. Give me a minute.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short wait, the man unfolds a chart on the counter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think the Kraken has appeared here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man pointed and told me where the Kraken was.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;in these waters, they can just barely reach the sound of the whistle.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m developing a contingency plan for the eventuality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I was able to work out a way to manage even if the Kraken came out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for your help.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I&#8217;m glad it helped.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After I left the window, I decided to look for accommodation to sleep in for the next three days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a port town, there were plenty of places to stay. I decided to stay at an inn that serves delicious seafood dishes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I boarded a ship bound for the Kingdom of Enubidia, as planned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it will take a week until the ship arrives&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I squinted my eyelids in the brilliant sunshine, the sea breeze caressed my cheeks.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stroke my slightly sticky cheeks with my thumbs, thinking of my former companions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the newspaper I bought this morning, the hero party is leaving the Royal Capital today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There seems to be a grand parade celebrating their departure, but the noise and bustle of the parade does not reach the ocean. Not long ago I should have been spending time with them as a member of the 『Stardust Light』, but when I&#8217;m rocking leisurely on the boat, those days seem like someone else&#8217;s business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Julius joined the hero party instead of me, as His Majesty wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I still don&#8217;t think that man can hold the reins of the members, so&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the time I reach the Kingdom of Enubidia, one of our cities will probably have been crushed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Farewell, Julius.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I offer one second of silent prayer for the sacrifice of an old friend.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oops, I guess I should call ahead.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered that I wanted to contact someone before I arrived in the Kingdom of Enubidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately activated the communication stone I had purchased in the castle town and communicated with the person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A female voice can be heard on the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, It’s been a long time isn&#8217;t it? Are you on the clock now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No problem. I&#8217;ll make as much time as I can for you?』</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Loyalty is as high as ever. How that came about is unclear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I&#8217;m on a ship heading for the Kingdom of Enubidia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh, you&#8217;re coming? What do you want?　Since it’s you, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s a natural disaster on the horizon.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more surprising than a natural disaster? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I landed in some trouble and I&#8217;ve decided to leave the country. I&#8217;ll tell you more about it when I see you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『All right. I&#8217;ll show you around the city when I get there.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I don&#8217;t know how many days I&#8217;ll be staying, but &#8230;&#8230; I need some way of earning an income for now. I think I&#8217;ll register with the Adventurers&#8217; Guild when I get there, so maybe you can help me with a few requests.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s no big deal. Do you want to hunt wyverns?”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that’s a good choice. Wyvern tails are as delicious as steaks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was talking about these things, I felt a gaze from somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, there was a young female knight with long blue hair fluttering in the air. She was about seventeen or eighteen years old, about the same as me. The fact that she is wearing armour on a boat trip suggests that she is a serious person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, see you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I disconnect communications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The blue-haired female knight slowly approaches me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, were you on comms?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;m done&#8230;..Do you need anything?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not so much an errand, but I just wanted to say a quick hello.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Greetings?　She corrects her posture in response to me tilting my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am May Ascent. I am a knight of the Kingdom of Enubidia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m Ned Wolkinter. I used to be an adventurer in the Kingdom of Intail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her in the past tense, as I no longer wish to operate as an adventurer in that country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But May did not show any sign of concern and opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re on this ship, that means you&#8217;re an A-level adventurer, right? That&#8217;s a good thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A good thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve heard that there might be a Kraken attact, haven&#8217;t you?　If push comes to shove, we should be comrade-in-arms, to cover each other back. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying hello to you like this.”</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/p033-720x1024.png"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, that&#8217;s an auspicious mindset.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A polite or disciplined person&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is probably a person of good upbringing. Her appearance is very well-defined, and her skin and hair are so beautiful that it is hard to believe that she is a knight who makes her living fighting. It is evidence that she lives in a good environment where she can take care of her appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but please don&#8217;t count me among your forces.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Hmm?　Why is that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My title as an A-level adventurer was forced upon me by the same party of friends who pulled me along. As far as my individual abilities go, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not much different from an E-Level.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; What is that? Isn&#8217;t that a scam?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230;they say that a lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, it is really often said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The faces of His Majesty and Julius passed through my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I heard there was a Class A adventurer on board, so I was expecting to see him, but&#8230;&#8230; he&#8217;s just a fraud.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May informed me with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh well. If it comes to a fight, at best stay out of the way and stay quiet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll let you do that. After all, my motto is &#8216;letting others do the job&#8217;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;A joke. I really despise you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May turned on her heel and went away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was meant to be a joking comment, but apparently it only made the air worse. &#8230;..Well, it wasn&#8217;t really a joke, was it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The best thing would be not to encounter the Kraken. &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to harbour such fleeting hopes, but they were easily dashed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Four days later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We encountered the Kraken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After midday on the fourth day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the surface of the water ahead rolled up vigorously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights of the Kingdom of Enubidia on board the ship were bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seawater that had rolled up turned into a large amount of rain and poured down on the ship. Someone shouted loudly as they were hit by the torrential water and their vision was blurred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Kraken is out!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the signal for battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights who had been waiting in the ship prepared their equipment and rushed to the deck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A giant squid appeared in front of the knights holding up their shields.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the Kraken&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a well-known category of sea-dwelling monsters but I recall that even I have never encountered one yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kraken are extremely dangerous monsters, but they are also cowardly. As soon as they realise that their opponents are superior to them, they quickly retreat. So even if I encounter a Kraken, I can get through it unscathed as long as I take countermeasures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, why are you here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While watching the Kraken on deck, I was approached by May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you to stay out of the way and keep quiet. Now go back inside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll do that, but&#8230;.. can you guys handle it on your own?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft, don&#8217;t worry about it. Don&#8217;t underestimate the knights of the Kingdom of Enubidia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said this, May went to the Kraken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When fighting off a kraken, the important thing is to take initiative first. If we do not look frightened at all and keep showing the will to fight back, the Kraken will eventually leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this reason, the knights should have attacked the Kraken as soon as possible. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;No, &#8230;&#8230;, you&#8217;re undermanned by all accounts.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, the knights are skilled, but with that number of men, they have their hands full just dealing with the Kraken&#8217;s attack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time they seem also having trouble. Their formation is already on the verge of collapse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; It can&#8217;t be helped. I&#8217;ll call them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before heading back inside, I took a shell-shaped whistle from my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle with the Kraken was far fiercer and more intense than expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, a knight of the Kingdom of Enubidia, was knocked down by the violently shaking deck and looked at the Kraken with her hands on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At this rate, we&#8217;ll get hit&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kraken still remains unscatched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has begun to think of those on board this ship as inferior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is this happening?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May asks the knights in the vicinity about the reasons for this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What happened to the other knights! There must have been more knights waiting on deck!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of the ten who were waiting, four were dropped into the sea by the Kraken&#8217;s surprise attack. Two barely survived, but are currently undergoing treatment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And the other four?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..are down with seasickness.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My foot almost slipped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what a useless bunch&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand on my forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is an abomination that I do not want to think of as the same knight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remembered that a few days ago I had called an adventurer from the Kingdom of Intail a [fraud].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I owe him an apology. My colleagues are much more cowardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll take the lead, you guys follow!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa-wait, May-sama!　You, the Knight of the Kingsguard, if you’re hurt, the Princess&#8230;Rushia-sama will be  sad!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be stupid!　It&#8217;s a knight&#8217;s duty to fight physically at times like this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if I can&#8217;t fight off the Kraken at this point, it will be more than just me getting hurt. Along with the ship will be reduced to rubbish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May approached the Kraken with determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kraken swung its thick tentacle down. May blocked it, using her sword as a shield.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ggh, ah&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, knights with large shields would have gathered to defend against this blow. May&#8217;s skill in single-handedly defending against it was assured, but the burden was too much. Her arms and legs were numb and motionless, and the sword fell from her palms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──It&#8217;s bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is completely unprotected. If the Kraken continues its attack, it cannot be prevented.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If any more people leave the front line, the line of defeat will finally become thicker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May gritted her teeth and tried to move, ignoring the numbness in his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately afterwards &#8211; suddenly, a high-pitched whistle sounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was that sound &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that some kind of signal?　However, there was no sign of anyone rushing on deck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As May wondered &#8211; suddenly the Kraken screamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kraken&#8217;s condition suddenly changes, and the knights on deck are also puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The paralysed May, now able to move, closes in on the Kraken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before he can draw his sword, May stops moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the Kraken&#8217;s feet, a shadow of something is seen on the surface of the water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that a&#8230;..mermaid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s upper half of the body is human but the lower part is half fish. This is the characteristic of the mermaid race.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mermaids that are living at the bottom of the sea swam freely in the water and poked the kraken incessantly with spearheads in their hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are the mermaids joining us in attacking the kraken,&#8230;&#8230;?&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A scene unfolded before their eyes that could only be perceived as such.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it is a sight that is not supposed to be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s ridiculous&#8230;..Mermaids hate humans. What&#8230;&#8230; is this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kraken screams once more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, the Kraken moved away from the ship and was dragged to the seabed by the&#8230;.. Mermaids.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the Kraken left the ship, I put the whistle away in my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, the surface of the water in front of me bubbled and soon countless mermaids appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Land Dwellers!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『O people of the land dwellers!!　We have defeated the Kraken!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Give us, our reward!　People of the land dwellers!!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mermaids gathered in the straw and demanded their rewards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With splashes of water flying everywhere, I take out what I have prepared from my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes. Apples, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh &#8230;&#8230;! This is the very essence of life!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It is no exaggeration to say that the people of the land exist to produce this!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s an exaggeration.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To say it is an exaggeration for humans to produce apples is a bit too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;.I&#8217;m glad I bought apples in the port town for this kind of situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mermaids like several things, and apples are one of them. I&#8217;ll buy as many as I can if it puts them in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to call you on such short notice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Don’t it mind!　Ned has made a covenant with us!　That&#8217;s why she gave you the whistle!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A male mermaid said loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Generally, the mermaids who come out to fight are men. His upper body was wrapped in strong muscular armour and he held a very heavy spear, using the buoyancy of the water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『By the way, Ned!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The Queen wants to see Ned!　Come to the Ryugu Palace!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Roger. Tell her I&#8217;ll come when things settle down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don&#8217;t come soon, she will create a huge tsunami and sink this ship!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not good. I&#8217;ll give you another apple, try to appease her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes, sir!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said this, the mermaid dove back into the water.</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/p043-720x1024.png"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Kraken is defeated and the ship is sunk, it&#8217;s the end of the world. Perhaps I&#8217;ve just eliminated the second crisis that was looming over the ship&#8230;&#8230;?　Well, as for the second crisis, it looks like it came about because of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the mermaids are completely out of sight, I hear footsteps nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, y-you &#8230;&#8230;, that was &#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a wide-eyed and astonished May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I was communicating, you stood somewhere near me and this time, is &#8230;&#8230;does May has a peeping-tom hobby?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah?! N-no, no!　It just happened, I’m standing here at the wrong time!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May denied it with a red face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More importantly, what did you do? That was a mermaid, wasn&#8217;t it?　Mermaids hate humans. They&#8217;re the kind of people you&#8217;d normally have to fight with just to see each other, let alone have a conversation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally that might be true, but &#8230;&#8230; well, I&#8217;m kind of a friend”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Friends&#8230;.? A mermaid and a human&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be precise, I’m friends with the Ryugu tribe who live in the western waters. In exchange, I have a bit of a disagreement with the Lorei tribe, who live in the eastern waters. But I know someone who has an alliance with Lorei, so I think I can negotiate peacefully with mermaids from almost any ocean.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“??????”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May looked confused at the information I gave her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may have even given out a bit of unnecessary information but I don&#8217;t have a problem with that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s hard to believe, but in short, you can negotiate with mermaids&#8230;..So, in the battle with the Kraken earlier, you were the one who called the mermaids?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. I told you,  my motto is &#8216;letting others do the job.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the help of others, no one can beat me. I even take such pride in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I jokingly said this in a boastful manner, May’s lips tightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s complicated, but &#8230;&#8230;whatever it is, it does look like you&#8217;re our saviour…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little surprised. I thought I was going to be mocked again, but it seems that May is more tolerant of other people&#8217;s values than I thought. I hope His Majesty the King of the Kingdom of Intail will learn something from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you make some time after we arrive in the country?　I want to thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, for whom networking is the only weapon in my arsenal, there is no reason to refuse the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I welcome meeting and interacting with new people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be my pleasure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days had passed since the defeat of the Kraken.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seven-day boat trip came to an end and the land of the Kingdom of Enubidia was in sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the ship approaches the harbour, May calls out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As promised, let me thank you. Are you sure you&#8217;re free for today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I&#8217;m free all day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good. Then I have some places I&#8217;d like to show you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My schedule is free, or rather, I left it open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I actually had someone I was meeting up with, but after consulting with her, I changed my meeting with her to tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, um, May-sama. Are you sure?　Inviting adventurers from other countries into your castle. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He&#8217;s our benefactor, it won&#8217;t be a problem. Besides, Rushia-sama likes adventurers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights are having some kind of conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled when I heard the words knights and castle. Apparently, I&#8217;ve been associated with those things of late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you end up in the Kingdom of Intail?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ I was escorting a nobleman from our country who was staying over there for a few days or so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the nobility of the Kingdom of Enuvidia was visiting the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did not know that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve arrived safely”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ship arrived at the port and stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome. To the country that has made a pact with a dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Kingdom of Enuvidia, a country which made a pact with a dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The country is said to have borrowed power from a great dragon when it was founded. Before, the land in this area was said to have dried up. As a result, crops did not grow, but with the dragon&#8217;s blessing, the land was enriched and blessed with resources.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some monsters are intelligent and can interact with people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragons are a prime example of such monsters and are extremely powerful. History shows that humans and dragons sometimes fought and sometimes cooperated </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">with each other, but the only example of a dragon supporting the founding of a country is the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Spectacular.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu, &#8230;..that’s right! This is a good country!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May smiled happily, she was happy that I praised her kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The buildings in the Kingdom of Enuvidia are larger in scale than those in the Kingdom of Intail. Such is the culture that has taken root. Dragon ornaments and figurines can be seen here and there, perhaps to entertain the tourists. The scenery is gorgeous for a port town.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Incidentally, that legendary adventurer party, the 『The Seven Meteors』, once stopped by this town.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeee?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but voice my doubts at May’s statement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, what&#8217;s with that reaction? Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;ve never heard of 『The Seven Meteors』?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Uh, yeah. I know that much about tthem, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no way I don&#8217;t know them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The adventurer party 『The Seven Meteors』- is the most famous adventurers in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feats accomplished by that adventuring party are too numerous to mention: they have conquered impregnable dungeons, defeated large monsters that were threatening the world, and pioneered the development of lands that had never been explored before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strongest adventuring party, both in name and in reality, is the 『The Seven Meteors』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a common knowledge in this world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Likewise, the fact that the&#8230;.『The Seven Meteors』 was disbanded a year ago is also common knowledge known by people all over the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did the 『The Seven Meteors』 stop by this town?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!　I&#8217;d like to be able to say with pride&#8230;.but strictly speaking, they were just passing nearby. But when you&#8217;re dealing with the 『The Seven Meteors』, that alone makes me feel proud.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ooh &#8230;. I see. So that&#8217;s what this is about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a slight discrepancy in information, which was puzzling but satisfactory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fame of the adventurer party 『The Seven Meteors』 is tremendous. A town can become a tourist attraction simply because a party has stayed. This port town must have been aiming for such an economic effect and spreading the same sales pitch to its people as May had mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There were a few well-known adventurer parties in the Kingdom of Aenebidia, weren&#8217;t there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, The most famous is probably the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』. Ned knows about that party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adventurer party 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The party, who hail from the Kingdom of Enuvidia, are all clad in knight&#8217;s armour, which is unusual for adventurers. The party has made a name for itself mainly by conquering dungeons and defeating monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 are a party of adventurers, but they are the object of admiration for the country&#8217;s knights. In particular, the leader of the Order, Lady Riese Von Aldiana, is an S-class adventurer and a former aristocrat, and has a reputation for being noble and beauty&#8230;&#8230;. I, for one, am fascinated by her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does May perhaps admire this person?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah!　Along with the 『The Seven Meteors』, she is one of the most respected people in the world!　I hope to be a knight like that one day!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May said excitedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren&#8217;t there several well-known adventurer parties in the kingdom of Intail, where Ned is from?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah. But when it comes to the latest buzz, I think it&#8217;s the Hero Party.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“TheHero Party. &#8230;&#8230; I see that Hero Party also started their journey just as we were leaving the Kingdom of Intail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May also seems to know a little about the hero party of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Although countries around the world now dispatch their hero parties, I had thought that the 『The Seven Meteors』 would go on to defeat the Demon King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May mutters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am sure many of us thought so. That&#8217;s how strong the 『The Seven Meteors』 was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since its break-up a year ago, 『The Seven Meteors』 has not shown its face to the public. What are they doing now&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder&#8230;&#8230;probably, living their lives as they like?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">!No!　They must be holding important positions in the country, or carrying out top-secret missions &#8230;..doing things we can&#8217;t imagine!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is a bit of a dreamer, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the heroic party like in the Kingdom of Intail? After all, they were selected directly by the kingdom, they must be very strong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder&#8230;&#8230;if it&#8217;s by strength alone, I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re probably better than any country&#8217;s heroic parties. &#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say in a small voice and May looks at me strangely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Extra issue! Breaking News!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, a newspaper vendor passed in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take a coin from my pouch and approach the newsagent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me one stack.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I read the newspaper as soon as I receive it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, moved her face closer to the newspaper as if peering into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this, &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is surprised to see the biggest headline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-aa, I told you it was &#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On it, in large, bold letters, were the words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Hero Party from the Kingdom of Intail destroys the city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five days after the hero party began their journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The prime minister rushed into the king&#8217;s room in a great hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty! There’s bad news!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A brave party has destroyed the city!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king stiffened with his mouth open in a pout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister was sweating all over, probably because he had come in such a hurry. When the Prime Minister, who had been breathing hard, began to calm down, the King&#8217;s halted thoughts moved again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?　Explain!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, &#8230;&#8230;Julius reported that during their travels, they encountered a monster that appeared to be under the command of the Demon King and they got into a fight. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister continues with an awkward look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the aftermath of the&#8230;.battle, the city was destroyed. The lake, which had been a tourist attraction, disappeared and the nearby forests were burnt to the ground. Fortunately, the inhabitants have already been evacuated, but&#8230;..they are demanding large amounts of compensation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King&#8217;s face paled into a blue pallor at the report, which was far beyond anything he could have imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W—wha-what,ho-w did this happen&#8230;&#8230;?!&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king had ordered his prime minister to report to him whenever the heroes&#8217; party was active. However, he had no idea that the memorable first report was not about achievements, but about damage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You made sure Julius had a communication stone, didn&#8217;t you?　Connect to comms immediately!　I&#8217;m going to talk to him directly!”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s the thing, the city&#8217;s inhabitants responded to the comms link&#8230;..and apparently Julius has overworked.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!? They’ve only been on the road for five days!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of schedule was made that Julius can be overworked in five days?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King can&#8217;t imagine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Incidentally, according to Julius&#8217; last report, &#8230;&#8230; the hero said, 『There&#8217;s a call for help over there!』 After that, he disappeared. The warrior is so immersed in monster hunting that having a conversation is impossible. The wizard stubbornly refuses to move until he has read all the books in the city&#8217;s library, and the monk seems to be unnecessarily raising the dead to create further chaos”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,oo,oooo&#8230;&#8230; what is this happeing&#8230;&#8230; my head can&#8217;t keep up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The elegance is not suited to the hero party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The size of the problem is out of the norm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-why? How did this happen?　What was Julius doing!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apparently, no matter what Julius said, the members responded that 『Ned wouldn&#8217;t say that』 or 『I only want to listen to what Ned says』 and refuse to follow instructions.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gunnu&#8230;&#8230; that man, did he brainwash them&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It reminded the king of a man called Ned, whom he kicked out of the party a few days ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could this happen because of that man?　Come to think of it, that man said, 『That party is all the members I have gathered on the assumption that I will control them』. After all, can a brave party only be controlled by Ned? ─ ─ No.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ned is a person with no redeeming qualities. In fact, he has left behind no notable achievements in the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If even a man like him could control the members of the party.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no reason why Julius should not be able to do the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; give these instructions once Julius has recovered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King, who has regained his composure, tells the prime minister calmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The hero party may be an S-class adventurer, but they are still human beings. If they violate orders too much, punish them severely&#8230;&#8230;. If the situation calls for it, you can even use my authority on them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister nods his head at the King&#8217;s order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reports reached the King&#8217;s ears that Julius had been seriously wounded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tl Note:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(So Rushia use 妾 Mekake, Mistress/Concubine to refer herself. But I’ll just I,me,my, because it’s easier )  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From here we&#8217;ll take a carriage ride.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a reasonable walk through the port town, May led me to a carriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prompted to get in first, I climbed into the carriage carefully. Then May got in too, and the door was closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where are we going?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Royal Capital. I would like you to meet my employer there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is a knight. Her employer would be, at the very least, an aristocrat&#8230;..or a politician. She seems to be quite grateful to me for fighting off the Kraken, but all I did was call the mermaid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage began to move slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the regular sound of the horse begins to be heard, May opens her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; a pity. I didn&#8217;t expect the hero party from the Kingdom of Intail to end up like this so early on. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, well, it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;expected, and I&#8217;m not that surprised&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It really was as expected but I&#8217;m a little concerned about what Her Majesty looks like now. Should I secretly contact the Princess and ask her how she&#8217;s doing? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterwards, May and I talked a lot about each other&#8217;s countries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I am more focused on different countries, so I&#8217;m not actually particularly knowledgeable about the Kingdom of Intail. Even when I was a student, I skipped classes and went on an adventure in other countries, so I probably have less knowledge of the country than the average citizen of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have arrived.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After an hour or so, the carriage pulls up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The carriage had entered the royal capital a few minutes earlier. And now, in front of us &#8211; the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this&#8230;&#8230;the royal castle of the Kingdom of Enuvidia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. I would now like Ned to meet my employer, Her Royal Highness Princess Rushia&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve always had a thing for princesses, castles and knights, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when May&#8217;s employer is a princess, one fact is revealed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought May is just a knight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa. I serve as a knight of the Kingsguard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is apparently a knight guarding the royalty. That&#8217;s a reasonably high status.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need to be nervous. She may be a princess, but she&#8217;s a friendly person. I have to behave in a formal manner because of my status, but perhaps Ned will allow me to be easy-going&#8230;..Of course, we don&#8217;t have to meet her if you don&#8217;t want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; No, by all means let us meet. I have a principle that if I haven&#8217;t met someone before, I&#8217;ll meet them anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a good principle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After all, you might be able to help me in a pinch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I’d withdraw my previous statement. It&#8217;s a calculating principle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think any principle that isn&#8217;t backed by calculation is just delusional.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed May&#8217;s lead into the castle and reached the end of the corridor, and there is a door in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have already reported about you to Rushia -sama. Let&#8217;s go in, shall we?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Checking my appearance, I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May opens the door. Beyond it was a luxurious room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A red carpet with exquisite patterns engraved on it, and many ornaments that I could tell were expensive just by looking at them. On top of that, the room was well furnished with a set of practical furniture. In the Kingdom of Intail, I entered the audience chamber to meet the king, but this time I was to meet Her Royal Highness the Princess. From the scale of the door, this is probably one of the princess&#8217;s private chambers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl sitting in the centre of the room looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Rushia Enuvidia. I am the princess of this country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl who appeared to be in her mid-teens sat on the throne.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a beautiful girl. Her skin is as white as the first snow and her hair is long and clear silver. She has a slender body that could be broken just by touching it, but her crimson twin eyes are like jewels set into a pedestal, exuding a strength that will never waver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel the noble atmosphere around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was convinced just by taking one look at her that I had met the right person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My years of experience tell me this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This will surely be a good meet up for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is an honour to meet you. I am…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, good, good. May owe you a favour, right?　Then you are as good a friend as any-ja.. You can be a little more open.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; if that&#8217;s what you wish.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lift my deeply bowed head and relax my shoulders just a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what I&#8217;ve heard from the upper class people I&#8217;ve met so far. Aristocrats and royalty are often fed up with a stuffy environment. So many of them want to at least talk casually with outsiders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it would be better to at least use honorifics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if Lady Rushia says there is no problem, it does not necessarily mean that others who adore her will feel the same way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My name is Ned Wolkinter. I was an adventurer in the Kingdom of Intail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, an adventurer. I like adventurers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia  smiles and says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, let me first thank you. Thank you for helping &#8230;&#8230; May. For me, May is one of the few friends I can trust. If you hadn&#8217;t repelled the Kraken, I would be in a state of grief right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone was a little peculiar, but she was polite even to me, a commoner, and her behaviour showed her good nature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s nice of you to thank me, but I haven&#8217;t done much. The one who defeated the Kraken is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“- mermaids, I hear?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says with a grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you decided where you&#8217;re going to sleep today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I haven&#8217;t decided. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then you can stay here in the castle today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I am surprised at the sudden suggestion, Rushia -sama continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Instead, tell me about the adventures you&#8217;ve had so far. I love adventure tales!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, that makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, this was the real reason for calling me here. I glanced at May and was met with a soft smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. If it&#8217;s okay with me, I&#8217;ll talk about it as much as you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that evening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had dinner with Princess Rushia  and I talked about my adventures up to this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course &#8211; I hid somepart to ensure secrecy .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conversations with Princess Rushia continued late into the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho! So what happened to that aerial temple?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;I had an acquaintance snipe the core of the temple and destroyed it. Now pieces of the collapsed temple are being sold as a local speciality.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa-ha-ha!　The land of legends is now an easy souvenir!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her the story of my adventures in the aerial temple known as the Land of Legends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia really seemed to like hearing adventure stories. Although she is supposed to be of noble status, listening to me, Princess Rushia&#8217;s eyes light up like a child enjoying the reading of a storybook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I told her a story about climbing a volcano to defeat a monster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho, ho&#8230;&#8230; monsters in the crater of a volcano? Surely that&#8217;s a difficult monster. So how did you defeat it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had a wizard friend of mine freeze the whole volcano, and while he was doing that, I quickly killed it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Freeze the volcano&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; eh? Is that even possible?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it seems that those who can, can.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laugh and say to the confused Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised when I saw it too. [I&#8217;ve got a new technique to show Ned~!] I remember being told that and almost frozen by it. I do wonder if that wizard is going to ice me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now&#8230;..What else shall I talk about?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was sorting out the repertoire of stories in my head, there was a knock at the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia, it&#8217;s time to go to bed, or you&#8217;ll be in trouble tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, is it that late already? It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve lost track of &#8230;&#8230; time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad she was satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the pleasant banter is about to end. I picked up a cup from the table and quenched my thirst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia -sama stares at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you &#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t seem too nervous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nervous?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I tilt my head, Princess Rushia tells me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, no. If I may say so myself, I’m&#8230;&#8230;beautiful, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beautiful, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Haa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beauty──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu, after all, &#8230;&#8230;I am beautiful.”</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/p063-720x1024.png"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she nodded her head, Princess Rushia smiled with satisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the conversation moved on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why most boys who meet me for the first time are usually too nervous to speak well,&#8230;&#8230; but you, you seem to be, how should I say, used to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well,&#8230;..maybe I&#8217;m actually used to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia is still very young and her body is hardly uneven, but she has a face that will no doubt make her a beauty in the future. But I knew several of the opposite sex who were equally good-looking. The princess of the Kingdom of Intail is one of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, is there a woman in the world as beautiful as a me?&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They rarely exist, but they&#8217;re there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a conversation, and I had my doubts too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia, you seem to be quite fond of adventure stories, have you ever thought of adventuring yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm, that&#8217;s because that &#8230;..I’m the princess of this country&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, as a princess, she can&#8217;t sing or celebrate her freedom compared to us commoners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I sympathised with her in my heart, Princess Rushia continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;ight, I&#8217;m afraid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Afraid of fighting?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you encounter a monster, you have to fight, don&#8217;t you?&#8230;&#8230; I am afraid of fighting and conflict&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These words were unimaginable from the previously sprightly Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slightly surprised, I express my honest impression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.You also have a surprisingly timid side, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah! W-w-what cowardice!　Even I, the princess, can be afraid!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s face turned red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with being afraid of fighting, but from the way she had been talking, I had thought she was more feisty and daring. This is a little surprising.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beside me, who was surprised in this way, May smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia-sama can&#8217;t even hold a weapon, you know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-oii! May! Don&#8217;t say unnecessary things!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pardon me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an not guilty look on her face, May straightened her posture again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a knight of the Kingsguard, May seems to be able to talk casually with Princess Rushia. Even so, because of her different position from me, the guest, May never sat down in front of her lord, Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s fine, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say to Princess Rushia, who is puffing her cheeks out in dissatisfaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s unusual for royalty to engage in physical combat, and&#8230;..not having the strength to fight doesn&#8217;t diminish Princess Rushia&#8217;s value.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that as encouragement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when Princess Rushia heard those words, she instantly turned mysterious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have the strength to fight…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t miss her little murmur.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, my mistake. Is Princess Rushia willing to overcome her weaknesses, and inwardly seeking the strength to fight?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. I misspoke. After all, as royalty, you should have power…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.,no..You are not wrong!　Ned is right, I don&#8217;t have the strength to fight! I’m weak!　So it&#8217;s no surprise that &#8230;..I’m a coward!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says somewhat excitedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tone sounded a little exaggerated, and I felt a tugging sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if she was saying to herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia, it&#8217;s time to go&#8230;&#8230;&#8217;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oops, right”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Meir&#8217;s words, Princess Rushia looks at me with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, I had a good time today!　Now that I’m satisfied, you too can get some rest!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I shall do so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This will Ned-sama room”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room to which I was shown by the castle maid was truly opulently decorated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was spacious, the windows were large, the furnishings were all delicately patterned and there was a fine red carpet underfoot. It is a good thing that I left the kingdom of Intail and was able to enjoy such an environment so soon, but now that I have come this far, I am worried about my future life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is a large bathroom for guests in the castle, if you wish to use it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, thanks for showing me around.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid bowed solemnly and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the door quietly closed, I exhaled a &#8216;huff&#8217; and placed my waist pouch on the table.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m still wide awake&#8230;..should I register my contact details on my comms stone while I&#8217;m at it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a communication stone from my pouch and stroked the circular frame in a clockwise direction, and letters appeared on the surface of the stone. One by one, the contacts, which had been jotted down on paper, were registered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a steady and tedious process. I have registered the contact details of 500 people, but there are still 200 more to go. If possible, I want to finish this today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Occasionally, he continued working, looking out of the window at the quiet cityscape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Ah &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; finally, I&#8217;m done.&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I had registered everyone&#8217;s contact details, I straightened my back lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was concentrating so hard I didn&#8217;t realise it, but it was a little chilly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s time to take a bath and go to bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; hmm?　Speaking of which, where are the big bathrooms?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems there are bathrooms in the rooms, but since I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;d like to use the castle&#8217;s main bathrooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I forgot to ask and I couldn&#8217;t find it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I step out of the room, I spot a maid walking down the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a different person from the maid who showed me to my room, but it would not be a problem if I called out to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you help me?　I need to go to the main bathrooms&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want the main baths, go straight down this hall and turn left at the end of the hall.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thank the maid for her guidance and follow the path as told.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I undressed in the changing room and stepped into the large bath, white steam blocked my view.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh,&#8230;&#8230; this is quite something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The large bathrooms make lavish use of the spacious area. The ceiling is high and open, and the tiles underfoot are smooth and easy to step on. The gold and silver decorations created an elegant atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Amazing&#8230;..Is this really for guests of honour?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve travelled all over the world and have been in some of the most luxurious baths there are, but this is an order of magnitude different. I will go to bed tonight feeling fabulous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wash myself lightly and then immerse myself in the bathtub.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;hira-sama &#8230;&#8230; hot water level is&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm&#8230;&#8230;iru also&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the rising white steam, I could hear someone talking.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Was there someone ahead of me? &#8230;&#8230; If you&#8217;re invited to the castle, you might be a nobleman.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would normally be irregular for a mere commoner like me to be invited to a castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might be better to greet them lightly if our faces meet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I think about this, the steam gradually clears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of my eyes, &#8230;..Rushia  and May were soaking in the bathtub in a state of undress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..Mm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each one of us becomes flabbergasted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After ten seconds of silence, </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oouuu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screams that rip through the silk are overwhelming and half-heartedly startling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, ned! You!!! How did you get here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that&#8217;s my line&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I answer May’s teary-eyed, shouting question, I think about why this is happening.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230; I thought I was asking where the large bathrooms for guests were, but was I directed to the bathrooms used by Rushia and May?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I guessed how I’d enter this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of my eyes, the two girls reveal their alertness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mah, May!　What are you going to do?　What am I supposed to do in a situation like this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know! And, for now, it&#8217;s better to hide our body &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were completely confused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s face still has a faintly innocent look, but her body is feminine, with clearly visible bumps. She has no lean flesh, probably due to her training as a knight. Her fresh, water-repellent skin has a sex appeal that is hard to imagine from her usual appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Rushia&#8217;s figure is slender and almost as uneven as her body, but her porcelain-clear skin and silver hair, which looks even more lustrous when wet with water, give her a mysterious beauty. Her cheeks, which are tinted red with a hint of moisture, and her embarrassed expression give her a sex appeal different from that of May. It was as if I was looking at a delicate work of art. There was a noble figure there that should never be&#8230;&#8230;defiled, which is essentially unattainable for the mundane person to see or touch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ta, towel!　May!　Bring me a towel!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye-yes I understand!　I&#8217;ll bring it to you right away!Aa—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who got up from the bathtub and headed out at a fast pace, falls down when she crosses my side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuhh&#8230;.., my foot, I slipped &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May let out a groan and tried to stand up, putting both knees on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, if she gets up in front of me, I&#8217;m going to &#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re in full view of &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia blurts out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When May got up, she was red up to her ears and her whole body was shaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t do it anymore&#8230;.kill this man and I&#8217;ll die,&#8230;&#8230; too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, no, no, no&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand to my forehead as May glares at me with tears in the corners of his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll leave normally, you two just wait in the bathtub.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told them as calmly as possible to calm their confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn my back and then stand up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I intended to leave the bathroom, but I turned around to ask a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, where are the big baths for guests?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yo-you! Why are you being so, so calm!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no point in making a fuss now, is there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tells her in a calm manner, May&#8217;s face turns red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“One floor down! Go quickly!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly headed to the changing room to get dressed and went out into the corridor with my hair barely dry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if I&#8217;m accused of disrespect? &#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ll make a quick getaway then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But &#8230;&#8230; How much more unwary can they be?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I, for example, had plotted to assassinate Princess Rushia , it would be a disaster by now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance and surroundings of the castle were well guarded, but inside there were many blind spots.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is there a reason for this?&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, I headed for the large bathroom for guests of honour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning. I woke up in the guest room in the royal castle in the kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning already…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at the morning sun shining through the gap in the curtains and let out a sore yawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room was cosy and comfortable. The bed was soft and fluffy, I slept well, and I feel like I&#8217;m going to have a good time today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They said I could do whatever I wanted as long as I didn&#8217;t go upstairs&#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;ll go for a light walk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After washing my face and getting dressed, I headed for the gardens outside the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning mist is thick. Did it rain last night while I slept?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked along the damp cobblestones, and before I knew it, everything was enveloped in mist in all directions. I thought I had come to see the beautiful scenery of the gardens, but perhaps I came at the wrong time of day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was about to return to the castle, I suddenly noticed a strange reflection in the haze in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ A huge shadow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shadow so tall that it seemed to reach the second&#8230;. or even the third floor of the castle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what it is &#8211; but as long as it is moving, it must be a creature.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Don’t tell me it’s a monster?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly alert, I mobilise all the knowledge in my head to try to understand the phenomenon in front of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had no idea what it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Who are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl&#8217;s voice is heard from the front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I maintained my vigilance and waited in silence, Princess Rushia appeared from the haze in which the &#8230;&#8230; shadow was reflected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, it&#8217;s you, Ned?”&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uumu. Good morning, it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s words trailed off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Nothi-nothing&#8230;&#8230;!　I mean, after what happened last night!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia blushes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ I haven&#8217;t even shown it to my father since I was over three years old. &#8230;.! And yet you&#8230;..stare at me so clearly for such a long time. &#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It wasn&#8217;t so much that I was staring&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I can&#8217;t deny that I saw it, because it&#8217;s true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I have heard about the situation from the maid. You are not responsible for this matter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to mean that there is no one to blame. Powerful people are often extremely violent once they lose control of themselves, but I am glad that Rushia seems to be a person of character.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Princess Rushia. Did you see something here just now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm?　I thought I was the only one here&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia tilts her head curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What, then, was the shadow just now?&#8230;&#8230;Was I imagining something?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. What are you going to do in this country?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia asks me about my future plans.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For now, let&#8217;s just say that the shadow I just saw was my imagination &#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, I think I&#8217;ll register with the Adventurers Guild to secure a source of income.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, you were an adventurer in the Kingdom of Intail, so that would be good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia nodded. In this day and age, there is usually an adventurers&#8217; guild in every country, but unfortunately they do not work together perfectly. If I wanted to work as an adventurer in the Kingdom of Aenebidia, I had to re-register. I had to start over from the lowest grade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I shall send May as your guide.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure about &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really enjoyed the tales of adventure you told me last night! And for that, I want to thank you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your Highness is a generous princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am still not yet familiar with the streets of this city, as I came by carriage from the port town to the castle. I&#8217;ll have to take advantage of Princess Rushia&#8217;s goodwill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I will now show you around the city. You wanted to go to the Adventurers&#8217; Guild, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, lead the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a quick breakfast at the castle, I walked through the city with May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The royal city of Enuvidia was pleasant. It was safe and lively. Children running around and old couples strolling are the very symbol of peace.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Does she not care what happened last night&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Princess Rushia, there was no change in May&#8217;s condition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last night, if anything, I&#8217;m sure May was in a worse position than Princess Rushia&#8230;.. Maybe I should be the one to apologise here, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May. About what happened last night&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last night?　Oh, you mean the adventurous tales you told Princess Rushia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t expect that direction, so I was a little slow to react.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s about what happened at the baths&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bath?　I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. You and I parted ways in Princess Rushia&#8217;s room and that was the last time I saw you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard those words, It was clear to me that May wants to pretend that the incident at the bath never happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no need to provoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must have hurt her a lot&#8230;..prickles and guilt eat away at her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. That adventure story you told Princess Rushia yesterday, how true was that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head, unsure of the meaning of the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean by that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t be telling the truth about going to an aerial temple or freezing an entire volcano,　I&#8217;m not too impressed with you overstating your achievements, even if it&#8217;s just to amuse Princess Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, May is in disbelief about what I said last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn&#8217;t exaggerate at all. It all really happened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. No, no, that&#8217;s ridiculous. If that was all true, you&#8217;re not just an A-level adventurer, you&#8217;re an S-level adventurer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m a grade A, but everyone around me is a grade S.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her that&#8217;s why I was able to make it happen, May looked downcast with a serious expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. No, no, no. You’re not fooling me. Because if the story is true,&#8230;&#8230; there are only three parties that made it to the Aerial Temple,&#8230;&#8230; and two of them can&#8217;t be in this country. But if it&#8217;s the other one, then Ned&#8230;&#8230; impossible, impossible, it can&#8217;t be &#8230;&#8230; possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May mumbled something out. I may have said too much that confused her a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does she know more about the adventurers&#8217; situation? I recall that yesterday she said she was fascinated by the leader of the adventurers&#8217; party 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this the right road?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh,Aaa. You&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s just around this corner to the right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May comes to her senses and resumes guiding me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, what do you do after you register with the guild? Are you going to take the job straight away?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I intend to. Princess Rushia said I could stay at the castle today, but&#8230;.that would be bothersome, and I&#8217;d like to earn enough money to pay for today&#8217;s accommodation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ok. Then I&#8217;ll help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words were unexpected and I accidentally stared at May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia has asked me to keep you company for the rest of the day. I&#8217;m registered with the guild as a Class B adventurer, in case you&#8217;re interested, so I can take requests. If&#8230;&#8230;you don&#8217;t need me, I&#8217;ll leave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please stay, I&#8217;ve already prepared a collaborator. Can we have a quick meeting first?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. &#8230;&#8230; But you already have a collaborator in place, so it&#8217;s not as if your motto is helping others.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the only thing I&#8217;ve got going for me”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If May is willing to help, it will be easier to make more money than planned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Adventurers&#8217; Guild is responsible for mediating requests from towns and countries. Some of these requests require a minimum number of people, so if there are three of us, we can take on larger requests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the Adventurers Guild. Let&#8217;s go inside.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May opened the door and I followed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere of the guilds seems to be the same everywhere. In the old-fashioned but somehow atmospheric wooden buildings, men and women with weapons and armour are everywhere talking to each other. There was a tavern right next door, and even though it was only mid-morning, I could hear the lively voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m meeting the first collaborator here&#8230;&#8230;but she hasn&#8217;t arrived yet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let&#8217;s wait at that table over there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I follow May’s directions and take a seat at the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, who is the collaborator?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to explain, but after thinking for a moment, I retracted the words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. since we&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s keep it to ourselves.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm, what&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you&#8217;ll find out soon enough. Maybe May will be surprise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About five minutes later, the guild door opened.</span></p>

<p>"Oh, here she comes.”</span></p>

<p>I look blankly at the door and realise that the person I&#8217;m looking for has arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the sound of my voice, May also turns around&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha────────?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When May saw the person who appeared, she stiffened with her mouth open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guild was abuzz at her appearance, clad in pure white armour. [Hey, that one], [Why are you here], [I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s her], [She&#8217;s beautiful] &#8230;.. such voices could be heard from everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There you are, Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo, long time no see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel nostalgic and reassured by the face I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa,aaa,Aaaa&#8230;..N-no-no, no way, no way, no way&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the woman approaching, May&#8217;s confusion became even more intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, who is she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is my second collaborator.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, then I should introduce myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think May already knows her&#8230;well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m Riese Von Aldiana, Leader of the White Dragon Chivalric Order. Pleasure to meet you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An adventurer who is admired by the knights, and whom May fascinated by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who is also one of my friends, smiles quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a beautiful woman in pure white armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her tall stature and well-defined eyes attracted the gaze of even her own gender. Her beautiful golden hair was wavy and so glamorous that it was hard to believe that she belonged to an adventurer who made her living fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese Von Aldiana.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is surely no one in the Kingdom of Enuvidia who does not know her name. She is the leader of the White Dragon Chivalric Order, an outstanding party of adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, so you are a knight of the Princess&#8217;s Kingsguard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha! Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, seated at the table, was quick to get to know May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We&#8217;re going to be commissioned by the Adventurers Guild to take down monsters. Danger is inherent in fighting monsters. That&#8217;s why it pays to know the people you&#8217;re entrusting your backs to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two people who are meeting for the first time here are Riese and May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So the two were now trying to build a relationship of trust through casual chit-chat, but it seems that May was nervous because she had just met Riese, the woman of her dreams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see you and Net met on the boat. This is something of a coincidence, so I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard that the Kingsguard knights&#8217; swordsmanship is first-rate. I have high hopes for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there anything else you would like to ask me,May?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Ah!!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the part where she shouldn&#8217;t answer immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May also seemed to realise immediately, and the blood quickly drained from her face. She then looked as if she was about to cry. It was probably a mistake to bring her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m going to register with the guild for now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, the tension in May is not going to be released anytime soon, so I should start acting on the request as soon as possible. To do that I have to register with the guild first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. I know it&#8217;s a bit late for this, but if an adventurer has just registered, he&#8217;s an E-level, right?　You can&#8217;t take on big requests in that state, can you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese looks at me as I get up from my chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. So for now, I&#8217;m going to do my usual routine and get promoted to grade D straight away.”</span></p>
<p>Having said this, I headed for the counter where the receptionist stood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome. How may I help you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to register as an adventurer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. Please fill in this form first. Do you need anything else?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist gives me a registration form and I fill it in with a quill pen on the counter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After filling in my name, age and gender, the form contained the following sections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Existence Power Level】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Blessings】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Special Armament】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Other】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a registered member of several national adventurers&#8217; guilds, I was familiar with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Basically, these four items are indicators of an adventurer&#8217;s ability.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Existence Power&#8230;&#8230; is a numerical value that represents overall strength, which is raised by defeating monsters. The higher this value, the stronger the person is physically and mentally. However, the ease with which existence power can be raised varies greatly from person to person. The average value for ordinary people is 1, while the average for those who are called heroes is roughly 6. 7 is a legend, and there are no more than ten of them in the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blessings&#8230;&#8230;If you have powers from a special entity other than yourself, enter them in this section. For example, the knight (who is now a hero) who adventured with me in 『Stardust Light』 had the blessing of the Almighty God in his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Special armaments&#8230;&#8230;Literally, fill in this section if you have special weapons or armour. Riese  should have filled in this section. The sword she carries is imbued with special powers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other &#8230;. If there are any other characteristics that appeal to you as an adventurer that do not fall into the above three categories, enter them here. If you can use magic, it is standard practice to write &#8216;wizard&#8217; here. Magic is a skill that can only be used by those who have studied a special discipline, so there is no dedicated section for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I filled in this form as follows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Existence Power Level】 1</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Blessings】None.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Special Armament】 Depends on the occasion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Other】Confident in his connections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here you go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you,&#8230;..confident in your connections?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always get a tilt of the head with this description.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to be promoted to grade D and I&#8217;ll prove it right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The requirement for moving up to D level is to complete ten requests, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Same as the guilds in the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I can probably move up to D level right away, as planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d like to take on a request as soon as possible. May I ask you to introduce me to a search request?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Please wait a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist was very efficient in preparing the documents.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the clients of people-hunting requests are often individuals, the rewards are often inadequate or the request is cancelled due to a mistake. For this reason, the requests themselves are often unpopular and left unfulfilled &#8211; so-called &#8216;salted&#8217;. Guild officials would probably like to digest the requests as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, there are about 30 request forms. They must be sharing information with guilds in other branches. Not only the residents of the Royal Capital, but also missing persons from neighbouring villages and towns were requested to be searched.</span></p><<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. ─ I&#8217;ll get to the bottom of this soon.”</span></p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a quick look at each request and took out the communication stone in my pouch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lenovan?　It&#8217;s been a long time. &#8230;&#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s me, Ned. Sorry to come out of the blue, but did you see a couple of guys in the village you&#8217;re in last week?&#8230;.. Give me some details about those two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I make a note of the information on the paper in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saika, it&#8217;s been a year. I forgot to tell you, congratulations on winning the gladiatorial competition half a month ago. I just wanted to ask you, was there a red-haired girl who was doing menial work at that venue?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking notes again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see, Duke of Ruin&#8230;&#8230; Eh?　Do you already know what I want?&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s right. The quintessential 《clairvoyant》 Lord Ruin. Thank you for the information. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Yes?　Are you responsible for ruining your daughter&#8217;s marriage proposal?　Ha ha, I didn&#8217;t break that one, Lloyd did it on his own. See you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sharyn?　Sorry, that was sudden. Actually, there&#8217;s someone I want you to look for in the woods over there. I think he&#8217;s in an intricate area, so I need you to lend me your animal eyes. &#8230;&#8230; Okay. I&#8217;ll go with you as much as you want, even if it&#8217;s just to groom them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see, Eddie. I need to ask you for a favour…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Elaine. I need to ask you a few questions…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alec. I&#8217;m just…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Laurie. I want to ask you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Zeth…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eufa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Narc…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Notes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes. Take notes &#8211; take notes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; something like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before long, eight correspondence stones and a large quantity of notepaper were cluttered on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I organise the notepads properly and hand them to the receptionist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve completed all the requests I&#8217;ve received. Here is a summary of the subject&#8217;s whereabouts, contact details, safety, with a note.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-ha, yes. &#8230;&#8230;, please wait a moment!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist heads for the back room in a panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, other receptionists who were in the vicinity also entered the back room, perhaps because they were understaffed. Gradually, noisy voices can be heard coming from the room. The sound of flapping and busy footsteps kept echoing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About ten minutes had passed. The receptionist came in front of me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have confirmed the fulfilment of your request. Here is your reward and your&#8230;.adventurer card.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A bag full of notes and coins was placed on the counter with a thud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist then looks at me as if she still can&#8217;t believe what she sees and gently hands me my card.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The card stated that I was a Grade D adventurer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After promotion to grade D.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the two female knights waiting for me at the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to keep you waiting. I&#8217;ll take your request then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;No, no, wait. Wait a minute. Didn&#8217;t you just do a lot of quest&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May asks, puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese  is not surprised, having seen this scene once. For some reason, she was proud as she drank her tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just involved with a lot of people while May hones her sword skills. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-is that so?&#8230;&#8230; No, I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s not true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, May seemed convinced, but her doubts were soon rekindled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As always, you have low self-esteem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who was listening to the conversation, tells me with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve adventured all over the world as a member of the White Dragon Chivalric Order, and you&#8217;re the only one who can pull off a trick like that, Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s what they tell me&#8230;..After all, I&#8217;m only borrowing someone else&#8217;s help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least I don&#8217;t help everyone, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells me shortly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t intend to have such low self-esteem. I have a good memory for the results I&#8217;ve achieved. But I&#8217;m talking about the fact that not all of them were achieved by myself, but by someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will not be haughty about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I act as if someone else&#8217;s achievements are my own &#8211; that will surely be the end of the line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Ned. One thing I&#8217;ve been wondering, &#8230;&#8230; if you can make so much money, you don’t need us to help you with your requests right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May questioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We don&#8217;t always get requests for people-hunting stuff. Unlike monsters, they&#8217;re easier to counteract and&#8230;&#8230; we can&#8217;t rely on them all the time.&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are inevitably limits to what can be done to combat monsters. However, it is easy to take countermeasures against disappearances and lost persons, for example, by warning people around them and putting up signs on the roads where they are likely to get lost. As long as the lords are decent, the more requests that come in, the more measures should gradually be put in place. This would naturally lead to a decrease in the number of requests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, people like me should earn when they can. Now is the time to earn it, with Riese  and May, two reliable collaborators.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now &#8230;&#8230; let&#8217;s discuss which requests to take on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of us look at the noticeboard set up in the guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A large number of requests were posted on the notice board. The ones we&#8217;re going to take on this time are the relatively well-paid defeat type amongst the numerous requests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was thinking that the two of us, me and Riese , could take on the regular wyverns &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I point to the request form posted on the notice board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With the addition of&#8230;&#8230;May , there are now three of us, and we will take on the task of defeating these three Red Wyverns.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Red Wyvern!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May exclaimed in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Red Wyverns are a higher species of wyvern. The conditions for receiving a request are therefore also [three or more people and an average rank of B or higher].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese  is an S-level adventurer, so she should be able to take it. But that won&#8217;t be long, so&#8230;&#8230;we&#8217;ll also take on the ten ogres over here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute!　Ned!　Come here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meir grabbed me by the neck and moved me towards the corner of the guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“OOuu, You&#8217;re killing me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told May in a desperate swashbuckling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s Lady Riese, I&#8217;m just a Kingsguard knight! I don&#8217;t intend to lose to any knights, but I just can&#8217;t if it&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;Red Wyvern!　That a monster can be  selected by few, even A-level adventurers, can be defeated!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yes, but &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And an ogre, not one, but ten!　Impossible!　I&#8217;m going to die!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May said, with tears in the corners of her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have been mentally exhausted when she was in the same room with Riese . There was no sign of the usual coolness in May now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, if I became a deadweight, in the unlikely event that I will fail the quest with it. I&#8217;ll tarnish Lady Riese’s perfect career..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t know you were thinking of that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s too hard to be true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not that Riese is perfect, either. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where&#8217;s the imperfection?! Seeing it with my own eyes, I&#8217;m thinking more and more that Lady Riese  is perfect! That beautiful demeanour for an S-class adventurer!　The noble aura emanating from her entire body! Presence! &#8230;&#8230;Oh, I really admire&#8230;&#8230;from the bottom of my heart!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May says with an ecstatic expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, for May, Riese is really a heavenly person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But from my point of view, who knows Riese well&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;where you can&#8217;t see it, she’s far from perfect.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mutter in a low volume that May cannot hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, I knew one fatal flaw of Riese&#8217;s. But I hesitate to tell May about it. I feel a little sorry to destroy the beautiful illusion of Riese in May&#8217;s mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Even if you are a liability, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d have a problem with Riese&#8217;s abilities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m sorry about that. I feel like I&#8217;m relying on you all the time&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If she says it&#8217;s okay, then it&#8217;s okay, alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I look at Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who had been listening to our conversation in silence, nodded firmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t mind at all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, then it&#8217;s decided.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus began our adventure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Red Wyvern was to be transported by horse-drawn carriage to the location where it was sighted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the time the vehicle enters the forest near the Royal Capital, the road surface becomes rougher and the vehicle body shakes more often. As the vision shakes with clangs and thumps, May, sitting opposite me, keeps lowering her gaze with a hard expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; May. Why don&#8217;t you calm down for a minute?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-there&#8217;s no way I can calm down&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May takes one look at Riese, who is sitting next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have admired Riese a lot. Meir&#8217;s nervousness was tremendous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to take a little air from outside!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The coach door opens as if to escape, and May steps out, as if she has reached the limit of her nervousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time I saw her, that was running somewhere, and me and Riese watched her from the window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mail is sure energetic.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope it doesn&#8217;t spin out of control&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than being over the top, May seem half nervous and half excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I&#8217;ve always wanted to ask you, what brought you to the Kingdom of Enuvidia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, I hadn&#8217;t explained it yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll give you the short version…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her, as briefly as I could, what had happened so far. However, Riese and I had known each other for a long time and had exchanged communications several times, so there was not much new information. The only thing I had to tell her was what His Majesty had told me at the Royal Castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. So you were kicked out of the hero&#8217;s party. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I explained everything, Riese gave me a sympathetic look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. must have been a complicated time for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not that complicated&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to put up with it. I know your past.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It weakens me when people say that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese and I have never formally gone on adventures in the same party. But the time we met was a long time ago. So she knows my situation to some extent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumu, is this finally my turn?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, sitting next to me, quickly moved her body closer to mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our thighs touch each other. I heard the sound of armour clicking and rubbing against each other&#8217;s. Because Riese is tall, her shoulders are at the same height as my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a bad feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;&#8230;, if you&#8217;re in the mood for some pampering, I&#8217;ll lend you my breasts as much as you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She whispered softly in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A chill ran down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t hold back. I&#8217;m removing the breastplate now, just give me a minute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seriously, stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu, you&#8217;re still as shy as ever&#8230;&#8230;Come on, I&#8217;ve taken it off. Jump in anytime. I&#8217;ll give you some warmth and…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you to stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese  removed her breastplate at an unusual speed and slammed my hand sword into Riese&#8217;s head, who was ready to hold on to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese looks disappointed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re a dull man, &#8230;&#8230; and you&#8217;re causing my needs to build up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I run my hand over my forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve told you many times, &#8230;&#8230; you need to fix that pampering personality of yours as soon as possible. It&#8217;s not nice for those of us who get involved.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even I have said many times that it&#8217;s an impossible proposition. It&#8217;s my natural disposition&#8230;&#8230;, or shoul I say, proclivity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese  put one hand in front of her chest, smiled proudly. What other woman could so confidently reveal her proclivities?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a deep sigh.</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/p100-720x1024.png"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Riese Von Aldiana has strong maternal instincts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Specifically, she has a strong desire to pamper younger men. This is a fact known only to some people close to Riese. Riese is now 21 and I am 18. Although there is only a three-year age difference between us, it seems that I am enough of an object of sexual desire for Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s scary is that&#8230;..Riese will try to fulfil her needs in an unobtrusive way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her usual expression and her usual tone of voice, she searches for an outlet for her needs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are all these weirdos around me &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The answer is simple. Birds of the same feather flock together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that logic holds true, then Riese and I are the same kind of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Give me a break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Your fellow members of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』must be annoyed by your proclivities, aren&#8217;t they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, they don&#8217;t. I keep it hidden in front of outsiders. And they say, [Well, it&#8217;s fine if it&#8217;s on Ned.]”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why am I the target&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They have my back too, which is why I&#8217;ve decided not to hold back against Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. I need to rethink my relationship with the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 once and for all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the leader is the leader, then the members of the group are the members of the group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I distance myself from that party a little?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the end of the &#8230;&#8230; world when a woman like this is the object of admiration for the knights.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care what people think of me. I am me. &#8230;&#8230; So if you&#8217;re heartbroken, take it easy on me. Shall I pat you on the head?　Or would you prefer a lap pillow?　I&#8217;m carrying ear buds just in case this happens.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t need either of them, and I&#8217;m ditching those ear buds.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I flicked away Riese&#8217;s approaching hand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Please, I beg you, please control yourself.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, just get your breastplate back on. It&#8217;s a pain in the eye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yare,Yare…I went out of my way to remove it for you. &#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re a troublesome man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s in your head that you can&#8217;t help it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the breastplate removed, Riese&#8217;s upper half of her body was in a single piece of underwear, thinner than a swimming costume, clearly revealing her voluptuous body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly I feel tired. My head felt heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out another sigh, and then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m back. I looked around, but I still can&#8217;t seem to find the monster…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who had been outside, returns to the carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, May’s eyes widened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the narrow carriage. Me and Riese are so close together that our skin is touching. And Riese&#8217;s appearance is not something that can be shown to others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yo-youuuuu! What the hell are you doing to Lady Riese?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the other way round&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but hold my head up. I was the one who was going to be the subject of such things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent enough time stopping the carriage and going to the trouble of clearing up a misunderstanding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battle with the Red Wyvern has begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both wyverns and dragons have horned heads, large wings and long tails, but their properties differ only in their similar shapes. The wyvern&#8217;s body is one size smaller than that of the dragon, and unlike the dragon, it is not protected by tough scales, so it is a monster that can be defeated if we can find a chance to win if we strike it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike dragons, wyverns do not have reason, and their movements are linear, like those of beasts. In other words, it is easy to anticipate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the three Red Wyverns screaming in the sky in front of her, May readied her sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, are you getting the hang of it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. As Ned said, the moment they come down is the moment to attack.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Red wyverns are belligerent but have no way of attacking enemies at a distance. Therefore, the wyverns always go down to the ground once to attack us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, they are coming.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who was in the lead, was targeted by the Red Wyvern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A giant wyvern  looms from the sky. At first, May was frightened, but she finally became accustomed to its speed and this time she avoided the wyvern&#8217;s claws with minimal movement──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slashes at the Red Wyvern&#8217;s torso.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wyvern screamed and ran away into the sky. However, the wounds seem to have been deep and he soon crashed. We&#8217;ll have to check on it later, but from the looks of it, we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;ll be able to defeat it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Ned&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While watching the battle, May unexpectedly approached him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, what is your relationship with Lady Riese?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a question that had been asked many times already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Letting out a sigh, I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you still care?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I care!　You let Lady Riese dress like that in such a small, closed room&#8230;&#8230;.!　And when I looked closer, I could see that Riese didn&#8217;t look too happy about it either. &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is a sharper observer than I thought but for the wrong reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I much prefer that she used it for combat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here comes the second Red Wyvern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, stop trying to derai──── Uwa it&#8217;s really here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had hoped that working together with Riese would raise her aspirations as a knight, but if this is the case, will it have the opposite effect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh──this!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May quickly held her sword vertically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She placed her palm on the blade and caught the oncoming Red Wyvern&#8217;s claws. Immediately afterwards, she deflected the impact at an angle. The Red Wyvern&#8217;s claws slide down the blade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, you &#8230;&#8230;!　You really don&#8217;t do anything, do you &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can do it, but you&#8217;re dragging your feet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;Damn!!!　Hold still!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May said with a blue streak on her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although May had said many times in the guild that it was [impossible] and she would [die], when it came to fighting, she was quite a good fighter. It is not so easy to defeat her, the Red Wyvern is also unable to give May a decisive blow. As a knight in her own right, May seems to be good at defending herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s got a good skill, as she was brought here by Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese, who was standing next to me before I knew it, says, looking at May&#8217;s fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s completely coincidental. She&#8217;s definitely promising, because she blocked a blow from the&#8230;.. Kraken with just a sword. And with that, she still has an existence power of three people.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was three? Instantly, she&#8217;s exerting the equivalent of existence force 4&#8230;&#8230; Hmm, she looks like he could turn into a monster if she trained well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese observes the fighting May with a serious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she looked at her, I guessed what she was thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t mind if you&#8217;re just trying to build a friendship, but don&#8217;t be a scout. Mey is a favourite of Her Royal Highness Princess&#8230;..Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I understand. As always, you&#8217;re a good mind reader.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are some people in the world with whom you cannot have a conversation otherwise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;ll have a fight around here too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese draws her sword from its sheath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sword, drawn with a shrieking sound, was imbued with a pale light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, let&#8217;s change.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha, yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May distances herself from the wyvern. Fortunately, the wyverns seemed to be wary of our forces and did not attack those two at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here I go──”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese runs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment later, a slash of light sliced through the Red Wyvern&#8217;s giant body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is Riese&#8217;s special armoury &#8211; the Sword of Glorious Light and Great Radiance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This sword was created using materials from the monster known as the White Dragon, which is also the symbol of the adventurers&#8217; party, the White Dragon Chivalric Order. The sword, forged using the scales and fangs of the White Dragon, which governs light, is said to cut through all matter in a single, blinding flash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s Riese-sama&#8217;s battle &#8230;&#8230;, how divine &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is slightly over excited and glued onto Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flashes of light that gushed out were multi-layered, and a flower of light bloomed and spilled out onto the battlefield in front of her. Riese, at the centre of the scene, is bathed in multiple flashes of light and wields her sword gracefully, as if she were a stage actress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese&#8217;s existence powerlevel is 6&#8230;&#8230; and her physical strength is such that she can create craters in the ground with just a footstep and snap large trees with just her fists. The Sword of Elegance and the physical strength of existence 6. The combination of these two is a tremendous offensive force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned!　Look out!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard May shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked and saw a third Red Wyvern in the sky, aiming at me and rushing forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a huge trobule. If I were to be hit by that rush in the flesh, there would be no way I could survive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May was shouting but on the other hand, Riese was in no hurry at all, as if she trusted me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese stares at me silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you want me to prevent it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unnecessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a glance is all that is needed to complete the exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese had probably anticipated my response and was easily convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, which one shall I use?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand into the pouch and select the tool I want to take out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before I could take out the tool, I felt a strange sensation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My whole body glows faintly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Strange. I shouldn&#8217;t have done anything, but the light gradually became stronger and stronger&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a high &#8216;kiing&#8217; sound, the light propagated around them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wyvern that rushed forward was bounced by the wall of light that suddenly appeared and died in front of &#8230;&#8230; me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Red Wyvern that had lunged at me was dead, perhaps because it was badly hit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese cuts the one remaining wyvern in two and walks towards me immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The light you just saw is magic&#8230;..《Self-defence Garment Rula Shield》 that protects the target from enemy attacks. It is also a very high-level art. When did you prepare it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese asks me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I reminded her of recent events, but&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t remember preparing anything&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an involuntary pause, I replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Again, someone else took the liberty of putting it on. It&#8217;s probably Liz though, judging by the &#8230;&#8230; sensation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This sort of thing happens so often that when I registered with the guild, I wrote &#8216;it depends&#8217; in the special armaments section. Very unwillingly, I often have strange magic cast on me or strange equipment that I don&#8217;t even know I have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t Liz an active wizard in the heroes&#8217; party?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl can activate up to four hundred spells in parallel, &#8230;&#8230; and sometimes she&#8217;ll maintain a spell she cast on himself a long time ago that she&#8217;s forgotten about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can assure you that I have a good memory for any magic that has been cast on me. This [self-defence robe] was cast without permission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not complaining because it helped, but I do wish she would at least say a few words before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m telling them to stop because it&#8217;s bad for my heart. &#8230;&#8230; For some reason, people just won&#8217;t stop doing this. Every wizard, every time I see them, they cast spells on my body without my permission, and they want to overwrite the spells cast on my body with their own magic&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..that&#8217;s called marking &#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say, Riese?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s nothing. The less I know about Ned the better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think she mumbled something as shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, you&#8217;ve now accomplished the first request. Let&#8217;s get the rest of the ogre and be done today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all requests have been fulfilled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned to the Adventurers Guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to say thank you to both of you. I&#8217;m going to report back on the completion of the requests, so you two can wait here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the counter to deliver the items that would serve as evidence of the request, as I was accustomed to doing. I took the claws of three Red Wyverns and the horns of ten Ogres from their respective pouches.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May and Riese, seated at the table, watched Ned&#8217;s fumbling about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lady Riese . Thank you for working with us today. It was a great learning experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May bowed deeply to Riese, who sat opposite her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese then smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the looks of it, you seem to have relaxed some of your nerves.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So sorry. I’m finally getting used to it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When they first met, May was unusually nervous. May felt embarrassed when she remembered it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Lady Riese. If it&#8217;s difficult for you to answer, you don&#8217;t have to answer&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After May’s nerves eased as she completed the request, May asked Riese what had been bothering her for some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;why would someone of your stature be cooperating with Ned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have always wondered. Riese is one of the most famous adventurers in the country and must be very busy at all times. Despite this, Riese went out of her way to make time for Ned and cooperated with the request. She didn&#8217;t show any displeasure &#8230;&#8230; but, on the contrary, she was full of motivation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because I owe him more than I can ever repay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a clear voice, Riese told May. What is it that Riese, the leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, that she can&#8217;t repay him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from May&#8217;s deepening doubts, Riese does not explain anything further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, she tells her something else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even without past indebtedness, Ned is a man you want to push higher&#8230;&#8230; His motto [Using other people&#8217;s power] is easier said than done.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat proudly, Riese told May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned has had its share of extraordinary struggles and setbacks, and as a result he chose to live that way&#8230;.. I cooperate with that way of life because I respect it from the bottom of my heart.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Respect, is it? &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May realised that Riese has the same feelings towards Ned that she has towards Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it was &#8211; May couldn&#8217;t imagine that. It is true that Ned has its own strength and she already has a certain respect for it. However, it is difficult to say whether she respects him as much as he respects Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, Ned&#8217;s power is only using other people&#8217;s power, no matter how far he pushes it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be possible to appreciate it as a rarity, but when it comes to respecting it from the bottom of one&#8217;s heart, as Riese says, it is unlikely to be possible at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll find out sooner or later, May. How proud you would be to wield a sword for that man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese looks at May with eyes that seem to see through her mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few dozen seconds later, Ned returns from the counter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I&#8217;ve kept you waiting. I&#8217;ve got your reward.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that&#8217;s a lot of money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That way we won&#8217;t have to worry about splitting it up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeat of three Red Wyverns and ten Ogres.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When May and Rushia saw the reward money for each, they had their own reactions. Unlike May, who is genuinely surprised, Riese is already thinking about splitting the money. For Riese, the leader of the White Dragon Knights, this level of reward is probably not a big deal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My share should be ten percent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing my words, May was surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not going to be so thick-skinned as to suggest a three-way split here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the battle, I was just standing behind, doing nothing. There were a few irregularities caused by the self-defence robe, but I don&#8217;t think you can call those my achievements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I want the rewards to be in the same proportion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese says with a serious expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I wasn&#8217;t about to give in so easily, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese. You should only get what you deserve for your work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. Then I&#8217;ll deposit the larger amount in the guild, addressed to you at a later date. I&#8217;ll spend the money I get however I want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Oi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she is going to go to that length, there is no way for me to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May looked at me with surprised eyes when I couldn&#8217;t say anything back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even Ned can be talked down to by someone &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve been with Ned for very long.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese said proudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she turned a little more serious and looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned has been a great help to us on a regular basis, providing us with information, negotiations and consultations. We just want to repay that debt&#8230;&#8230;take this as the consensus of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Understood. Then I&#8217;ll split it equally with Riese.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then May, who was sitting next to Riese, also opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll split it equally. Originally, the purpose of today was to help Ned, and as far as rewards are concerned, It’s too much. Besides, &#8230;&#8230; if I get paid more here, Princess Rushia will be angry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no way to get around this when May brought up Her Royal Highness the Princess Rushia .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my lips are drawn back in a tight line, May smiles a little triumphantly. She seems happy to have beaten me to the punch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. then, we&#8217;ll divide it into three equal parts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want a reward either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they say I can have it, I&#8217;ll have it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia , it feels so good to talk against Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know what you mean&#8230;&#8230; Well, I&#8217;m sure he will just donate the larger amount to somewhere else anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May rolls her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese , with a knowing look, launches a question at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How’s the four orphanages run by Ned now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Five. The number has increased again recently. This time I&#8217;m donating there.!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You also had the mercenary soldiers&#8217; group, didn&#8217;t you?　What happened to that one?　I haven&#8217;t heard anything about it recently. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They went to the Republic in the east. For convenience, they&#8217;ve changed their name to the Order of the Knights, so Riese just doesn&#8217;t realise it, but they&#8217;re still reasonably prominent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s eyes widened when I and Riese conversed like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,oi… doesn&#8217;t that mean Ned actually has tremendous power?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just being facetious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Tl: I don’t think it’s the right word but I could not think any, so here’s the raw:</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> ただ顔が広いだけだ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reflexively told May my customary response, because that&#8217;s what people say to me sometimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Riese  immediately drowns out my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s about time you understood, May, that you shouldn&#8217;t take what the internet says at times like this seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese might not be on my side, she might be my enemy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The statement was so unintentional that I couldn&#8217;t help but think.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I felt a tremor from inside my pouch.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open the pouch, which makes a small clattering sound, and one of the communication stones reports an incoming call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Princess?”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surface of the stone was marked Iris Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I&#8217;ve got a bit of a comms call, I&#8217;ll have to go outside for a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who&#8217;s on the other end?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess of the Kingdom of Intail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up from my chair, answering Rushia&#8217;s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s strange when you can casually communicate with the princess of &#8230;..one country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome to this side of the world, May. You&#8217;ll never be bored with that man. But be careful&#8230;&#8230; because if you&#8217;re not careful, he can twist your common sense.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard some harsh words behind my back that I couldn&#8217;t quite accept, but I decided to ignore them because it will bring trouble taking them seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Out on the comms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned-sama!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A familiar bright voice sounded from across the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Long time no see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes!　It&#8217;s been a long time!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The princess of the Kingdom of Intail is apparently full of energy today. If she had a dog&#8217;s tail, she would be swinging wildly right now. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it okay if she communicates with me? Isn’t His Majesty stopping you in any way?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s all right!　I&#8217;m communicating with you properly and away from your father&#8217;s surveillance!　This level of adversity will not tear me and Ned-sama apart!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s great.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has the bravery not to do as His Majesty says and the brains to avoid unnecessary conflict.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a reputation as a noble woman, so much so that many people are afraid to speak to her, but if you take her royal abilities and position out of the equation, she is just a bright, talkative girl of her age. However, she is usually busy with her official duties. The fact that she has communicated in this way suggests that she may be on urgent business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『There have been some changes in the Kingdom of Intail since Ned-sama has departed, so I thought I&#8217;d let you know just in case.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s helpful. I know about the movements of the heroic parties from the newspapers and so on, so you can skip that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I understand.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn&#8217;t an urgent matter, but it was information I knew I would have to ask sooner or later. I have known the princess for a long time. She must have read my thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『First of all, I would like to talk about the personnel changes at the castle. Treasurer Joaldahl has left the castle. It seems that my father and the Prime Minister had a disagreement when they decided to use taxpayers&#8217; money to pay for the damages caused by the brave party.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. If the&#8230;&#8230;treasurer really leaves the country, tell him to contact me. I should at least be able to refer him to his next job.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I knew you would say that, Ned-sama, so I have already given him the communication stone.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quite a deft hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I know everything there is to know about Master Net!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Former Treasurer Joaldahl is not only highly competent, but also a good man with a good personality and is well-liked. From a financial point of view, there is no harm in making a favour out of him, and &#8230;&#8230; even without calculation, he is a person whom I genuinely want to help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Next, there have been some developments in the military…』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Princess continues to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my notebook,to note any necessary information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The Cardinal&#8217;s position has changed and it may affect the orphanage we run.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed, it might&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation went on to the orphanage I run.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It reminded me of the children who run free in the small orphanage&#8230;&#8230;idyllic village in the countryside of the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad. I always leave you in charge of the orphanage.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『No!　Originally, that orphanage was run by me and Ned-sama, &#8230;&#8230; and it&#8217;s a nice break for me to play with the orphanage children.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I appreciate you saying so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The children have been asking to see Ned-sama too.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have about five orphanages, but I rarely turn up. I just check on them regularly through correspondence, like this time, and send them the necessary funds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was feeling close to resignation, thinking that the children must think of me as a very cold man, but according to the princess, that is not the case. But it may just be a comforting thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it sounds like a lot has happened since then.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes. Truly, since Master Net left the country, things have been very noisy&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed as if the Princess&#8217;s words had been cut off abruptly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『─ ─Oh Right!!　Ned-sama!!　Why are you in the Kingdom of Enuvidia?　I never heard that you were leaving the country!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Iris suddenly raised her voice and I moved the communication stone a little further away from my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she knew everything about me.　Refrain from the rush that is&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa–aaa&#8230;..my bad. But I felt like if I told you, you&#8217;d stop me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Of course!　Ned-sama rarely comes home!　At the very least, I would have liked to talk to you a bit more!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If we want to talk, we are talking right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I wanted to talk to you face to face!』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry about that. But if I missed the timing, His Majesty was likely to take notice of me, so I had no choice but to do it this one time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By now, His Majesty is probably worrying about what the hero party is up to. I had a hard time dealing with them myself, so it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t feel sympathy for him, but he deserved what he got, so I&#8217;ll leave them alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On a different note, is Emma the diplomat over there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Is Emma here?&#8230;.. No, she haven&#8217;t returned from the country she was sent to yet, what happened?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not like that, but &#8230;&#8230; that diplomat is familiar with my activities in other countries because she&#8217;s been going around to other countries. She&#8217;s usually very tight-lipped, but given the circumstances, I thought maybe she might have something to say to His Majesty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Do you want me to keep &#8230;&#8230; quiet?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Don’t. I’m sure His Majesty and the Prime Minister will search me sooner or later. I shall consider &#8230;&#8230;this is the right time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m no longer in the Kingdom of Intail anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they know something, it won&#8217;t affect my own life that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Speaking of which, one thing about father has been bothering me.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Princess said as if she remembered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Earlier, the Prime Minister was investigating the Kingdom of Enuvidia on father&#8217;s instructions. Perhaps he is planning &#8230;&#8230; something.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are they plotting something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my eyebrows at those words, which I found disturbing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few hours earlier, at the Royal Castle in the Kingdom of Intail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister rushed into the King&#8217;s office in a state of panic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your Majesty!　Report!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want to hear it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The heroes have destroyed the town again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaaahhhh!!!&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king exclaimed, abandoning his dignity. He fell from his luxurious chair and held his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While sympathising with the king, the Prime Minister continued his report.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“According to reports, the hero party engaged the Demon King&#8217;s men in the middle of the Edwin Mine. However, in the aftermath of the battle, a massive landslide occurred. Fortunately, the wizard Liz evacuated the inhabitants, so there were no casualties. &#8230;&#8230; They saved the inhabitants, but did not protect the town at all&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do they fight like that!　Can&#8217;t they be a bit more aware of their surroundings, those bastards!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The king already knew that from the first report and put his hand to his forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bring me the communication stone!　I&#8217;m going to talk to Julius!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Julius is down with depression.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King stomped hard on the floor but it was Julius who had fallen down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn the damned &#8230;&#8230;!　What are the others doing now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pretty much the same as last time. The hero has disappeared somewhere again and the warrior has gone to challenge the legendary monsters that inhabit the mountain tops. The wizard is deep in his cave, absorbed in the development of new magic, and the monk is celebrating every day by raising the dead in the cemetery.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re having a lot of fun  without even knowing the trouble they caused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s true, they don&#8217;t want to follow Julius&#8217;s instructions, do they?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Yes. As always, they want Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King frowned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One point must be acknowledged. The influence of Ned was stronger than he had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s kill Ned and end this, once and for all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a whisper, the king muttered in a small voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is no way a man like that, with no redeeming qualities, could control the hero party&#8230;&#8230;.is it brainwashing?, or is he blackmailing them by taking advantage of their weakness? &#8230;&#8230;In any case, if we are dragged along by that man forever, we should just erase his existence. That way, the hero members of the party will cool down a bit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But isn&#8217;t that a bit extreme?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be a fool!　After all, he&#8217;s the one who assembled the original Hero Party!　He is responsible for the actions of that party! Considering the damage that has been done, it is a mortal sin that he fully deserves the maximum penalty!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The King shouted in a show of anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I didn&#8217;t like that man before!　I&#8217;ll never forgive that brat who shamed my daughter&#8230;.!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(TL: I guess he has more than 1 daughter?) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s how you really feel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prime Minister lets out a small sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But how do we proceed to kill Ned? I was informed that Ned is already out of the country&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I believe he&#8217;s in the Kingdom of Enuvidia now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They already knew where Ned was. The guards stationed in the port town had reported that he had boarded a ship bound for the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I have a good idea. &#8230;&#8230; because the Kingdom of Enubidia owes our country a great debt.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see. You intend to use that one.”</span></p>
