<h3>Chapter 2 - Poisonous Demon Dragons. </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the Adventurers Guild with three equal rewards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mm &#8230;&#8230;? A transmission from Rushia-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, May takes out a communication stone from her armour and holds it close to her ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, May finishes communicating and looks at me while putting the stone away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, Rushia-sama wants you to come to the castle. She wants to ask you for a favour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A favour from me?&#8230;&#8230;okay, let&#8217;s go there right away.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to book an inn now, but if Her Royal Highness has summoned me, that should be my priority. Besides, there are many inns in this town. Even if I make a detour, it is unlikely to be fully booked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have to go and meet my party members after this. I have to say goodbye to you both here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As May and I were about to head for the castle, Riese stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, too, think we should take a break today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese, thank you for your help today. If there&#8217;s anything else I can do, please let me know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese-sama!　Thank you for giving me a valuable experience today!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May bowed deeply next to me as I thanked Riese  lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese smiles softly at her and turns on her heel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;.. really, it was a priceless experience today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was quite nervous at first, I wondered how it was going to go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-don&#8217;t say that. I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be that nervous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May says, blushing slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together, May and I then walked to the royal castle where Princess Rushia was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sun has already set and a chilly breeze caresses my cheeks. There are many bars in the vicinity of the Adventurers&#8217; Guild, so noisy voices could be heard from everywhere. However, as we approach the castle, the atmosphere begins to quiet down. The royal castle seen in the daytime looked so bold and magnificent that it was no exaggeration to say that it was a symbol of authority.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, this way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I follow May&#8217;s lead and walk through the castle.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t this the same room as last time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. I&#8217;ve been asked to show you to the audience chamber.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This a strange thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The audience chamber is the place where royal authority is demonstrated to visitors. But I&#8217;ve already witnessed the true nature of Rushia-sama during my last visit. There should be no point in showing authority now&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The majestic door opened and I entered the audience chamber with May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a large room. The floor was polished to reflect the light and there were no unnecessary ornaments around. The simplicity of the scene gave it a unique sense of power. A large window, a large staircase and a large chair. All emphasised the presence of royalty sitting at the back of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Armed knights stood silently on either side of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere was suddenly tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia-sama, sitting on a luxurious chair, looked at me and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first time I saw her this stern, I felt a sense of discomfort before I even bowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Rushia-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was different from the Rushia-sama with whom we had previously conversed throughout the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked as if she was in dire straits, as if she was barely suppressing the pain in her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that you visited the Adventurers&#8217; Guild today, did you successfully register?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Thanks to May&#8217;s guidance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad to hear that.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The short chit chat comes to an end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a bad feeling. To have a peaceful conversation like this before the main subject. The main subject must not be peaceful at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s get down to business. I have a favour to ask of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia-sama spoked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you ever heard of a monster called the Poisonous Demon Dragon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Only what I&#8217;ve heard of &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I will explain it to you just in case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lucilla-sama began to tell her story.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The poisonous dragon was born in the northern part of the Kingdom of Enuvidia and, as its name implies, it is a dragon that possesses deadly poison. It is also the only dragon that the people of the Kingdom of &#8230;&#8230;Enuvidia do not believe in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another name for the Kingdom of Enuvidia is the country that is in bond with the dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The majority of the population considers dragons to be sacred. However, such people dare not believe in dragons&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Poison Demon Dragon is extremely ferocious and has been laying waste to our country since ancient times. The poisoned land is a source of all kinds of diseases and crops do not grow for a long time. The damage has been so great that countless deaths have already occurred.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a mysterious look on his face, Rushia continues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The damage caused by the Poisonous Demon Dragon soon spread not only to our country but also to other countries. They may not be as deadly as the Demon King, but the Poisonous Demon Dragon is also a monster recognised as a threat worldwide.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard of them too, if only by name. I&#8217;m sure most people have known about it.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if not as well-known as the Demon King,&#8230;&#8230; it is rare to find a monster that is that well-known.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would like you to take on the task of defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words were so unexpected that I involuntarily uttered a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can beat him, can you? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m told.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lucilla-sama&#8217;s mouth was full of implied statements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for me it was a request that was too absurd, as  I searched the words to reply, someone jumped in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia-sama!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forgive me for interrupting. But the other party is the Poisonous Demon Dragon&#8230;&#8230;and no matter how hard Ned tries, it&#8217;s not something that can be handled by an individual!　Have you forgotten that a year ago, despite forming an allied force with our neighbours, we were beaten back!&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I remember. Still, I hear that Ned can take it down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s attitude remains stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A year ago,&#8230;&#8230;I was on another continent. I had heard that several major battles had taken place in this area, but I had not investigated them in detail until now. Apparently, one of them was the battle over this Poisonous Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it look like I can defeat the Poison Demon Dragon to you, Rushia-sama?&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have heard information that&#8230;.you can defeat it.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And, who gave you this information?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I cannot say. I can&#8217;t tell you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia said with her eyes downcast with the answer being dodged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia apologised in a hushed voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am aware that I am saying harsh things. But&#8230;&#8230;I have my own reasons for not backing down&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like a child holding back tears, Rushia-sama says in a trembling voice, clutching her skirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please. I beg you to slay the Poisonous Demon Dragon. If you refuse to accept the task, then I will detain you until you do so.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clenching her fists and shaking off the pangs of conscience, Rushia-sama stared at me with eyes moistened with tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time as her declaration, the knights standing on either side of the room put their hands on the hilts of their swords.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I don&#8217;t agree with what Rushia-sama says here, she intends to restrain me immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait! You guys! What&#8217;s the meaning of this!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May asks the knights, looking puzzled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights were wearing the same armour as May. In other words, they are May&#8217;s colleagues. That seems to be why May cannot understand the situation in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May,we&#8217;ll tell you what&#8217;s going on later. So for now, you must cooperate with us and take that man into custody.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you can&#8217;t! We owe Ned!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give priority to Her Highness&#8217;s orders&#8230;&#8230;. Kingsguard knight May, what is your role?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At these words, May shut her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh-u&#8230;&#8230;!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Between her duty as a knight and human reason, May was torn between her duty as a knight and human reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A single line of blood dripped from her lips as she bit down hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do, I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is unlikely to help. No, perhaps she would move if I asked for help, but in her current state of mind, she wouldn&#8217;t be able to fight properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked again at Princess Rushia, the source of this incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look closely, her eyes are red and swollen. She must have been crying until just before&#8230;&#8230;.However, Princess Rushia, who had looked remorseful earlier, was now looking at me with eyes that held a strong will. Despite May&#8217;s dismay, Princess Rushia seems to have made up her mind.</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/p135-720x1024.png"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia. Unfortunately, I am one of the weaker adventurers. I can&#8217;t slay a poisonous demon dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I have heard that you are a good talker.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laugh. It was not going to persuade her, at least not on this occasion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t mean I can defeat the Poisonous Demon Dragon now, ──── which is, of course, impossible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I cannot agree to such a request.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The knights nearby drew their swords at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a quick decision. But Princess Rushia said she would restrain me. So I know, the knights have no intention of hurting me but their sword is a threat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to have to take a step back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, I took out a small sphere from inside my pouch and smashed it on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, the sphere cracks open and a large amount of white smoke shoots out from inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? A smoke screen?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t let him get away! Make sure he doesn’t escape!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the knights could surround me, I opened a nearby window and jumped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a grappling hook from my pouch and threw it at the ramparts directly in front of me. I made sure that the hook at the end caught a hollow in the wall, and landed on a distant scaffold while grabbing the rope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what an escape for your life, &#8230;&#8230;, you&#8217;re already surrounded&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shit! Chase him!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bustle of knights can be heard in the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m confident in my running skill. I would almost certainly be defeated if I had to fight alone. So I always have several ways to escape from this kind of situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I couldn&#8217;t  master escape techniques, so I decided to use my connections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out a communication stone from my pouch and contact someone I can rely on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese, I have an emergency. Please help me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Understood』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese briefly expressed his cooperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks. In times like this, you really are a reliable partner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Where are you?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just outside the back door of the royal castle. I&#8217;m heading towards the guild.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I passed through a narrow alleyway, I heard a knight shout from behind me, [There he is!]  came a knight&#8217;s shout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is no time to worry about being seen. I went out onto the main street and ran straight through the streets lined with many stalls. Passers-by were astonished to see me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The composition is not good. I&#8217;m being chased by a knight, like a criminal on the run. I&#8217;m afraid that a righteous citizen might jump out at any moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I have to get out of this situation as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ned. Is the enemy an entity that can be defeated?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a little troubled by that question, which I heard from the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The opponents are the knights of the Kingdom of Enuvidia. however, the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』are an adventurer party based in this country. &#8230;&#8230;It would only be a loss for both sides if the kingdom and the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 were to become enemies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.keep it under control. And leave as little evidence as possible that Riese did it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Understood. It seems like a sticky situation.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for understanding so quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I agree with Riese. This case is really fishy. The attitude of Princess Rushia is also worrying, and the fact that it happened at this time is also worrying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Seven seconds later, bow your head.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Riese&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put the comms stone back in the pouch and stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“o,o-kay&#8230;.., we managed to catch up with you&#8230;..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t resist, &#8230;&#8230;! Stay put, stay still &#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two knights approach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They must have run all the way here. I feel a little sorry for them, with sweat dripping from their chins and breathing on their shoulders &#8211; but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;d better grit your teeth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A moment after the knights tilted their heads, a flashlight slashes flashed behind them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two knights, blown away with great force, pass right over me as I bow my head, and finally crash into the wall, motionless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank God.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s no trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked Riese, who was coming leisurely from in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, are you sure you&#8217;re not in trouble?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Were you scared? Did you miss me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not scared nor lonely. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Oi, don&#8217;t casually pat my head.&#8217;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all right. I missed you, by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know, I would say&#8230;&#8230;,but as a person who has been helped, I would like to reward her somewhat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to stop resisting and let her pat my head for a while. The beautiful blonde hair grazes the tip of my nose and tickles me. When I breathed in, I could smell the faintest hint of sweet perfume.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese&#8217;s movements, which had been gently stroking my head, gradually became more intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Riese sniffs and looks excited &#8211; and then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I can&#8217;t take it anymore. Let me just hold you a little longer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t. You once said that and you didn&#8217;t let go of me all day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed her shoulders and Riese looked disappointed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;weren&#8217;t those guys who were chasing Ned earlier the knights of this country? What happened to them?&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know either, &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I did was to tell Riese what Princess Rushia talked about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Riese does not seem to have any idea of Princess Rushia&#8217;s leopard-change attitude, and she looks at me strangely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re still a troublemaker.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. don&#8217;t make it sound like it&#8217;s my fault.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m certainly aware that I&#8217;m a troublemaker, but that can&#8217;t be helped as I come into contact with all sorts of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am used to trouble. However, this time there are many unexplained points and it is impossible to move without being careless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To ask a single Ned to take down a poisonous demon dragon is not an ordinary thought by any stretch of the imagination. There must be a reason for this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“..I agree.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod my head in agreement to Riese&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“During the brief conversation, it seems that Princess Rushia doesn&#8217;t believe that I can defeat the Poison Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm. Despite that, she forced you to slay the Poisonous Demon Dragon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. In other words&#8230;..her real purpose is something else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the goal is to defeat a poisonous demon dragon, it should be left to someone more trustworthy than me. That is exactly what the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, the proud adventurer party of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, should be doing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Princess Rushia did not do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The objective&#8230;is to put me up against the Poison Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and the Poison Demon Dragon fighting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps that is the objective in itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t understand. Why would Princess Rushia do such a thing to you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know. If we can figure that out, we might find some possibilities for persuasion&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you do something wrong?　You didn&#8217;t force her into skinship, did you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t put me the same you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would never do that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other party is royalty. I was having a nice conversation and I was trying to be considerate on top of that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Cool your head Ned.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why does Princess Rushia want me to fight the Poison Demon Dragon?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or, better still &#8211; agree to defeat the Poisonous Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Riese . If we mobilise the entire 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, can we defeat the poisonous dragon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Impossible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer is immediate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are good at physical attacks, but poison dragons are a bad match for us. It&#8217;s an impregnable fortress, and even approaching it you&#8217;ll be hit by a deadly poison.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; You speak as if you&#8217;ve fought one before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I have. In fact, I fought there a year ago.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese goes on to explain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A coalition army was formed from volunteers from neighbouring countries to defeat the Poisonous Demon Dragon. The 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 also took part in that battle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like May said. They formed a coalition army and took on the Poisonous Demon Dragon, but were beaten back. &#8230;&#8230;Riese seems to have taken part in that battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We were very close, but we received more damage than we expected, so we had to retreat&#8230;.That was quite a hell. Hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, paralysis and excruciating pain. Some had sores on their skin, others vomited blood endlessly. Some were left with permanent injuries. I realised that&#8230;&#8230;poisoning is such a terrible thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I wouldn&#8217;t want to experience that for the rest of my life if I could.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The description is graphic. These are the words of someone who has really witnessed the scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think I could stand it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatever it is, first I want to know what Princess Rushia&#8217;s intentions are. The quickest way to do that is to talk to her directly, but&#8230;..now that this has happened, it&#8217;s difficult to go and see her, so what should I do&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I organise my thoughts out loud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Riese opened her mouth as if she had thought of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned. I&#8217;ve got an odd idea&#8230;..or rather I remembered”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese tells me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meet our collaborators.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; collaborator?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, there&#8217;s someone in that castle that you once saved&#8230;&#8230;He once came all the way to the『White Dragon Chivalric Order』 to thank you for saving him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;that happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone I saved in the past. I can&#8217;t remember who the other person is from that information alone, but it&#8217;s deeply moving to know that my past actions are helping me now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he is in the castle, he might be able to help me meet with Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a proposal I should get on board with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, introduce me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way to the castle again, Riese was talking to her collaborators on the communication stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her to give me a rundown of when and where  we would meet up, what the security situation was in the castle, and so on. Eventually, Riese  put the communication stone inside her armour and looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The arrangements have been made. The rendezvous point is in the kitchen of the castle&#8217;s main dining hall. It can be reached quickly by using the servants&#8217; entrance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. Just don&#8217;t go in there carelessly or we&#8217;ll definitely get caught &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese smiled wryly, as if she had guessed what I was trying to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess that&#8217;s where I come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Aaa. I&#8217;ll leave it to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The division of roles was done naturally. Since we had known each other for a long time, communication was smooth and easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking through a narrow alleyway, trying not to be spotted by the surrounding knights, I found a small stall. It seems to be a shop specialising in clothing. The royal city has many tourists, so there must be a high demand for goods useful for travelling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese, I need you to be on the lookout. I&#8217;d like to stop by that shop for a while”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A shop? Wouldn&#8217;t it be safer if I went there to buy something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese won&#8217;t do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her shortly and headed for the shop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The owner, who has a scruffy beard, immediately notices I entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome, Onii-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need one of these black outer coats.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This one? I think it&#8217;s a bit big for you&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here you go. I&#8217;ll leave the money here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t waste my time, so I got what I wanted and left the shop as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I met up with Riese again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese, put this on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s fine, but&#8230;&#8230;why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re the leader of the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』, you can&#8217;t just go out and fight the castle knights, can you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, I see what you mean. I forgot about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Riese bought it directly, it would be traced back to me, so I took the risk and bought it myself just now. This kind of clean-up is highly recommended for my job, so I&#8217;m going to take care of it now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Wait. Come to think of it, isn&#8217;t this the first time you&#8217;ve received a gift from Ned?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..come to think of it, it might be.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected it&#8217;s complicated. I&#8217;ll demand a do-over when things are done.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All right, all right. I&#8217;ll do whatever you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you say anything?　Does that mean I can ask you to sleep with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Goods only. We’ll discuss this later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m tired. Not&#8230;..my body, but my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Basically, S-level adventurers can beat most enemies, and many of them have a low sense of urgency. Strictly speaking, they are more insensitive than lacking a sense of crisis. For those who have overcome all kinds of hardships, crises that cause them to panic rarely occur.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this royal city, where the night&#8217;s curtains have fallen, Riese and I approach the castle under our breaths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Security was sparse the closer one got to the castle. It&#8217;s no wonder. No one would think that I, on the run, would ever return to the castle again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese, stay here. In 30 seconds, the operation will begin.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood. Good luck.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s my line.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I can’t fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always leave the fighting to someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">-Operation starts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirty seconds had passed when we went to the back door of the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A powerful sound of destruction was heard at the main gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese&#8217;s role is a diversion. She is to concentrate on luring out and neutralising the knights in the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While She’s doing that, I&#8217;ll go inside the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using a grappling rope, I quickly crossed the ramparts. While the knights in the vicinity are running towards the main gate, I head for the rendezvous point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This way, Ned-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I pass through the door, which had been unlocked beforehand, I hear a voice from somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of the corridor, a woman beckons from inside it. I make my way to that room without making a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you the collaborator Riese mentioned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I am. My name is Hersha, and I work as a servant here at the castle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After closing the kitchen door, the woman who introduced herself as Hersha bowed solemnly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably in her mid-twenties. She is tall and has a rather beautiful face with an interesting atmosphere. Her deep red hair is tied back, giving her a clean look. Her hairstyle is called a Gibson tuck. She was dressed in a black-and-white maid&#8217;s uniform with frills, which gave her a graceful appearance that would not look out of place working in a castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think Ned-sama remembers me&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. No, I do recognise you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stared into Hersha&#8217;s face, I searched the memories in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was about two years ago, I believe. It was a small village within a horse-drawn carriage ride of this royal capital&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Amazning..you’re right, you visited the village where I lived two years ago and killed the monsters that used to haunt the area. We only saw each other for a few seconds, but I never thought you would remember &#8230;&#8230; me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am good at remembering people&#8217;s faces.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her this, Hersha smiled softly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But two years ago, that&#8217;s not when I was active as &#8230;&#8230; the 『Stardust Light』, is it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. Before you became『Stardust Light』&#8230;&#8230;,it was  when you were one big shining mass, we were indebted to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In those days,I had a wide range of activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might have visited Hersha’s village and killed the monsters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry to bother you in your haste, but I just have one question&#8230;.are you hiding your true identity?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hersha asked me with a serious look on her face, while I was scratching the back of my hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just being modest. I&#8217;m not that desperate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. Not that I&#8217;m desperate &#8211; but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve had enough of playing&#8230;..the big, stupid tame tax.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..our hearts go out to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hersha bowed her head reverently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not very good at this subject. It&#8217;s time to get moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you&#8217;ve heard from Riese, but I want to meet Princess Rushia. Can you do it for me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I&#8217;m also the head maid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman who told me in such a calm tone made me open my eyes wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have come a long way from being a villager.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of us who have witnessed your exploits had our ambitions shaken in no small scale&#8230;..I am one of them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t decide whether it was a good influence or a bad influence, but at least for Hersha it seemed to be a good influence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let me show you the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I shall leave you here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hersha slowly bows her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She leads me to a place in front of the private chambers of Her Highness Princess Rushia. I should go alone from here onwards. I bow my head and express my gratitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s Ned-sama, you might be able to melt the frozen heart of Her Highness Princess Lucilla.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..? What does that mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I cannot answer your questions from my own mouth. For further information, please ask Her Highness or&#8230;. the Kingsguard Knight May.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Hersha turned on her heel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she quietly left, I suddenly heard a voice from inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..nn, ah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the girl&#8217;s&#8230;..painful voice that I heard from behind the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the quiet corridor, only that voice echoes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;&#8230;naaah! Ha..h..aha..ha&#8230;&#8230;Aaan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oi, oi,oi,oi────.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A frozen heart, did Hersha mean that kind of frustrated heart?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not strong enough to melt such a heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I almost stopped thinking, but now I&#8217;m being chased. This is no time to sit on my hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knock on the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“nAah? Wh-who’s there?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s me, Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait, wait-nanojya! Wait-nanojya!!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A slamming, noisy noise could be heard from behind the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited for about thirty seconds, but I could still hear the busy noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ It would be troublesome if she escaped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I don&#8217;t know what is being done behind the door, I can&#8217;t wait too long. If the knights of the castle found me, I’m back to square one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door with all my might.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuiiwaa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I saw was a startled girl on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was upturned, and her breasts and the bottoms of her feet were exposed due to her dishevelled clothing. Sweat was floating on her pure white skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-wh-wa-what, what do you want &#8230;&#8230;? And how did you get here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia asked, standing up and pointing at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she soon realised how she was dressed and hurriedly straightened her dishevelled clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll have to keep quiet about how I got here. The&#8230;&#8230; matter is, of course, about the defeat of the Poisonous Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have nothing to say!　Whether or not you&#8217;re willing to take on the job, that&#8217;s all that matters!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s always two sides of the same coin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, I tried to get closer to her, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waawh!? Wait, I&#8217;m against violence-jyaa!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia looked exaggeratedly frightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t come any closer! Don&#8217;t be violent.!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia tells me while holding one of her hands to her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, Princess Rushia said she is not good at fighting and conflict. So this situation is probably the most frightening situation for her. I understand that, but her attitude is too obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you pretending&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not pretending!　I mean, you!　You&#8217;re being rude!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And, you have no courtesy to show a man whom you suddenly try to restrain.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia was at a loss for words to reply, perhaps acknowledging that it was a good argument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;ll do exactly what I have to do, even if it&#8217;s against royalty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said this, I approached Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to punish any child who causes trouble for others. I&#8217;ll..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nyogo!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He dropped a hand chop on her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I&#8217;m taking it easy on her. My Existence Power Level 1, so I shouldn&#8217;t be that strong &#8211; but..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,uu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s beautiful eyes filled with tears as she looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaaーーーーーーnn!!! Mayーーー!! Mayーーー!! Come here ーーー!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s sobs echoed in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes had passed since May rushed to Princess Rushia&#8217;s cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding the situation, May put her hand to her forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re bolder than &#8230;&#8230; I thought you&#8217;d be, beating up royalty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The trick to get in terms with nobility and royalty is not to overplay your hand. You have to be very clear about what you need to say.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..sounds like you have a point, but you&#8217;re probably the only one who can dismiss it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes ago. May rushed to the room and closed the door the moment she saw a sobbing Rushia  and me next to her&#8230;.May has decided to protect me. Ostensibly I am still wanted, but at least she can be trusted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May looks at Princess Rushia  who has finally stopped crying with her eyes bright red and swollen, with sympathy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia-sama. If you don&#8217;t mind, let me give Ned an explanation from my mouth&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. No, I will explain. Now that it has come to this, it is quicker to tell Ned everything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia then slowly looks up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia looked at me with eyes filled with resignation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember I told you that the damage caused by the Poisonous Demon Dragon was not limited to the Kingdom of Enuvidia, but extended to other countries as well?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The nest of the poisonous dragons is in the Kingdom of Enubidia. So, normally, when the poisonous dragons cross over to other countries, they don&#8217;t stay there for long periods of time. But&#8230;&#8230;there has been one exception in the past.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a quiet voice, Princess Rushia said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A few years ago, the Poison Dragon Demon invaded the Kingdom of Intil, where it carried out its tyranny for about a month. The damage was so great that it has still not recovered&#8230;&#8230;and the Kingdom of Enuvidia was  held accountable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia spoke with a sombre face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I remember, about four or five years ago, there was a story about a rural town in the middle of nowhere that was completely destroyed by monsters. You&#8217;re talking about that, by any chance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s the one. Why didn&#8217;t you remember that until now, &#8230;&#8230; on the contrary, why didn&#8217;t you remember it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I was in another country at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I actively collect information about people, but also other information. I suppose because I often travel to other countries, I was fortunate enough not to have been involved in the Poisonous Demon Dragon case. I never imagined that &#8230;.it would have such a big impact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But monsters are like natural disasters, aren&#8217;t they? Is the Kingdom really supposed to be held responsible for that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are circumstances. &#8230;&#8230; You, too, know the alias of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew what Princess Rushia  meant by that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The land that bonded with dragons&#8230;.?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. The&#8230;&#8230;poison demon dragon is a monster that was born in this country, so it is understandable they are distrusted. And in fact, the Kingdom of Enuvidia sometimes carries out dragon protection activities. If they say that the Poisonous Demon Dragon is the only exception, they won&#8217;t be convinced.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, is the Kingdom of Enuvidia deliberately leaving the poisonous demon dragons unattended? It is suspected. It is not thought that they are protecting the dragon, but the kingdom may be judged reluctant to defeat it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poisonous demon dragons are rampant in all countries, though not as rampant as in the Intail Kingdom. It is only natural that the countries that have suffered&#8230;.. should take the brunt of the anger. In this case, the Kingdom of Enuvidia is truly under siege from all sides.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia continued that there are no other countries that are on her side. They say they are to take the brunt of the anger, but strictly speaking, the other countries are probably thinking to the extent that [if the Kingdom of Enuvidia pays reparations, they will be the beneficiaries]. This is an extremely unreasonable claim, but because it is the majority opinion, it is a situation that cannot be easily brushed off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Certainly Kingdom of Enuvidia in a tight corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, here&#8217;s the important thing&#8230;.. the Kingdom of Intail has been demanding reparations from our country for some time now. But the other day, their king reversed his opinion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reversed&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her back, Princess Rushia nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“According to father, the king of the kingdom of Intail said&#8230;&#8230;[A few moments ago, a highly skilled adventurer called Net went to the Kingdom of Aenebidia. Ask him to defeat the poisonous demon dragon. If he succeeds, the matter of compensation will be withdrawn].”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..he named me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia nodded her head and continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Enuvidia can&#8217;t defeat it, they&#8217;re going to go ahead in earnest with the compensation case, which has been postponed until now&#8230;&#8230;. At the very least, they won&#8217;t be convinced if I don&#8217;t send Ned into the fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.What the hell”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I realise that I&#8217;m not the only one to be put on such blatant conditions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That idiot king&#8230;&#8230; has been after me from the start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that they are making a compromise is also disgusting. In short, they are saying that if they let me join the fight, they will leave room for negotiation. From the perspective of the Kingdom of Enuvidia, if they said such a thing, it is obvious that they would bite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know it&#8217;s a dubious proposition. But&#8230;..father seems to have accepted this proposal. It is a no-lose proposition for our country. &#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I can defeat the Poisonous Demon Dragon, it will be profitable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I fail and I die, relations between the two countries can be maintained as before for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The compensation offered is so huge that it is impossible not to accept, considering the position our country is in. I am sorry&#8230;&#8230;.I am really, really sorry. I have succumbed to pressure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it is rejected, the Kingdom of Enuvidia will be perceived as having no intention of accepting any blame for the Poisonous Demon Dragon. This could lead to a diplomatic issue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, let me clear up one misunderstanding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May says in a clear voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her Highness was dismissive of the matter from the outset. While we were fulfilling the Guild&#8217;s request, Her Highness tried desperately to persuade her father. But still His Majesty did not understand, so Her Highness had no choice but to try to detain you with her own hands before His Majesty did&#8230;..because if we restrain you, it will only be for show. But if His Majesty moves, it will be rough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I didn&#8217;t realise that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No wonder it was a hasty move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia was in a hurry to protect me. She must have felt she had to take me into her own hands before the king could make his move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia  couldn&#8217;t explain what happened, probably because His Majesty the Idiot of the Kingdom of Intail had asked to keep quiet about the matter. Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter what they explained to me anyway. I&#8217;m not stupid enough to say [I understand] when someone says [I won&#8217;t do anything wrong, just let me restrain you] and I&#8217;m not stupid enough to hold out my hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia, I&#8217;m sorry I hit you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s okay. It was me, s who was at fault&#8230;.., but it hurt so much. I thought I was going to die&#8230;&#8230;.Uuu.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t remember hitting her that hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just a light chop. It was almost the same force as when I knocked on the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not Princess Rushia&#8217;s fault&#8230;&#8230;or rather, this case also involves my circumstances.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. your circumstances?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia tilted her head at me as I said with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The reason I left the Kingdom of Intil was because I had a disagreement with His Majesty in that country. As a matter of fact…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell Princess Rushia and May about the connection between me and His Majesty the Idiot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I finished telling them everything, they looked at me with their eyes wide open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve been expelled from the hero party&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa. As a result, the current hero party is often run amok&#8230;&#8230;and perhaps that&#8217;s what made them target me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I feel like I&#8217;m the one who started this whole thing. It&#8217;s my fault for getting you two involved. I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, maybe it wouldn&#8217;t have happened if I hadn&#8217;t come to the Kingdom of Enuvidia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned is not to blame. That king is quite a dark lord, if you ask me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu&#8230;&#8230;May is right, it is their king who is unreasonable&#8230;&#8230;And originally, the matter of the Poisonous Demon Dragon has been struggling behind the scenes for a long time. It may have started because of Ned, but sooner or later these problems would eventually come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This may indeed be the case. In fact, the Kingdom of Intail is currently suffering massive damage from the heroic parties. It is possible that they are just trying to squeeze money out of the Kingdom of Enuvidia to recover from that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The bad guy&#8230; is the king of the Kingdom of Intail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If only that idiotic king could be dealt with, this matter would be settled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The policy is set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I’m gonna deal with poison demon dragons, I know some people, there&#8217;s still a way to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a deadline for the slaying of the poisonous dragon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; by the end of the week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Again, absurd.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That idiot Majesty, he really is too blatant. The Poisonous Demon Dragon is such a threat that even if I formed a coalition force, I would have retreated. There is no way I can prepare a decent force in a week. In short, he&#8217;s probably telling me to die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Will I manage to get it sorted out this week?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a way, this is a good opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I’m thinking about the future, it&#8217;s better to cut ties with His Majesty the Idiot as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia, I want you to let me stay at the royal castle tonight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For appearances&#8217; sake, it&#8217;s better to be restrained, isn&#8217;t it? I want to calm down and think things over, so I&#8217;ll just accept it for now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Princess Rushia smiled unreliably and looked at May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, restrain Ned&#8230;&#8230; lock him up in a nice room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room I was taken to in the name of restraint was a luxurious guest room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was probably a room reserved for a nobleman. The room is spacious, the furnishings are all of high quality and there is even a separate room for the squires to relax and unwind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a quick look at the interior of the room, I stepped out onto the balcony and a cool breeze lifted my fringes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just right for cooling my head. Let&#8217;s do some thinking here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; First, I need to find out what that asshole His Majesty is after.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Majesty&#8217;s purpose is to clash me with the Poisonous Demon Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What could be the reason for this?&#8230;&#8230;There are two candidates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first is to spite me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know from the newspapers that the heroes&#8217; party is going out of control. If they just want to make me feel bad about it, they may be able to get away with it by simply passing on the information to His Majesty that they are suffering because of me. If it&#8217;s really just a case of spite, then they probably aren&#8217;t that serious about compensation either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Secondly, they are seriously trying to kill me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They don&#8217;t have any reason to hold a grudge against me, Unless,they think killing me is going to stop the hero party from running amok? If that&#8217;s the case, even if I defeat the Poison Demon Dragon, they could send further assassination after me. If I don&#8217;t take some action to break His Majesty&#8217;s thinking, I&#8217;ll be a target for a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;This is becoming a hassle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brushed his hair back lightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why not just prepare shadow warriors and have them fight the poisonous demon dragon and fake my death? &#8230;.. not very realistic. If the disguise is discovered, the position of the Kingdom of Enuvidia will become even worse, and in the first place, disguising death is not something that can be continued for a long time. In the future, when I come into contact with a celebrity like Riese, I will inevitably stand out. It would be impossible to keep the information that I am alive secret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, there is no doubt what triggered&#8230;.was the outburst of the heroic party. If so, would His Majesty the Idiot withdraw his proposal if I stopped their outburst?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As much as it pains me to say it&#8230;..should I ask the hero party to hold their own for a moment?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a communication stone, I try to contact the heroes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But no matter how long I waited, the communication did not connect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it, they must have taken the&#8230;..communication stone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Majesty the Idiot. Do you realise that you are strangling yourself?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the exception of Julius, every member of the heroic party had a communication stone with my contact details registered on it. But they probably took it away. Thanks to this, I am now unable to contact each of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. Let&#8217;s put this one on hold, shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The deadline is this week. I have to get some kind of result by then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, apart from the Poisonous Demon Dragon matter, there was one other thing that was on my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The frozen heart of Princess Rushia&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These were the words uttered by the head maid, Hersha.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her what she meant, she replied that I should ask Princess Rushia herself or May&#8230;&#8230; Does these two have some kind of secret thing going on?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ ─ Princess Rushia&#8217;s attitude was a little strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember, just after I entered her room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia, who had been appealing against violence, had her hand on her chest, but &#8230;&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t help but notice the way she was moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not so much that she was afraid of me approaching her, but&#8230;&#8230;it was a movement as if she was desperately trying to restrain herself from putting out her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a little different from the behaviour of a frightened person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was acting as if she was more afraid of herself &#8211; who didn&#8217;t know what she was going to do &#8211; than of me, who was right in front of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; no good. It&#8217;s incomprehensible speculation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t even know if this has anything to do with the Poisonous Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a light headache from overthinking. Fatigue has reached its limit. Thinking about it, today is quite a hard schedule, fighting monsters and being chased by the castle knights. It&#8217;s a tough day for me, who has an existence power of 1, let alone Riese, who has an existence power of 6.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I realise that the soles of my feet felt uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked and saw that there was something strange stuck in the sole of my shoe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this? A white &#8230;&#8230; gem?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the object in my hand, shone it in the moonlight and observed it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pure white stone was light, flat and looked like a piece of something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was doing the guild&#8217;s requests and walking around the castle with Hersha, I didn&#8217;t feel any discomfort in the soles of my feet. If that is the case, this was caught in the sole of my shoe afterwards&#8230;. after I entered Princess Rushia&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this from Princess Rushia&#8217;s room?　But where have I seen it before&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It gets caught strangely. It just didn&#8217;t seem like a jewel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s check it out, shall we?&#8230;&#8230;So I put the white stone in my pouch and went back to the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was changing from my nightgown in the closet into my going-out clothes, there was a knock on the door and a blue-haired girl walked in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, wearing her armour as usual, looks at me with a complicated expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; you didn&#8217;t run away, did you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a small voice, May said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had apparently anticipated that I might flee the castle last night. I&#8217;d be lying if I said I hadn&#8217;t thought about that, but it would only jeopardise the position of Princess Rushia and the others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meir and Princess Rushia told me that it wasn&#8217;t my fault for what happened,&#8230;..but even so, it was definitely me who triggered it. I&#8217;m not going to run away until I take responsibility for that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;&#8230;.I knew you would say that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You trust me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I know you well enough from our association over the last few days to know that you are a righteous man.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May says with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Ned. If you&#8217;re getting dressed, does that mean you&#8217;re going out now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. I&#8217;m going to make a quick stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll accompany you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May smiles apologetically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Surveillance&#8230;..just in case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, I&#8217;m convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s concern can be seen in the fact that she has chosen May to act as her watchdog.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May, can I have breakfast first?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure. To tell you the truth, I haven&#8217;t eaten yet either, so this is good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the castle we go into a suitable restaurant and order a light meal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Ned. What are you going to do about the poison demon dragon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it before opening my mouth to May, who asked me with a mysterious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m still struggling to think. Defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon is difficult, but&#8230;&#8230;this case is ultimately caused by the king of the Intail Kingdom, isn&#8217;t it?　Then I might be able to do something if I seize that king&#8217;s weakness and negotiate with him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;You think you can even hold the weakness of the king of a country?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I wanted to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May looks surprised and disbelieving at what I’ve said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I just don&#8217;t want to use my contacts in that way if I can help it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because it&#8217;s dangerous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Communicate clearly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My contacts can turn into a devil&#8217;s weapon if they&#8217;re used the wrong way. Such..threat could be the first step.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surely, if I wanted to, I could take on the weakness of any person, old or young.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From village girl to the king of a country, and even the S-class adventurers with existence power 7, of which there are only ten in the world, I am sure that I can blackmail countless people. I&#8217;m proud to say that I have that much information network.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I have never wanted that kind of power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above all, I don&#8217;t want my friends, who are important to me and on whom I rely, to be part of such force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I use my contacts for dirty things, I&#8217;ll also be defiling the way of life of the people who help me. That doesn&#8217;t make me feel very good. I don&#8217;t want to act in a way that will harm my friends. That&#8217;s why I try to avoid blackmail, fraud, and injustice&#8230;..as much as possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at May after explaining that much, she had a serious expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may have spoken too seriously. To soften the air that had somehow become tense, I gave her a small smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, when I say avoid, I mean to the extent of not taking the easy way out&#8230;&#8230;.they say that a life is a kind of thing, and maybe this is a time when I need that kind of power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tipped the cup on the table with my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I quenches my throat with sweet tea, May, sitting opposite me, smiles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m starting to get to know you, somehow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staring me in the face, May said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not just about being righteous. Deep down&#8230;&#8230; you respect someone who is willing to help you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Somehow..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They can all do things I could never do. They are walking a way of life that I could not walk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t want to just twist their way of life. I want to keep admiring them forever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s get back to the story.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, putting my cup on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m in a situation where I&#8217;m having a lot of trouble defeating the poisonous demon dragon, as I&#8217;ve just explained. I&#8217;d like to ask you, just for..reference, what do you want me to do, May?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I know it’s a bit pushing, but the ideal is still to defeat them. At any rate, the poisonous demon dragons are nothing but a blight on our country.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staring at the cup in her hand, May says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, there is no queen in this country. Do you know why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head at the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The queen was killed in an attack by a poisonous dragon when she left the capital for a festive event. It was right in front of the young Princess Rushia&#8217;s eyes. Since then, she has hated fighting&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;She had such a past?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.   If we put aside diplomatic gains and losses and the pressure of our position,&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m sure she is genuinely waiting for someone to avenge her mother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Princess Rushia, the Poison Demon Dragon is also the killer of her mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;.you can do something about it, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May asked with a clinging look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reply, thinking of a few people I know in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As far as I know, there are six people who could defeat the&#8230;..Poison Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hou, really?　Then, if you ask those people to help..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But just because they can defeat it doesn&#8217;t mean they will.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said to May, who was in a hurry to come to a conclusion, in a slightly more forceful tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All six of them are far away and their positions are complicated&#8230;&#8230;.Wwe should expect to wait a few years, not this week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. years, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May bites her lip at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese could not win even if she took on the challenge together with her friends from the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』. If I want to defeat such an opponent, I need an existence force of seven. In other words, I need a hero, one of no more than ten in the world&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have the candidate, but I am not ready to prepare for it right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is precisely one person who is close by, but due to bad timing, I can&#8217;t get in touch with him at the moment. If I don&#8217;t stick to the deadline of&#8230;&#8230;this week, it&#8217;s not impossible to take it down. I could give him a shout when this is over..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeating the poisonous demon dragon is an extremely difficult problem, but it is not impossible if I take my time. I told her so, but&#8230;..May&#8217;s expression remained downcast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she looks, I have my doubts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m only introducing the people to you, but you could be a bit more pleased. Even though it&#8217;s going to take a few years, you&#8217;re going to be able to slay a poisonous demon dragon that&#8217;s been on the loose for a while now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Yes, it is. It&#8217;s certainly a delight. I&#8217;m thrilled.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a forced, made-up smile, May said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;a few years? I hope I can keep it until then. &#8230;.. Haha, if only I&#8217;d met you long before this,&#8230;.. or maybe that&#8217;s a wish I don&#8217;t have&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a self-mocking smile, May mumbled something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Keep it&#8230;..? What does she mean?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Sorry. My head was a bit confused.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May apologises briefly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After regaining her composure, May looks at me with a calm face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned is right, it would be very gratifying to be able to defeat the poisonous demon dragons, even if it takes a long time&#8230;&#8230;But doesn’t that solve the problems that are happening now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May is right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It might be better to separate the matter of the Poisonous Demon Dragon from the matter of His Majesty the Idiot. I am now facing the latter problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I&#8217;m putting my head together like this, I can&#8217;t help but remember something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the words that Hersha had uttered last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May. I&#8217;m going to change the subject, but&#8230;&#8230;is Princess Rushia  hiding anything from me?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; hiding things?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just a curiosity, I’m not forcing you to answer, but I thought &#8230;&#8230; you might know something about Princess Rushia. Do you know anything?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m also concerned about May&#8217;s current behaviour and Princess Rushia&#8217;s attitude last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe there’s some important secrets about this case that I don&#8217;t know about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May says, looking straight at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sounded as confident as she always does but I knew she was lying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She probably thought she couldn&#8217;t look away from me. That&#8217;s why she decided to look straight into my eyes, but that&#8217;s not natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, May&#8217;s mouth is tight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I have to find it by myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s time we left the restaurant&#8230;&#8230;Is there an Appraisers&#8217; Guild in this town?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ask, straightening my back lightly after eating my breakfast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then, show me the way. I have something I&#8217;d like to appraise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, remembering the white gemstone in my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a profession known as appraisers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their job is to analyse the details and value of any item. Due to the nature of their work, they often have a vast amount of knowledge and many of them are scholars.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are organised by an organisation called the Appraisers Guild.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Guild of Appraisers and the Adventurers Guild have a close relationship. When adventurers bring back items from their adventures, they often find strange plants and minerals mixed in. In such cases, it is the turn of the appraisers&#8217; guild to mediate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In towns where adventurers are active, appraisers are also active.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Appraisers Guild in the royal capital of Enuvidia was a large, clean building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the Guild of Appraisers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, the guide says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, what are you appraising?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know what it is, so I&#8217;m having it appraised.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu, sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I would try to mislead her, but somehow May is convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We entered the building and headed for the reception desk. A young young man noticed us and responded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome. Are you requesting an appraisal?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I need an appraisal of some minerals&#8230;&#8230;and a some kind of jewellery.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, we can&#8217;t do an appraisal on any minerals. We are busy at the moment and the waiting time will be half a day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Appraisals takes time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was willing to wait an hour or two, but&#8230;..half a day is a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I recall, the Guild of Appraisers also works with guilds in other countries, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Unlike adventurers, appraisers are small in number. We have to share information frequently to get by, so we work well together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then use this..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a card out of my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should be registered as a priority guide. Now you can give me an early result.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I understand. Please wait a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young man at reception looked slightly startled but quickly got down to business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young man takes the card and goes to work in the back room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned&#8230;&#8230;What was that about?　You said you were a priority guide&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s sort of a perk of being a preferred guide. You get it for requesting an appraisal of a thousand items or more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s sort of a perk for being a good customer. You get it for requesting over a thousand appraisals.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-a thousand items? Isn’t that a lot of stuff to appraise?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you&#8217;re adventuring in uncharted territory, everything you see is an unknown object and if you&#8217;re working with frontline adventurers, you&#8217;re going to get over a thousand points pretty quickly”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-mazing, being an adventurer&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May gave a drawn-out smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to keep you waiting. You must be Ned-sama, our priority guide.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist returns to the counter after the confirmation process.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;,just to confirm, there are a total of seven of these cards issued, and they are shared in the same name by more than one person, correct?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa,as it should be.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Recently, several items were appraised in the Republic of Luxent in the name of Ned-sama. Also, last month,was the Valreid Empire and the Holy Place Kingdom. Three months ago, it was the Kakusen Empire and the Ingrid Empire&#8230;&#8230;.it seems that Ned-sama’s name is being used all over the world&#8230;&#8230; Do you have any idea what&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Aaa”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, he is concerned that my name is being misused by a stranger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I have a vague idea, so I’m confident it is not being misused.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They&#8217;re&#8230;&#8230; still using my name.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have told them to re-register it in their own name if they felt like it, but apparently none of them felt like doing it. They&#8217;re still as lax as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The card certifying the priority guide has no deposit or withdrawal functions. Therefore, there were no separate security issues.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, we will be with you shortly, but if you use the Guild&#8217;s services as a&#8230;.. priority guide, you will not be able to bring a companion with you. Please be patient.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young man at the reception desk looked at May and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May wait here, please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May nodded quickly. She doesn&#8217;t seem to think I&#8217;m going to run anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The receptionist guides me to the appraiser.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each appraiser often had their own equipment, hence the large number of workrooms within the guild. We proceeded down an intricate corridor until we reached a square room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m Rezac, the appraiser. Let me see the goods first.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A bearded man in a chair holds out one hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the white stone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This white gemstone&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The texture, the shape, it&#8217;s unique&#8230;&#8230; Well, since it is brought to us by a priority guide, one of only ten in the world. Let&#8217;s check it out a bit more carefully.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explained to May that if she works with first-class adventurers, she can easily become a priority guide, but there aren&#8217;t many first-class adventurers to begin with, so less than ten is an acceptable number. Incidentally, my card is divided into seven cards, but since it is in my name alone, I am treated as one person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?&#8230;&#8230; Oi,oi customer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rezac, who was appraising the stones with a loupe, speaks up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This guy ain&#8217;t no stone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. not a stone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then what is that white object?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a scale.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head and Rezac explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve never seen this kind before, but I&#8217;m sure of it. These are the scales of a dragon&#8230;&#8230;Sometimes people mistake dragon scales for gemstones. They both look alike.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I heard that description, it outlined the discomfort I had in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a long time, I thought the stone looked familiar. Now that I know that they are dragon scales,&#8230;&#8230;I can clearly remember where I have seen them in the past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want to do now?　I&#8217;m a mineral appraiser, so if you want to know more about this guy, I can refer you to another appraiser&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; No, thanks. I&#8217;ve got what I need to know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take the scales from Rezac&#8217;s hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, you&#8217;ve been a great help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I turned on my heel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I leave the guild with haste.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After leaving the Guild of Appraisers, I headed for the Royal Castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May, who was waiting near the entrance, was surprised to see me walking without looking back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,wait, wait! Ned! Where are you going?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back to the castle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her briefly, stopped once and showed May what was in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“May. Is this what you were hiding?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May&#8217;s eyes widened when she saw the white gem or rather, the dragon scales in my palm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She clearly knew what this was, and reacted accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moreover, I&#8217;m a grade A adventurer. I think I know some about these scales&#8230;..I&#8217;ll ask her for an explanation. May, is that okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May nodded as if in contemplation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of us went straight back to the castle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our destination is the place I snuck into last night &#8211; Princess Rushia&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, guests are not allowed to enter this area, but I  was not stopped by the knights as I was escorted by May. After climbing the stairs and proceeding down the corridor for a while, we eventually see a door at the end of the corridor that leads to Princess Rushia&#8217;s room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is where you stop, May.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I stop and I say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d like a moment alone with Rushia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">May nodded her head with a mysterious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked down the corridor alone, approaching Princess Rushia&#8217;s room</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last night, I did not notice when I was being shown around by Hersha, but there were no knights standing by near Princess Rushia&#8217;s room. For security reasons, they should have a few knights stationed around the front of the room, but there are reasons why this is not possible for&#8230;..Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to touch the door, when.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl&#8217;s voice was heard from the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu….aa! Kuu..nn..Haa!..NnaaA!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear Rushia&#8217;s charming voice, the same as last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I listen carefully, I can hear it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is&#8230; the sound of suffering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing it was rude, I opened the door without knocking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Rushia, who was sitting on the bed, looked back at me with great energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ne, Ned&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia was astonished when she saw me appear suddenly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, I calmly observe her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has long silver hair damp with sweat and flushed cheeks. Her dishevelled clothes and soggy bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are all scenes I saw last night, but there are two things that are different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One is that Princess Rushia has a bitter, agonised expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The other is the large white wings growing out of Princess Rushia&#8217;s slender back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing here Ne—Gu…ahhhHH!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a crackling sound, Rushia&#8217;s wings enlarge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pure white scales were eroding the surface of herslender, small body. The hardened scales were like armour, and from the elbows of both arms it looked as if it was wearing sturdy cage hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, don&#8217;t &#8230;&#8230;! Don&#8217;t look at &#8230;&#8230;! Don&#8217;t look!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rushia&#8217;s pupils split vertically. It was as if she were a reptile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, a weighty pressure that did not seem to belong to a human being was released. The glass in the room cracked all at once and I felt as if my heart had been grabbed by an eagle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of helpless fear in the face of an absolute power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pressure, which I had not felt for a long time, caused me to break out in a cold sweat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to the confused Rushia  as calmly as I could.</span></p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/p184-720x1024.png"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am weak. I am not a person who would normally be able to bear this kind of pressure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I&#8217;ve done this many times before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order not to provoke Rushia, I slowly approach her and open the pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From inside, I take out a small bottle of medicine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s an elixir of all-purpose elixirs. It will temporarily suppress your symptoms.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a rare drug that can be used to treat any condition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is so expensive that it should not normally be owned by private individuals. Princess Rushia was clearly suspicious of it, but, realising that she pushed it away, she picked up the vial and fearfully sipped the liquid inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, Princess Rushia’s bloating body subsided.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The constant creaking of bones stopped and the white scales covering her body began to peel off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up one of the peeled off scales.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no doubt. What I had mistaken for a gem earlier was this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rushia&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unintentionally, I called out her name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Poisonous Demon Dragons harbour a deadly poison. Perhaps I should have anticipated the situation when I heard her explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These symptoms lead to&#8230;&#8230; dragonization disease.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Princess Rushia silently cast her eyes down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dragonification disease is literally a disease that causes people to turn into dragons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some monsters called dragons wear something like a poison called miasma. Prolonged exposure to such a miasma can lead to the onset of the dragonisation disease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Patients with dragonisation disease can normally spend time in a human body. However, from time to time, in the form of seizures, the body transforms into that of a dragon. When the seizures end, the body returns to that of a human, but as the disease progresses, the intervals between seizures become shorter and shorter, and eventually the patient is in a state of constant seizures &#8211; in other words, unable to return from the body of a dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;The poison demon dragon got to you, didn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Princess Rushia, who was sitting up in bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having taken the medicine, Princess Rushia had returned to a human body. Looking at her white, slender body, I almost thought that the scene I had just seen was a dream. However, the countless white scales scattered at her feet tells me the scene was real.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have heard the story from May. I heard that when Queen&#8230;&#8230;was killed by a poisonous demon dragon, Princess Rushia was also by her side. Is that when you contracted the dragonisation disease?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her silence means an affirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Why didn&#8217;t you tell me such an important thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell her, suppressing my emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The dragonisation disease will continue to progress unless the dragon that caused the disease is defeated. In other words&#8230;..if you don&#8217;t defeat the poisonous demon dragon, Princess Rushia will eventually quit being human.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At these words, Princess Rushia reacted with a small twitch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean&#8230;..by saying that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A trembling voice spun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Poisonous Demon Dragon is a genuine monster that could not be defeated even if a coalition army was organised. Even if&#8230;..I reveal that I’m suffering from dragonification disease,it does not mean that more force will be gathered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, it may be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Dragonisation Disease it&#8217;s not just a disease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Dragonisation disease is also known as the disease of heroes”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Princess Rushia knows about it. But I dared to explain it, to confront her with that fact once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The symptoms of the Dragons Disease can be said to be that a human being is imbued with the power of a dragon&#8230;&#8230;.So the dragonisation disease is a curse and a blessing at the same time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I know of several people who have listed dragon disease as a blessing on their guild&#8217;s registration form.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The power of the dragon can be a tremendous asset if a person knows how to use it. So much so that they can even slay dragons that have become the pathogens. &#8230;.. So patients with dragon sickness often go on to use the dragon power in their bodies to slay the dragon that has become pathogenic by themselves&#8230;..This is the common cure for dragonisation disease, and hence it is also called the disease of heroes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell Princess Rushia, who looks down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Princess Rushia should be no exception. If you can master the power of that dragon, you might be able to defeat&#8230;.the Poisonous Demon Dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beforeher body turns into a full dragon, she must use her power and go to defeat the dragon that is causing the disease. That is the general treatment for dragonisation disease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed, you are right, the dragon disease is also known as the disease of heroes. There are many fairy tales in the world about the mortal struggle between the human who has the power of the dragon and the dragon who gave him that power&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says with an unreliable smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The problem is that &#8230;&#8230;I cannot be the hero of such fairy tales.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean&#8230;..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m afraid.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Short but clear voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you&#8230;.I hate fighting. I am a coward who won&#8217;t even touch a weapon&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This statement reminded me of a story I heard from May.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s mother was killed by a poisonous demon dragon in front of her eyes. She is probably traumatised by that memory. However…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Certainly, for Princess Rushia, fighting may be something that brings back bad memories. But this is no longer the time to be thinking about such things..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──I&#8217;ve tried it before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia interrupts me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even I was not this weak-kneed from the start. In the past, I also tried to use the power of this dragon to avenge my mother&#8217;s death. &#8230;&#8230; but as a result of using this dragon&#8217;s power..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia squeezes the sheet in her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;hell was born right in front of me. It was like a scene after the rampage of a poisonous demon dragon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia, whose mother was killed by a poisonous demon dragon, naturally remembers the view vividly. And when she herself unleashed the dragon&#8217;s power, the exact same view was created before her eyes&#8230;&#8230;. What emotions were swirling in Princess Rushia&#8217;s heart at that time? It is not difficult to&#8230;&#8230; imagine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want to use &#8230;..that kind of power. With that, instead of defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon, &#8230;&#8230; I would also become a Poisonous Demon Dragon. That &#8230;&#8230; is also the most terrifying thing for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says in a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I remember the terrified eyes of all the&#8230;&#8230;people when Mother was killed by the Poison Demon Dragon. I don&#8217;t want&#8230;&#8230;to look like that,&#8230;.I’m not a poison demon dragon&#8230;&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia says, spilling tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered this room, Princess Rushia&#8217;s cry of [Don&#8217;t look!] reminds me of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re hiding the Dragonisation Disease?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Yes. Only May knows about the dragonisation disease.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia&#8217;s concealment about this matter was greater than I had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the symptoms of dragon sickness are difficult to keep a secret. The head maid, Hersha, must have found out about this by accident. And then she tried to confide this information to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear that the timing of the seizure is uncontrollable. And I&#8217;ve also heard that if you try to hold it in, you&#8217;ll be in tremendous&#8230;..pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why there are no knights guarding Princess Rushia&#8217;s room. This is because in the event of a seizure, the knights might hear the anguish leaking from the room and rush to the scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I think about it, that&#8217;s probably why the security in the&#8230;.big bathroom was so thin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How often do you dragonise?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Every three days at the most. The shortest is&#8230;..one day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How have you managed to keep it under wraps at such short intervals?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have confidence in my endurance. I&#8217;ve been holding back during the day, and then late at night or early in the morning, I&#8217;d dragonise in the castle gardens.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The explanation reminded me of a huge shadow I had seen in the morning mist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the shadow I witnessed during my walk in the castle gardens was the&#8230;&#8230;dragonised Princess Rushia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve already &#8230;&#8230; progressed quite a bit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The intervals between seizures have become short.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, Princess Rushia&#8217;s dragonisation disease must have progressed considerably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─three months if she keeps this up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s a rough estimate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Worst case scenario, &#8230;&#8230; it won&#8217;t last a month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why didn&#8217;t you tell me that&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked, running my hand over my forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t you even think to tell me about your&#8230;&#8230; dragonisation disease when you first tried to restrain me?　Princess Rushia would have had the option of appealing to compassion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I have already answered that question. It doesn&#8217;t matter what I say, and &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to see people get hurt because of me”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia lowered her gaze and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to overdo it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Princess Rushia picked up a small stone on the desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned, do you know what this is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The &#8230;&#8230; communication stone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I&#8217;ve had this and the stone in communication with May all day today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that they are communicating means that&#8230;my conversation was overheard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Princess Rushia had been eavesdropping on the conversation between me and Meir.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have already heard your conversation&#8230;.. defeating the Poisonous Demon Dragon will be tough, won&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia barely formed a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You intend to settle this matter by blackmailing the Kingdom of Intail, don&#8217;t you? &#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s all right. There is no need to think about anything more than that”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; but then what about Princess Rushia&#8217;s dragonisation disease?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to take it that far&#8230;&#8230;Originally, the poisonous demon dragons is the problem of the Kingdom of Enuvidia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my head to Princess Rushia, who smiled fleetingly at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not going to be so heartless as to nod so easily here. Princess Rushia has three months at the most. If I start acting now, I won&#8217;t make it in time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to keep it a secret because of this &#8230;&#8230; atmosphere.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia tells me with a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a cheerful tone of voice, but it was definitely emphatic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It may be difficult to prepare a new force now. But if &#8230;&#8230;Princess Rushia fights with me, we might have a chance of winning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. I will not fight. It is enough if I can live out the rest of my life as a human being to the end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia tells me with a dejected look on her face, as if her tears have run dry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m going to finish this by myself before I turn into a full-blown dragon. If I use&#8230;..such monstrous power, I will be so hated by the people&#8230;&#8230; that I won&#8217;t be able to live.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if it was her destiny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia told her in a tone of realisation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sky was tinged with sunset when I realised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was alone in the guest room of the royal castle, silently thinking, when I saw the orange-green sunlight illuminating the roofs of the castle town and finally realised the progress of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that several hours have passed since the discovery of Princess Rushia&#8217;s dragonisation disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I let out an involuntary sigh, a figure suddenly appeared on the balcony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There she was, Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat surprised by her sudden appearance, I open the balcony door and invite Lese into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;. where did you come from?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could have come in from the front, but I thought it would be quicker this way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese then took a communication stone from inside his armour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll give it back to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Aaa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the communication stone that was thrown to me and put it in my pouch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Princess Rushia seemed to have been eavesdropping on our conversation by giving May a communication stone But, Riese and I were doing the same thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last night, before we stormed into the castle, I put a communication stone in Riese&#8217;s hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had arranged for her to be in constant communication with me while I was at the castle, so that if I was in danger, she would come to me immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, I was not in danger, but Riese, who had eavesdropped on the&#8230;&#8230;conversation, must have known.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Princess Rushia&#8217;s body was being consumed by the dragonisation disease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8230;This composition looks like I&#8217;ve come to crawl in the night. It&#8217;s still evening.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re a carefree woman, Oi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s better than both of us not being able to be together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese is right, I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She can see that I&#8217;m not in a good state of mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you going to do? Are you going to go ahead and blackmail the king of the Kingdom of Intil as planned and call it a day?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese asked in an indifferent tone of voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not accusing her of anything, nor am I urging her to do anything. I am sure that whatever answer I give here, Riese will nod and respect it, saying, [I see].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is why I’m having a hard time talking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that any decision I make is respected means that I have to decide, all by myself, what is right and what is wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa—shit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I no longer had the energy to put on a façade of composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brushed my hair back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really, why do I always, always &#8230;&#8230; always have to go through this? This&#8230;.is the role of stronger guys like you &#8230;. “</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I think about on a daily basis just spills out of my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just an ordinary guy&#8230;&#8230;and all these guys, they&#8217;re the ones that got all this messy stuff&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess that&#8217;s your destiny.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so noisy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my heart, anger and feelings of helplessness are mixed up in my veins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.Well, the interests are aligned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the outset, threats are a means of creating havoc.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides not wanting to use my friends to do dirty things, it&#8217;s a method I want to avoid as much as possible. As I was trying to convince myself by such reasoning, Riese gave me a warm look, as if she were watching over a child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like that about you, you know. You&#8217;re a man who can stand up for someone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be ridiculous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not joking. That&#8217;s the best thing about you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese  looks me straight in the eye and tells me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn&#8217;t set out to be a hero, did you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Don&#8217;t say that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a past I didn&#8217;t want to poke too much into, so I looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me like this, Riese smiles gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what do we do?　I somehow know what you&#8217;re thinking, but perhaps the key is Her Highness Rushia? You can take the&#8230;&#8230;horses to the water, but you can&#8217;t get them to drink water.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know what Riese means.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is up to the owner to take the horse to the water, but it is up to the horse to decide whether or not to drink water there. Even if&#8230;&#8230; they are forced to take them somewhere, what they do there can only be left to them. However—</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately &#8230;.. my job is always to get that horse to drink water.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; I suppose you could say that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, one horse is definitely not enough of a force&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s leave the role of filling that strength to the adventurers in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Riese. I need you to lend me the 『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..it&#8217;s a request from none other than you. I have no reason to refuse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese immediately shook his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, for some reason, she looked behind her&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, guys?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese asks, looking towards the balcony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, a large number of armoured women appeared, kneeling on one knee, waiting. They all look familiar. They are members of the &#8230;..『White Dragon Chivalric Order』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.. you brought them with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;I knew this was going to happen&#8230;..I really would have liked to rush in during the day, but it took a little longer to convene”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I mean, this is&#8230;&#8230;the Royal Castle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we&#8217;re not careful,we would all be caught trespassing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello,Ned-san, long time no see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re still the same troublemaker, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The members were as fluent as Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the looks of it, they apparently have a firm understanding of what I&#8217;m about to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sigh and went out onto the balcony with Riese.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The women in armour were crammed tightly together. I thought they must be very annoyed, having been forced to visit such a place at the whim of their leader but&#8230; For some reason, their expressions look somewhat proud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Please. Everyone, I need your help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed my head to the famous adventurers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Riese , their leader, knelt down in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Twelve members of the『White Dragon Chivalric Order』will now swing their swords for you.”</span></p>
