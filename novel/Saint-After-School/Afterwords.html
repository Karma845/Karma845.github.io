<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while. If you&#8217;re new here, it&#8217;s nice to meet you. I&#8217;m Tozuka Riku.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for picking up the third volume of &#8220;I Know That After School, The Saint Is More Than Noble.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was thanks to all of you who support us that we were able to publish the third volume in this way.</p>

<p>This volume finally marked the start of the summer vacation, and unlike the previous volumes, I think I was able to show you Yamato and Seira enjoying their long vacation instead of school life.</p>
<p>With the introduction of a new character, Tsubaki, Yamato learns more about Seira&#8217;s past and contemplates their relationship.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue to watch as the two slowly come to terms with each other.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many exciting and thrilling events typical of summer vacation, so we hope you will enjoy them.</p>
<p>The illustrations in this issue are also a highlight, and the cute and fresh appearance of Seira and Tsubaki is a must-see. Also, I personally think Seira eating ramen on the cover is just too cute, so please check it out!</p>

<p>Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the editor in charge and to everyone involved in the publication of this work. I look forward to working with you in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks to Takubon-sama for the illustrations. Thank you again for your precious and summery illustrations. I look forward to working with you in the future.</p>
<p>And to our readers, thank you very much for reading the third volume. I will try my best to make you enjoy it even more in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for reading this far.</p>

<p>Hope to see you again in the next volume.</p>

<p>[TLN: Vol 4 released, and also thanks for reading. I know there are parts that sound rough here and there, but I hope it all made sense after reading them. Also, go thank Anima for all his help on the edits.]</p>
<p>[EDN: Hey, sorry for the many delays for this volume. The fault lies mainly with me as the actual chapters were translated a long time ago but I got caught up with both procrastination and college work. The next volume is out already so I hope we will be able to push it out faster. Anyways thanks for reading and thanks to Char for tling!]</p>
