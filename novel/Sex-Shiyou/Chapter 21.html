<h3>Chapter 21 &#8211; People Who Understand Each Other</h3>

<p>「Y-You cheater!?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>While being surprised, Kurumi-san came to us and pulled me off Ogura. Then, she clung to my left arm like a koala. How cute.</p>
<p>Her pouty cheeks reveal the extent of her anger. Cute.</p>
<p>Certainly, since she didn’t see how Ogura stumbled, she would misunderstand. Cute.</p>
<p>….No, Kurumi-san’s cuteness has caused an abnormality in my language center. <em>Emergency emergency</em>. Is there any doctor who knows how to stop being emotionally high?</p>
<p>「Mhuaahhh」</p>
<p>I peck her plump cheek.</p>
<p>「……!?」</p>
<p>I thought she was surprised but she was glaring at me sharply. Even when glaring, she’s so cute. What a sinful beauty.</p>
<p>「I’m not cheating.」</p>
<p>「Y-you were hugging each other!」</p>
<p>「I only supported her because she stumbled. I apologize if you misunderstood.」</p>
<p>I apologize before things get weird. According to a certain male anime character, it is better to apologize for taking suspicious actions regardless of whether you are having an affair. I’m not an anime character though.</p>
<p>「…..really?」</p>
<p>「Do you think I’m lying?」</p>
<p>「…I don’t want to think you do but…」</p>
<p>「I’ll only love Kurumi-san forever and ever.」</p>
<p>「～～」</p>
<p>「You look embarrassed! You’re so cute! Don’t you think so, Ogura?」</p>
<p>「Wha-, yo, what are you saying&#8212;」</p>
<p>「I agree.」</p>
<p>「What are you two talking about!?」</p>

<p>Ogura agreed nonchalantly and Kurumi-san seemed unable to hide her surprise. However, in the next instant, she huffed and hid herself behind me as if using my body as a shield. She’s only peeking a little at Ogura.</p>
<p>「….I’ve warned everyone in the class about you.」</p>
<p>I’m somewhat amused by the sudden change of subject but I think that’s her main purpose of coming here.</p>
<p>Without saying anything else, I shifted my gaze from Kurumi-san to Ogura. She looked at me as if she didn’t know what to say or how to respond and then, turned her head down while playing with her fingers and acting fidgety&#8212;</p>
<p>「T-thank you.」</p>
<p>She muttered that.</p>
<p>「….you don’t have to. I didn’t come here to hear you say that…or rather, don’t get me wrong. I haven’t forgiven you, Ogura-san.」</p>
<p>In contrast, Kurumi-san&#8217;s words are frosty.</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「Being bullied, poured by water….I can’t forgive you.」</p>
<p>That should be her true feelings.</p>
<p>No matter how much Ogura wants to make up with Kurumi-san, it will never be an easy task. The relationship between the two of them is that of a perpetrator and a victim. The contrasting relationship is irresistibly clear.</p>
<p>Should I interject or something like a 3<sup>rd</sup> party?</p>
<p>I thought for a moment&#8212;but when I saw the look on Kurumi-san’s face, I kept my mouth shut.</p>
<p>「&#8212;even so, I’m the only one who can sympathize with you.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「I know what Ogura-san is going through right now so….that’s why I helped you. That’s all. I really hated that though. Not having any allies, everyone’s against you, and no one’s reaching out to you…it was so painful so I don’t want anyone else to feel the same….」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>She tried to speak only the facts in a straightforward and unemotional manner. However, her voice began to sound wet….</p>
<p>「&#8212;Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>She had tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>I don’t know why. Is it because she’s getting too emotional unconsciously?</p>
<p>I love Kurumi-san and I know everything about her but I don’t know how she feels. And I also don’t understand how she feels….</p>
<p>To say that I understand her is simply blasphemy against her.</p>
<p>「That’s why I….I helped Ogura-san for myself. That’s why…don’t misunderstand that you were forgiven or anything similar….」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san sniffed and wiped her eyes with her cuff. That statement is very Kurumi-san-like.</p>
<p>「….yeah, I know, so……I also don’t think I’ll be forgiven………………bu-but, can you listen to what I’m going to say………please.」</p>
<p>Ogura’s voice was also trembling.</p>
<p>Her hands were shaking, her legs were trembling, and she was speaking with emotions.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath in to suppress the tremor of her voice&#8212;</p>
<p>「For bullying you all these times&#8212;I’m really sorry.」</p>
<p>She bowed to Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>Silence falls on the rooftop. From the floor below, I could hear the voices of the teachers conducting their lessons and from the ground, I could hear the hustle of PE classes.</p>
<p>It’s an ordinary day but not an ordinary day too.</p>
<p>The girl kept her head down in front of us. Her shoulder’s shaking and the degree of her tension is more apparent than what meets the eye.</p>
<p>After staring at her for a few seconds, Kurumi-san took a step or two closer to her.</p>

<p>As we grow older, it becomes less and less common for things to be resolved with an apology. The phrase, “If all you had to do was to say sorry, there wouldn’t be any need for the police” is a good example of this.</p>
<p>As we grow up, we usually have to take responsibility accordingly. For high school students like us, we are sometimes considered children and sometimes adults which is a very troublesome position to be in. However, in this case, I think it is right to act as an adult.</p>
<p>「S-sorry, I’m really sorry….」</p>
<p>「…..hnn, can you stop crying already?」</p>
<p>「Uuuuuhhhh, it-its-it’s because…….」</p>
<p>&#8212;the words “I’m sorry” can soften the girl named Koga Kurumi to some extent.</p>
<p>I don’t think I could do that.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I put some coins in the vending machine.</p>
<p>The location is still on the rooftop but inside the school building. I bought a can of coffee and two cans of cocoa from the vending machine on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor and returned to the two girls.</p>
<p>The girls are sitting on the stairs leading up to the 4<sup>th</sup> floor and Kurumi-san is patting Ogura’s head who’s still repeatedly saying she’s sorry. I’m kind of….jealous.</p>
<p>I’m the kind of guy who can’t tolerate a man who’ll get in between a yuri but when it’s someone I like, it’s a different story.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san, please pat my head too.」</p>
<p>「…..w-why?」</p>
<p>「Because I’m jealous.」</p>
<p>When I said my honest feeling, Kurumi-san pouted.</p>
<p>「Do you think it’s time to screw around?」</p>
<p>Ah, that’s harsh. However, she has a point, or at least a hundred points. I can only reluctantly back down while Ogura grabs her arm.</p>
<p>「I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…..Kurumi-chan……..」</p>
<p>「Yeah, I understand. Okay?」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>As Ogura cries and repeatedly apologizes, Kurumi-san shows her compassion like a holy mother. I fell in love with her all over again but….wait a minute….</p>
<p>「…….Kurumi-chan……….?」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>It seems that I was the only one who felt uncomfortable. Kurumi-san only nodded her head cutely after hearing what I said. I glared at the squinty-eyed Ogura but she’s not even looking at me. This opportunistic thieving cat….</p>
<p>（This girl….）</p>
<p>I sat down next to Kurumi-san while giving them two cocoa. I grabbed her arm and pulled her to me.</p>
<p>「W-what are you doing!?」</p>
<p>A slight blush appears on her cheeks as she looks puzzled. Then, I told Ogura who was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san is my bride.」</p>
<p>「W-what are you saying!?」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「O-Ogura-san, why are you so silent!? Ah! Mou! I don’t understand!?」</p>
<p>At the same time Kurumi-san&#8217;s voice echoed as she held her head&#8212;-a bell rang signaling the end of the 6<sup>th</sup> period.</p>
