<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; To the Student Guidance Office with a Beautiful Girl </h3>

<p>When we arrived at the classroom, we got more stares from others than earlier.</p>
<p>「You two are late.」</p>
<p>「Sorry.」</p>
<p>「M-my apologies.」</p>
<p>「Okay, go to your seat.」</p>
<p>We followed the words of our homeroom teacher, Monobe-sensei, who was standing at the podium, and went to our seats.</p>
<p>On the way to my seat, I walked next to a student. It’s not that I want to pass by her. It’s just that it’s the shortest route to my seat. As I passed by her, I glanced at the blonde girl.</p>
<p>I hate this Ogura so much.</p>
<p>The other day, I attempted to commit an act of violence against her. The act itself ended in an attempt but even if I had carried it out, I wouldn’t regret it in the slightest. That’s how much I hate this Ogura girl.</p>
<p>The moment I turned my gaze to her&#8212;Ogura looked at me too. As soon as our eyes crossed, Ogura turned her pale face away. I didn’t mean to glare at her but I must admit, I was clenching my fist.</p>
<p>Did I go too far?</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought so. However, she is the main culprit of cornering Kurumi-san. Therefore, I will not push any further-but I will not comfort her either. Perhaps Kurumi-san won’t allow me to push Ogura further.</p>
<p>That’s how kind she is. It won’t even be a surprise if she reaches out to her. She’s that kind and one of the things I love about her.</p>
<p>I quickly turned my gaze away from Ogura and sat down on my chair.</p>
<p>After Monobe-sensei’s boring homeroom was over, everyone started to prepare for the next class or talk to their friend. I also stood out to talk with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「Long distance relationship is hard, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「We are in the same classroom and only a few meters away.」</p>
<p>While talking with Kurumi-san as usual, I took a look around the classroom to get an idea of its current state. I was in the middle of the classroom during homeroom earlier so I couldn’t tell but now, it’s break time. The true “atmosphere” of the class that doesn’t come out when there’s a teacher around will surface. It was easy to infer from Ogura’s reaction that yesterday’s case had an impact so I need to verify the change.</p>
<p>&#8212;then, suddenly, I felt something strange.</p>
<p>I wondered what it could be but before I could find the answer, I was approached from behind. It was Monobe-sensei who was supposed to have left the classroom. He was peeking in at the window from the hallway while holding his attendance book.</p>
<p>「Hey, you were late. I also want to know about you skipping yesterday so come to the student guidance office at lunchtime.」</p>
<p>「I’m very sorry but I’m planning to deepen my love with Kurumi-san during lunch break so, can we refrain from going…?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean by deepen!? There’s no love to deepen to begin with!?」</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「A-about what?」</p>
<p>「Are you sure that there’s no love to deepen?」</p>
<p>I put my face closer to hers and stared at her. She turned red and looked in a different direction.</p>
<p>「There’s no love! Nothing!」</p>
<p>She’s kind of childish but she’s very cute. Kurumi-san is a beautiful girl so she’s more pretty than cute. That’s why her childishness is strangely heart-pounding. I mean, what I’m trying to say is&#8212;</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san, I’ll definitely make you happy.」</p>
<p>「Don’t suddenly declare a strange resolution!」</p>
<p>「Ah, sorry if I’m interrupting your flirting time but, I’m not only asking you. You too, Koga. You two skipped together, right?」</p>
<p>「I’ll go wherever Kurumi-san goes. So, lunch break will be at the student guidance office. Affirmative.」</p>
<p>「You’re like that even with sensei….but the outer moat is already, argh….」</p>
<p>Looking sideways at Kurumi-san, who is holding her head down against the desk, Monobe-sensei puts his hand between his eyebrows and sighs loudly, turning back his heel to us and leaving the classroom.</p>
<p>「Haa….then, I already told what I need to. Don’t forget it and both of you need to go.」</p>
<p>I saw off Monobe-sensei and resumed my conversation with Kurumi-san.</p>

<p>During lunch break, Kurumi-san and I went to the student guidance office.</p>
<p>When we knocked on the door, Monobe-sensei’s voice answered so we went in and sat down on the pipe chairs that had been prepared for us. He began by saying “Like I said this morning” and asked about the skipping incident.</p>
<p>For a moment, I didn’t know how much to tell him.</p>
<p>Of course, he knew that Kurumi-san was being bullied. Even so, knowing something doesn’t mean he can do something about it. In terms of position, he’s probably similar to Kirishima-kun. He knows and he wants to stop it but couldn’t just find a way to do so.</p>
<p>Saying “stop bullying her” to a class where bullying is happening won’t have the slightest effect. All he can do is to sit back and watch.</p>
<p>If you really want to stop it, you have to do it with the resolve of making enemies with everyone aside from that person. That’s what I’m doing right now. After all, what cornered her was now “cruelty” but the oppressing “atmosphere”.</p>
<p>How far should I tell him?</p>
<p>Should I tell him Ogura’s cruelty, being poured with water&#8212;the attempted suicide?</p>
<p>What should I say? What should I not say? While I was thinking about it, Kurumi-san suddenly grabbed my hand. When I was about to ask her what was wrong&#8212;she opened her mouth and began explaining it herself.</p>
<p>She didn’t say anything about her suicide attempt but she’s trembling while talking. When she talked about the oppression, she squeezed my hand tightly. I squeezed her hand back as a sign that I’m on her side.</p>
<p>Eventually, it took a different form and before I knew it, our fingers were already intertwined&#8212;it’s the so-called lover’s bond.</p>
<p>「&#8212;I was soaking wet so he took me home.」</p>
<p>She really didn’t talk that much but Kurumi-san was emaciated. I can only say words of appreciation.</p>
<p>「You worked hard.」</p>
<p>「…..I just can’t have you help me all the time.」</p>
<p>This is the typical Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「I understood a lot about the situation. I know that I have no right to praise you but&#8212;Koga, I’m sorry I couldn’t help you.」</p>
<p>Sensei put his hands on his knees and bowed deeply.</p>
<p>「N-no, that’s……」</p>
<p>After bowing to Kurumi-san, sensei straightens his posture and faces me.</p>
<p>「As for you, thank you for helping Koga.」</p>
<p>「…yeah.」</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this. Even I only watch as Kurumi-san loses her place in the class. Now I’ve decided to love Kurumi-san more than everything else and help her but I was not that different from sensei since I have only started doing it a little while ago.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I’m someone who deserves to be thanked.</p>
<p>「…I don’t know what you are thinking but at least you are doing well. Otherwise, things won’t be as they are now, right?」</p>
<p>Sensei raised one of his eyebrows and pointed between me and Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>When I looked at what he was pointing at, I saw our tightly connected hands. I looked at it and then looked at Kurumi-san. Then, my gaze met hers.</p>
<p>「…..ah」</p>
<p>Her face turned red. She turned away and slowly tried to pull her hand off mine but I ignored her and squeezed it tightly. I then turned to sensei and said….</p>
<p>「Now that you mentioned it….I guess things went well! I’ll show you that the two of us will survive this crisis in our love! And eventually, get married! I will invite you to our wedding so please make sure you’ll come!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean “our”? I don’t love you! I mean, I’m not getting married!」</p>
<p>「You are still as shy as ever～」</p>
<p>「I’m not shy!」</p>
<p>「Hey, you two. Don’t start a lover’s quarrel here.」</p>
<p>「Sensei!?」</p>
<p>Hearing what sensei had said, Kurumi-san shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>「Anyway, this time, it’s not your fault so go back to your classroom.」</p>
<p>「Okay.」</p>
<p>I left the student guidance room with Kurumi-san, who was silently speaking in a voice only she could hear next to me.</p>
<p>「L-lover’s quarrel….?&#8230;.I’m not happy. I’m not happy at all.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
