<p class="has-text-align-center">Future Bride</p>
<p>Do you really not mind the negative things that our classmates are saying about me?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">Because love is blind.</p>
<p>Idiot</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">It can&#8217;t be helped. My love for Kurumi-san is overflowing so I won&#8217;t stop.<br>By the way, I registered your name in my contact as &#8220;Future Bride&#8221;.</p>
<p>Are you insane!?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">Right. I guess I should have wrote &#8220;Girlfriend&#8221; first.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t you take a look at reality?</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">Because love is blind.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just escaping reality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right">Yeah, thank you so much.<br>By the way, I was at Kurumi-san&#8217;s house yesterday.<br>I went there, and found that she&#8217;s just too cute.<br>But that&#8217;s something that can&#8217;t be helped, right? I mean, who made her such an angel?<br>I mean, I&#8217;ve always think that she&#8217;s an angel but…<br>What do you think?</p>
<p>Good night</p>

<p>…..What? Ehto, thanks.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">I can&#8217;t believe that my brother could have such a beautiful girlfriend.<br>Am I going to see my nieces and nephews soon?</p>
<p>I-it&#8217;s true that we&#8217;re going out but that doesn&#8217;t mean we will do such things.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">We&#8217;re talking about my brother desu yo? He&#8217;s bratonic.<br>Imposible desu yo. Just impossible.<br>TN:Bratonic here means he&#8217;s lusting after his first loves regardless of whether that person feels anything back towards him.</p>
