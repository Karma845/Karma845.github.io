<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Weekend with a Beautiful Girl!</h3>

<p>I was preparing for the game while exchanging words with Kurumi-san until Kasumi returned. Within a few minutes, she was back in the room with a tray of juice for the three of us. I thank her thinking she has done something for us.</p>
<p>「Thanks, Kasumi.」</p>
<p>「Thank you, Kasumi-chan.」</p>
<p>「No, you don’t have to mind it.」</p>
<p>After saying that, Kasumi sat down next to Kurumi-san’s left side. I’m sitting on her right side so she’s being sandwiched by us, siblings. Thanks to this, we are so close to each other that I can feel her body heat on my arm.</p>
<p>Recently, we have been holding hands, poking each other with our elbows. In short, our body touches have been increasing but I feel nervous thinking about it again. In fact, we are doing those unconsciously and because of our distance now, whether we are touching or not, we are more conscious of each other than usual.</p>
<p>We prepared for the game while trying not to let each other know how nervous we were. The racing game we are going to play this time has many courses and the aim is to get first place in each course. One of the features of this game is that there are boxes called “items” in the courses which can be taken to obstruct your opponents or temporarily increase the speed of your character.</p>
<p>In other words, this game is a game in which a great comeback is possible depending on your luck.</p>
<p>There are two ways to play this racing game.</p>
<p>The first is to control your character using the joystick of the controller. This method is for easy control and allows the player to achieve stable rankings.</p>
<p>The second is gyro control, in which the controller itself will be tilted as if it was a steering wheel. This method can be quite strange until you get used to it but it is ideal for those who just want to have fun.</p>
<p>Each of us is now holding our controllers and everyone has chosen gyro controls.</p>
<p>「I’ve never played this game before, is it easy?」</p>
<p>「It’s easy. It is a fun game for both adults and children. Even Kurumi-san will get used to it right away! Let’s get it on!」</p>
<p>「O-okay!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san enthusiastically gripped her controller.</p>
<p>I took control of the game and let the race begin.</p>
<p>By the way, I’m not very good at this game. Kasumi is pretty good at it but I’m always in the middle. In fact, I wanted to try some other games that I’m good at since I want to show off to Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>Even so, I decided to play this racing game Marimo Kart.</p>
<p>It is because of a certain reason&#8212;&#8212;!!</p>
<p>A short while after the race has started, Kurumi-san’s character comes to the left curve of the course. She tilted her controller to move her character and of course, her body tilted with her.</p>
<p>「A-ah, s-sorry, Kasumi-chan.」</p>
<p>「No no, everyone does that at first.」</p>
<p>Kasumi is right, when you try to play this game with gyro controls, you will end up tilting your body along with the controller in the beginning. It is also “normal” to bump into the person playing next to you.</p>
<p>I have already confirmed that Kurumi-san is not a game enthusiast when I visited her house the other day. Therefore, I thought.</p>
<p>&#8212;If I let Kurumi-san play Marimo Kart, I thought it would be possible for her to realize that we are in a rom-com situation in which our shoulders would bump against each other making her heart pound.</p>
<p>And it seems that I was right. However, it looks like I miscalculated.</p>
<p>「Ha, hahahaha」</p>
<p>「Mou, Kurumi-san, you’re sticking too much.」</p>
<p>「S-sorry about that, Kasumi-chan!」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha, it’s okay desu yo～」</p>
<p>If there’s a left curve, Kurumi-san will bump into Kasumi, who’s on her left. If there’s a right curve, Kurumi-san will just brace herself for the collision and won’t bump into me.</p>
<p>And another left curve. She bumped into Kasumi again.</p>
<p>「…..Kasumi, how about we change places?」</p>
<p>「Huh? Okay.」</p>
<p>When I suggested that after the end of the first race, she was suspicious but agreed.</p>
<p>Then, the second race started, and…for some reason, the left curve never came. Or rather, the course is mostly right curves.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, there were many(real-life) collisions between Kurumi-san and Kasumi.</p>
<p>「T-this is hard….」</p>
<p>「Mou, Kurumi-san, you suck at this～」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「I-it’s because it’s my first time….」</p>
<p>「Wait, let me hold your hand a little…..Here, it’s like this.」</p>
<p>「Kasumi-chan, you’re so good!」</p>
<p>「Even though I’m playing like this, I’m still better than aniki.」</p>
<p>「Really? I mean, yay! Second place! Kasumi-chan…first place!? Amazing!」</p>
<p>「Being second place is awesome too, Kurumi-san. It’s only your second game after all!」</p>
<p>「R-really? Ehehe」</p>
<p>「……..! M-mou! Kurumi-san, you’re so adorableeeeee!」</p>
<p>Kasumi hugs the smiling Kurumi-san. Flirting, flirting, flirting.</p>
<p>A yuri space was formed right next to me. What’s this?</p>
<p>This is totally different from my original plan. And finally, I too have reached the goal…..</p>
<p>The character I was controlling was taken out of control just before the goal. Then, a system message appeared at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>『The game has been terminated because the ranking has been finalized.』</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san, Kurumi-san, which stage would you like to go next?」</p>
<p>「I don’t know which stage is good. Does Kasumi-chan have a recommendation?」</p>
<p>「Then, how about here?」</p>
<p>「Waaa, it looks beautiful.」</p>
<p>「R-right! And at this stage, the season will change randomly!」</p>
<p>「Heh, there’s snow on the ground so it’s winter?」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>These two are completely ignoring me.</p>
<p>What am I going to do? It looks like Kurumi-san is going to be NTRd by my little sister.</p>


<p>After that, we continued the game but only the two made out. I was always out of the mosquito net. I feel alienated and somewhat hazy inside. Also…</p>
<p>「Mou, you really did it, Kasumi-chan.」</p>
<p>「Payback for attacking me just now.」</p>
<p>Seeing Kurumi-san&#8217;s happy expression, I think, well, I guess everything’s fine. I took a sip of the juice on the desk and then, regripped the controller tightly and turned my gaze to the game screen.</p>
<p>The item I’m currently holding is the “thunder”&#8212;the most powerful item that damages all players at the same time.</p>
<p>「Don’t forget about meeeeeee!」</p>
<p>I fired it without hesitation at the two who were flirting and treating me as an outcast.</p>

<p>After playing the game for a while, we decided to take a breather and have lunch. It is now one o’clock in the afternoon. It’s already a little late but I think it is still acceptable.</p>
<p>In fact, I wanted her to stay for dinner and as thanks for letting me stay over at her place the other night but since Kurumi-san said she didn’t want to see my parents, I decided to bring her over before noon and treat her to lunch.</p>
<p>I stood in the kitchen with Kasumi. Kurumi-san is a guest so I asked her to sit at the dining table and watch TV.</p>
<p>「Hey, how about making me help with something?」</p>
<p>「Yeah yeah, thank you but we’ll have to cook together some other time.」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?&#8230;.yeah, I understand.」</p>
<p>「By the way, next time I’ll invite you not as a friend but as my girlfriend. Then, as the daughter in law&#8212;」</p>
<p>「W-we are not even married!」</p>
<p>It was Kasumi who responded to Kurumi-san’s denial.</p>
<p>「Then, are you thinking of going out first?」</p>
<p>「Ka-Kasumi-chan!?」</p>
<p>Unexpected words from an unexpected person. Kurumi-san raised her voice.</p>
<p>「Ah, well, you see. You said you’re not even married now but you didn’t deny it so I’m kind of wondering.」</p>
<p>「I, ah, gwu…..w-well, that, I don’t know much about dating….」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san answers in a whisper while looking away.</p>
<p>「Ahahah, it&#8217;s a joke desu yo, I’m only kidding. Now, since I’ve already done the prep work, we will be taking this over there soon.」</p>
<p>「Aniki, can you bring it there?」</p>
<p>As requested, I brought the pot to Kurumi-san without saying a word. It was almost the cold season. It was already November so we have chosen the dish, nabe.</p>
<p>I put in the vegetables, prepared the meat, and laid out the chopsticks for the three of us on the table.</p>
<p>「It looks delicious.」</p>
<p>「Of course! It is our family’s special “super nabe” desu!」</p>
<p>「Super, nabe?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san tilted her head after hearing Kasumi. I explained it to her while pointing to each ingredient.</p>
<p>「The broth was bought from the supermarket, the vegetables were bought from the supermarket, the tofu was bought from the supermarket, the meat and meatballs were bought from the supermarket. That’s why it is called “super” nabe.」</p>
<p>「Then, isn’t this no different from a normal nabe?」</p>
<p>「No, it has one secret ingredient.」</p>
<p>「Eh? What what!?」</p>
<p>I stick out my index finger to Kurumi-san, who looks very curious, and answer.</p>
<p>「The secret ingredient is….my love for Kurumi-san!」</p>
<p>「…..let’s eat, Kasumi-chan.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「Right, let’s eat.」</p>
<p>「….I’m going to cry.」</p>
<p>My heart aches as my dialog was easily thrown away. I sit in my place at the table with my shoulders slumped. Kasumi was sitting at the opposite side of Kurumi-san so I inevitably ended up next to her. Kasumi and I are sitting directly opposite to each other.</p>
<p>「Maa, if it’s her, I guess it’s okay.」</p>
<p>&#8212;suddenly, I thought I heard Kasumi muttering something like that.</p>
<p>「Did you say something?」</p>
<p>「…..what could I say?」</p>
<p>It looks like Kusumi-san seemed to have heard her. Her expression is a little strange.</p>
<p>「Maa, maa, let’s eat.」</p>
<p>Kasumi mumbles a few words and puts her hands together. I’m curious but she has no intention of telling me. I don’t want to force her to tell me something she doesn’t want to say so I tried not to worry about it and put my hands together too. Kurumi-san also puts her hands together&#8212;</p>
<p>「「「Itadakimasu!」」」</p>
<p>The three of us reached the nabe with our chopsticks.</p>
