<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; I’m, I…..! </h3>


<p>When we came back to my room after eating, we started playing again. This was because Kurumi-san got hooked on the game unexpectedly. We ran and played a few more races and as we were talking about what would be the last race, Kasumi unexpectedly made a suggestion.</p>
<p>「Do you think it is interesting to do it….a punishment game?」</p>
<p>「No, no, Kasumi is too overwhelming.」</p>
<p>「Right. Kasumi-chan is almost always the first place.」</p>
<p>By the way, Kurumi-san and I are changing places to the middle and the last.</p>
<p>「Of course, I know. That’s why it will be a punishment game battle between the two of you…since it’s a punishment game, the loser must accept the winner’s demand.」</p>
<p>Kasumi smiles as she stares at us.</p>
<p>「I see…..Okay, let’s do it! Let’s do it now! Let’s play, Kurumi-san! I’m going to be serious this time! I won’t cut corners because I love you!」</p>
<p>「I didn’t say I agree! Also, I won’t participate! I can’t see any benefits in winning….」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「The loser must listen to any demand. You can even order that lunatic to stay away from you!」</p>
<p>「….b-but I don’t want him to stay away from me.」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「……w-what did I!? That’s not it!? I-it’s because we’re friends!?」</p>
<p>「No, it’s because….of love.」</p>
<p>「………! W-why are you…..! Even in front of Kasumi-chan, you’re still acting like that….g-got it! Then, if I win, you should stop acting like that in front of Kasumi-chan!」</p>
<p>「What exactly do you mean?」</p>
<p>「H-how should I say it….right right. I mean, marriage, love, future sister-in-law, etc….don’t say things related to those in front of Kasumi-chan! And….about the future too.」</p>
<p>「? Okay.」</p>
<p>If you really want to ban me from saying those, why do you even add the “in front of Kasumi” condition? Well, I’m not going to say that because I don’t want to startle the snake on the bush.</p>
<p>「….this denseness.」</p>
<p>「Kasumi-chan, did you say anything?」</p>
<p>「Nothing, so, are you two okay with it?」</p>
<p>「Yeah!」</p>
<p>「Uhuh!」</p>
<p>「Then…..<em>ready, go</em>!」</p>

<p>I won. I’m convinced that the power of love is the greatest.</p>
<p>「So, Kasumi, let me reintroduce her to you. This is Koga Kurumi. My future wife and your future sister-in-law.」</p>
<p>「Whoah, it’s going to be fun every day when you become part of our family, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>「U-ugh……K-Kasumi-chan……」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha, I’m just joking desu yo.」</p>
<p>Kasumi pats the head of the disappointed Kurumi-san. As for me, I’m not joking or anything but I’m not a boorish person that will interrupt two people who seem to be having a good time.</p>
<p>「Then, Kurumi-san, it’s almost time, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>When I ask her, she looks at the wall clock in my room. It is already six o’clock.</p>
<p>「Yeah, it is already time! Then, I’ll take my leave&#8212;」</p>
<p>As she stands up and starts to leave the room, Kasumi grabs her by her sleeve and holds her back. As I was wondering why she was doing that, she looked at me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「I had one last thing to talk to her so can you please leave us alone?」</p>
<p>「? A-ah, okay.」</p>
<p>I don’t know what it is but since she asked me to leave my room, I’ll leave. I left my room&#8212;-yeah. Since she seems like she doesn’t want me to hear what she’s going to tell her, I should close the door. For some reason, the door of my room was left open all the time.</p>
<p>「Ah, wait, that idiot&#8212;」</p>
<p>I thought I heard Kasumi saying something but it must have been my imagination.</p>
