<h3>Chapter 8.5 &#8211; I’ll Definitely Take This Secret to the Grave….! </h3>


<p>Morning. I, Koga Kurumi, woke up with a faint feeling of fatigue and a strange chill. I thought it was just morning laziness so I rubbed my sleepy eyes. Then, I stare at the boy lying next to me&#8212;I thought of what happened last night.</p>

<p>A faint sound of breathing was coming from right next to me.</p>
<p>He has been saying that he loves me but even though we are in the same bed, he did nothing and just tried to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8212;that’s normal.</p>
<p>Because I had given him…. sleeping pills.</p>
<p>I had prepared a cup of tea for him while he was in the shower and I had put some sleeping pills in it. When it was around the time we had to go to bed, I realized that I only had one bed. He will surely want to sleep with me so I had him drink some sleeping pills to protect myself.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that this is wrong.</p>
<p>However, if I didn’t&#8212;if he presses me on the bed, I am not sure if I could resist.</p>
<p>As a result, he is currently sleeping due to the effect of the sleeping pills. Everything went according to plan. All that was left was for me to go to sleep too. Yeah, let’s sleep…..</p>
<p>&#8212;but I’m super horny.</p>
<p>What was wrong with me? I was thinking of committing suicide lately so I haven’t had time to masturbate. And there were those two kisses too.</p>
<p>Y-yeah! It was all those kisses&#8217; fault! I mean, sure, I kissed him first but there’s no way I could take the surprised kiss! It’s the first time I’ve even been kissed so I’m bound to be….conscious of it.</p>
<p>This is why I’m so horny. How can my libido rise to an unprecedented height during the worst time?</p>
<p>In a situation where the boy, who was the source of it, was sleeping right next to me.</p>
<p>I like&#8212;no. I shouldn’t like him. No, only his lunatic part but I can say that I might like him. Though it’s probably because “He’s the only one I can depend on”, I think that he’s fine to be my first time.</p>
<p>&#8212;No, my first time……..I- I’m……I can’t let………..I’m just being emotional……ah, this feeling makes my head hurt.</p>
<p>「……hey, do you want to have sex?」</p>
<p>And, I asked it myself.</p>
<p>The moment I said it, I regretted it terribly. Those words would change our relationship forever. Anxious and frustrated, I waited for an answer. However, all I could hear was his regular breathing.</p>
<p>I tried over to check and saw that he was sleeping.</p>
<p>「Hey, are you really sleeping?」</p>
<p>I asked even though it was very obvious.</p>
<p>「……kuh…….kuh」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>I poked his check but….he won’t wake up.</p>
<p>I made my hand crawl his left arm and….nothing happened.</p>
<p>「Hey」</p>
<p>I hugged his left arm….he didn’t wake up.</p>
<p>Apparently, he’s completely sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>I unconsciously swallowed my saliva.</p>
<p>I wriggle around and move over to his sleeping body. I was careful in order to make sure he wouldn&#8217;t wake up. As our bodies get close to each other, our body temperature mingles and becomes very warm.</p>
<p>Our faces are so close with each other, so close that we could feel each other’s breath&#8212;so close that the tip of our noses touch&#8212;and we can feel each other’s temperature with our skins.</p>
<p>「Aren’t you going to wake up?」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「……idiot….hmmmmm」</p>
<p>I press my own lips against him, following the emotions I’m feeling. And my sense of reason crumbled.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Let’s just say, I attacked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p>………..let me just say this frankly, I didn’t mean this!</p>
<p>I hold my head while on the bed. The time was around five minutes after 6 in the morning.</p>
<p>W-w-what’s happening! Why is it so cold! Eh!? Why am I in my underwear! Was I too tired last night that I went to be like this!?</p>
<p>「P-pa-pajama pajama…..」</p>
<p>I sneak out of the bed so as not to wake him up and wear my pajamas that were scattered in the room.</p>
<p>….hnn? Wait a minute. I’m in my underwear, does this mean&#8212;I put my gaze on the lower body of the guy sleeping on my bed.</p>
<p>N-no no, as expected, no matter how tired I was last night, I will surely tidy it up.</p>
<p>I turned the futon over and checked the inside part….okay! All right! Well done, me from yesterday! In the first place, I shouldn’t have worried about it since the me from yesterday should have taken care of everything!</p>
<p>Perhaps, last night, after cleaning the mess, I ran out of steam and fell asleep before I could wear my pajamas back.</p>
<p>I’m so glad I woke up before him.</p>
<p>I put on my pajamas and went straight to the living room. There was no way I could stay in the same room with him any longer. I feel like I’m going to die of embarrassment.</p>

<p>「So, this is what they call….midnight <em>tension</em>.」</p>
<p>TN: Midnight tension is being highly emotional and doing something impulsive late at night. What happened in this story aside, buying a lot on amazon late at night for no reason can be considered midnight tension too.</p>
<p>On the day I got drunk and kissed, I had a midnight <em>tension</em> in the form of yobai*.</p>
<p>TN: Yobai is an ancient Japanese custom usually practiced by young unmarried men and women. At night, young unmarried men would silently enter houses with young unmarried women. A man would silently crawl into a woman&#8217;s room and make his intentions known. If the woman consented, they would sleep together. By the morning he would leave. The girl&#8217;s family might know about it, but pretend they did not. It was common for young people to find a husband/wife like this.</p>
<p>….could I be someone with a strong sex drive? In the past, I had been doing it once every two days although I rarely did it these days. Since I don’t have friends, I can’t tell if my sex drive is normal or not.</p>
<p>「However, that’s not the point right now….」</p>
<p>The question is whether to tell him about this. I know I should tell him. No matter what I say, what I did was a crime. Maybe.</p>
<p>So, I tried to imagine what would happen if I told him.</p>
<p>『I’m sorry! I used sleeping pills to put you to sleep and then crawled over you!』</p>
<p>『Whaaaatttt!? I don’t remember! Let’s do it again! I mean right now! By the way, what would you like to name our child? Do you have a preferred education plan? I think I’d like them to learn English from an early age but of course, I will respect our child’s will!』</p>
<p>After such a conversation, I could easily imagine us having sex, falling for each other, and having a child.</p>
<p>「M-maa, there’s no such future&#8212;none!」</p>
<p>For a moment, I wanted to punch myself for thinking that would be good. Or rather, I did. My cheek hurts.</p>
<p>「N-no, we should take one step at a time.」</p>
<p>100 steps, no 100 million steps are required to have a good marriage. He is a better person compared to anyone else even if he sometimes acts like a lunatic, a creep, or even annoying. However, marriage is difficult for high school students. We have to consider school, parents, money, and so on.</p>
<p>Besides….</p>
<p>『As expected, Kurumi-san wants to marry me too! Let’s build a warm home!』</p>
<p>I’m only thinking of it and I’m already angry. I’m very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Even so, it was me who crawled up to him because of midnight <em>tension </em>so I’m all at fault here!</p>
<p>&#8212;even so….that’s right. I…</p>
<p>Then, my head started boiling and my heart ached as if it was tightened by something.</p>
<p>「〜〜〜〜!」</p>
<p>I can’t stay standing still so I went around the living room in circles while calming my heart down. I jumped onto the sofa and flapped my legs.</p>
<p>「What, should….」</p>
<p>I’m panicking but I don’t feel bad. “I can’t let him see me like this”, I muttered that as I plopped my face into the cushion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「O-okay! I’ll just keep my mouth shut. I’ll definitely take this secret to the grave….!」</p>
<p>I clenched my fist tightly and made up my mind before starting to make breakfast. I’m not going to let my acting experience go to waste. I will behave in front of him as I always do!</p>
<p>I won’t let it show in my face, I won’t bite my own tongue!</p>
<p>&#8212;that thought of mine was broken down early by his greetings a few minutes later but I didn’t know at this time yet.</p>
