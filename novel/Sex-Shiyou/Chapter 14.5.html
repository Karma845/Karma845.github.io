<h3>Chapter 14.5 &#8211; I’m…. </h3>


<p>I, Koga Kurumi, was left alone with his sister, Kasumi-chan, in his room. It is already getting dark outside the window. It was 6 o’clock in November so that’s normal. Kasumi-chan said she wanted to talk with me alone so she kicked him out of the room but I wonder what she wants to speak about.</p>
<p>He also left the room without objecting&#8212;eh?</p>
<p>「Ah, wait, that idiot!&#8212;hah」</p>
<p>Behind the closed door&#8212;on the place that had not been visible since I came here&#8212;was my poster. In fact, I had been looking for something like this since I entered his room. All I saw in his room was anime-related goods and light novels and I wasn’t able to find any of my magazines or posters.</p>
<p>It’s not like I’m happy about it! Absolutely not! I just thought it would be nice to have something with me in it since he has always been telling me he loves me or he wants to marry me! Ye-yeah! That’s the only reason!</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san?」</p>
<p>「W-what!?」</p>
<p>「No, I’m just wondering why are you smiling like that.」</p>
<p>「H-hehhh!? T-that’s not true!?」</p>
<p>After denying it immediately, I put both of my hands on my mouth. Kasumi-chan gave out a long sigh.</p>
<p>「….haa. Ano, I want to ask you something.」</p>
<p>「W-what is it?」</p>
<p>Her voice is quite serious. It is very different from her usual cheerful voice. It even made my spine involuntarily stiffen. She was supposed to be younger than me but she looked so dignified that I could have been fooled into thinking she’s as old or even older than me.</p>
<p>「My aniki, do you like him?」</p>
<p>「&#8212;heh? Ah, t-th, we-well, its…..」</p>
<p>I desperately want to say words of denial but my tongue trembles on its own and I wasn’t able to say anything clearly. How can an actress like me act like this? This can’t be happening….! Why is my mouth not listening to me!?</p>
<p>「You like him after all.」</p>
<p>「N-n-n-n-no-no, Y-yo-your o-o-oniisan, isss, only….friend…..」</p>
<p>「If that’s true, why are you acting like that?」</p>
<p>「Ugh…..」</p>
<p>「Well, it is all good.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>As I was confused over what she meant or what she was trying to say, Kasumi-chan’s eyes quickly turned to the side of the TV and smiled. I didn’t notice there was something like that there but there was a picture of him and Kasumi-chan when they were still very young.</p>
<p>They are holding hands and are smiling happily.</p>
<p>「I had a great day today…however, I owe you an apology.」</p>
<p>「You owe me an apology?」</p>
<p>「Yes, I do. Today, I pretended to be Kurumi-san’s good friend.」</p>
<p>「…….!」</p>
<p>「Ah, d-don’t look at me like that! I really enjoyed it and I’m also honestly wanting to continue that kind of relationship with you if possible!&#8212;I only acted when I met you. I’m sorry.」</p>
<p>My heart aches hearing what she said. Because I had enjoyed talking with Kasumi-chan from the start until now. It was just like those days when I hadn&#8217;t started my career as a magazine model yet, the time when I still had friends….</p>
<p>Tears accumulated in my eyes on their own but I bit my lower lip to protect my dignity as the older one. I also blink many times in order to make sure they won’t spill from my eyes. After giving out a heavy breath, I asked her why with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>「W-why?」</p>
<p>「…..because he’s my brother desu.」</p>
<p>「?」</p>
<p>「My brother was normal until recently&#8212;No, he might be feeling depressed or worried about something but he was still normal. It wasn’t like today. This is the first time I’ve seen him act and say things I can’t fully understand like a lunatic.」</p>
<p>Kasumi takes a deep breath and continues.</p>
<p>「I thought it was Kurumi-san who drove my brother to go crazy like that. No, I’m convinced that it can only be Kurumi-san who drove him crazy. Every time he goes home, he’ll say Kurumi-san this, Kurumi-san that every single day. So….I thought he was being deceived. He’s acting like a lunatic after all.」</p>
<p>I didn’t realize it until she told me so. I certainly think his words and actions are strange too. I thought he was a lunatic&#8212;or at least that’s my impression. Yes, I have been feeling happy and comfortable with his words and actions recently but from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party’s point of view, those should be quite abnormal.</p>
<p>If your family began to love someone fanatically&#8212;and if they had shown signs of being troubled just before that&#8212;</p>
<p>You would have thought that he fell into a vicious religion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「……」</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to say anything.</p>
<p>I was….I was always with him and we talked every day but I didn’t even notice it at all. I was starting to get used to the love I was getting from him.</p>
<p>My heart aches, I can’t even look at Kasumi-chan’s face. I can only bow to her.</p>
<p>「However, after seeing you two all day&#8212;well, actually, half a day….anyway, I’ve been watching over the two of you and noticed it.」</p>
<p>「……noticed what?」</p>
<p>When I looked up at Kasumi-chan, she smiled and told me.</p>
<p>「What else? A genuine bakaple!」</p>
<p>TN: Bakaple is short for baka couple or idiot couple.</p>
<p>「….eh? n-no, it-it’s, you’re wrong! I and your oniisan are not in that relationship&#8212;」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「Are you sure about that?」</p>
<p>Kasumi-chan stared at me with her normal expression which I have seen all day but…for some reason, my face started to heat up.</p>
<p>Hot. It’s November and it’s this hot. What’s going on?</p>
<p>「You are not dating?」</p>
<p>「W-we’re not in that kind of relationship.」</p>
<p>「Have you held hands?」</p>
<p>「………yeah」</p>
<p>「Then, have you put your arms around each other?」</p>
<p>「………yeah」</p>
<p>I answered all of Kasumi-chan’s questions instinctively.</p>
<p>Why? I can’t deny anything in front of her….Kasumi-chan, why is my body not listening to me at all? Maybe it’s because I played with her all day that I trusted her? Or is it because I’ve accepted her as a friend?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I have no idea why. Even so, I’m sure she can tell what I’m really thinking&#8212;n-no, she can’t! It’s just, ethou, ehto, what? I don’t know. But every time I answer a question, I feel pain in my heart. It’s tight and painful. It’s painful but my body is warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>Ignoring my state of confusion, Kasumi-chan continued to ask questions.</p>
<p>「Have you ever hugged each other?」</p>
<p>「………yeah」</p>
<p>「Now, then&#8212;」</p>
<p>Kasumi-chan looked at me and asked.</p>
<p>「Have you ever kissed each other?」</p>
<p>My heartbeat shoots up as I remember that day.</p>
<p>I&#8212;kissed.</p>
<p>I&#8212;kissed him.</p>
<p>And I couldn’t hold back anymore.</p>
<p>「………hmmm」</p>
<p>I answered in a muffled voice and shook my head.</p>
<p>My chest is in agony. The moment she asked if we kissed, I felt more pain than ever.</p>
<p>「Your face, it’s bright red.」</p>
<p>「～～～～! Yaa, do-don’t look, Kasumi-chan…」</p>
<p>「Still like that. Last question.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<p>「No, no, don’t ask….」</p>
<p>If you ask that, I will answer.</p>
<p>If you ask that, you will know.</p>
<p>I’m going to admit it.</p>
<p>I’ve been running away.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>Don’t.</p>
<p>Don’t.</p>
<p>Don’t…..</p>
<p>I’m rejecting her with everything I have in my mind but Kasumi-chan continued to ask without hesitation.</p>
<p>「&#8212;my aniki, do you like him?」</p>
<p>「………yeah」</p>
