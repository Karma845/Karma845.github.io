<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; How’s the Taste of Your Loving Wife’s Bento? </h3>


<p>Mondays have always been an abomination to me. After a leisurely weekend, despair comes. I used to wonder if there is anyone in this world who likes Monday.</p>
<p>However, now, there’s not even the “me” in the word melancholy in my mind. Why?</p>
<p>It’s because the cutest little creature in the world is standing right next to me, slightly biting her lower lip, occasionally glancing at me, but when our eyes meet, she’ll turn her head away like a cute little pet.</p>
<p>She has long black hair, a well-defined face, and at first glance, she looks too mature to be someone as old as me but the glimpses of how she’s behaving are definitely someone from my age. I can’t stop being thrilled!</p>
<p>「The best…..」</p>
<p>「W-what are you suddenly saying?」</p>
<p>「Well, now that I’m one step closer to the relationship I have always dreamed of, I’m filled with overflowing happiness that I can’t just contain.」</p>
<p>「I-is that so?&#8230;..I-I’m…..h-happy too….」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san is saying something while our hands are locked with each other and pouting her lips. However, I wasn’t able to hear what she said.</p>
<p>In addition, this is the route to our school and there are many students on their way to school. I wouldn’t be able to hear her that much because of the noise of the crowd.</p>
<p>The truth is, I don’t want to miss a single word of what Kurumi-san said….</p>
<p>「Sorry, can you say it one more time?」</p>
<p>「….y-you’re doing it on purpose!?」</p>
<p>When I asked her to say it again, Kurumi-san reacted like an offended cat.</p>
<p>「What’s do you mean!?」</p>
<p>「I-I mean, sometimes, you say you miss things like that but I’m sure you’re doing it on purpose!?」</p>
<p>「No no no, I really didn’t hear it!」</p>
<p>When I hurriedly said my excuse, she looked around and turned her gaze away. We had attracted quite a bit of attention because of my response. Her cheeks dyed red with embarrassment. Then, Kurumi-san approached me and stood tiptoed. As if doing what she did the other day, she whispered in my ear.</p>
<p>「Me too…..I’m happy.」</p>
<p>「……..」</p>
<p>「……..s-say something.」</p>
<p>「Alright, then, let’s talk about this overflowing love that’s swelling up in my heart….!」</p>
<p>「I-I’ll pass on that!」</p>
<p>I was about to open my mouth but I was stopped by Kurumi-san. She was the one who asked me to say something and now, she’s stopping me. Anyway, the most important thing is to remember that we can’t talk too long or we’ll be late for school…..</p>
<p>Thus, I’m trying to accept it with a slight shrug of my shoulders&#8212;</p>
<p>「W-well, let’s….talk about it in the future…..」</p>
<p>I thought my brain was going to explode when Kurumi-san told me that as she covered her mouth with her right hand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p>We arrive at the classroom, homeroom starts, and classes begin. However, my gaze was never on the blackboard but on Kurumi-san, who had left me as soon as we entered the classroom&#8212;ah, our eyes met.</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>Bu then, she turned her gaze away with all her might.</p>
<p>How many times has that happened? Every time I glance at her, our gazes meet. Kurumi-san is seated behind me so I don’t see her much but our gazes still intertwine. This is fate, yes?</p>
<p>It was lunchtime and I approached her seat. Normally, I would buy some bread from the store before heading to her but she told me that I don’t have to buy anything today. I felt “discomfort” at the edge of my field of vision but I pretended not to notice it and headed to where Kurumi-san is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;「Finally, I would be able to talk to Kurumi-san. I wonder when the next seat change will be.」</p>
<p>I borrowed a chair from the person seated in front of Kurumi-san and sat down opposite of her.</p>
<p>「C-come to think of it, this is probably the right distance for us.」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「….I can’t concentrate in class.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Now that she mentioned it, I remember what happened during our classes. Every time I glance at Kurumi-san, there will be a hundred percent probability that our gazes will meet. That means that even if I wasn’t looking at her, she was looking at me…what’s with that? I’m so happy.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san loves me more than I thought.」</p>
<p>「….w-wh-wha! What are………ugh……that’s not!?」</p>
<p>「No, I’m happy because I love you too.」</p>
<p>「…..s-stop it. Or else my heart won’t be able to take it…..」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s voice sounds like it’s about to disappear. I’d like to see her embarrassed more but I’m getting a little hungry. If I don’t do something, my lunch break will be over.</p>
<p>「Then, shall we eat lunch?」</p>
<p>「Y-yeah」</p>
<p>After saying that, Kurumi-san took out two bento from her bag.</p>
<p>「Here」</p>
<p>「Thank you. This is my very first loving wife’s bento.」</p>
<p>「I-I’m not your loving wife yet.」</p>
<p>「You will be, sooner or later.」</p>
<p>「….yeah.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san looks up at me and looks down and nods while her cheeks blush.</p>
<p>I’m tempted to run out of the classroom right now and scream out my love for her for the world to hear but I manage to suppress it with my rational mind. I opened the bento. Inside, I found a simple but beautiful array of food.</p>
<p>「Looks delicious.」</p>
<p>「R-really?&#8230;.t-then I’m glad.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san smiled shyly as she scratched her cheeks.</p>
<p>「…..looks so delicious.」</p>
<p>「W-why did you say it twice?」</p>
<p>「Ah, no. I was looking at Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>「?&#8230;&#8230;..AH! S-scum! Lunati-kun is a scum!」</p>
<p>「W-why! I love you so I can’t help it!」</p>
<p>「I mean there’s a time and place for that!」</p>
<p>「Certainly!」</p>
<p>I couldn’t even make a gagging sound when she said that. Instead, I heard a grumbling sound from my stomach. Hearing that, Kurumi-san smiled.</p>
<p>「Shall we eat?」</p>
<p>「I guess so.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s loving wife bento is very tasty. Especially the fried eggs and stir-fried vegetables.</p>
<p>「It’s very tasty!」</p>
<p>「R-really?」</p>
<p>「Especially the secret ingredient, love. I feel it is full of it.」</p>
<p>「I-idiot!」</p>
<p>And so, our school life goes on peacefully.</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>Peacefully…..yes, peacefully&#8212;I wish it had gone on.</p>
<p>I was very concerned about the girl at the corner of my field of vision.</p>
<p>In the corner of the classroom, a lone blonde girl stretches her chopsticks out to her bento. I couldn’t help but be wary of that girl even though she’s not looking at us&#8212;I can’t help but be wary of Ogura. </p>
