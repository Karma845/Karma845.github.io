<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Flirting at Lunch! </h3>

<p>A week has passed since the day I stopped Kurumi-san from committing suicide.</p>
<p>I’m happy to be involved with her, who I’ve never talked with before, and I’ve been spending my days courting her. She was reluctant to talk to me at first but after the 3<sup>rd</sup> day, she started listening to me with a sigh and we are even having lunch together recently.</p>
<p>This way, we have already entered our countdown stage until we get married. Thinking about it&#8212;</p>
<p>I was thrilled.</p>
<p>I felt like my heart was about to burst and my stomach was about to spill out what I just put in my mouth. Let’s wash it down with water first before it really spills out. Like a frog. Croak croak. No no, that’s not it. I’m so nervous that my thoughts have become strange. There’s only one reason why I’m nervous.</p>
<p>It’s all because of the girl who’s currently sitting beside me.</p>
<p>We are currently on the upper floor of a luxurious apartment building, the place where Kurumi-san lives. It seems like she’s living alone with the money she earned. She started her acting career on top of being a model and she seems to be earning a good amount of money.</p>
<p>The room gives off a modern atmosphere and is very stylish. I sat down on the sofa in the room. It was soft. This should be expensive(I’m sure of it).</p>
<p>…..my thoughts went astray again. I don’t really care about the sofa right now. There are more important things than the fact that it’s dark outside or that the lighting in the room is creating a mysterious atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8212;there’s also the presence of Kurumi-san, whose head is currently resting on my shoulder with her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>「Hnn….hmmmmm…..」</p>
<p>「Ahahahahaha」</p>
<p>「sshhhut upp…..」</p>
<p>「(Ahahahahaha)」</p>
<p>I struggled to recall what had happened for us to end up like this using my insufficient brain.</p>
<p>We were at school earlier&#8212;-</p>

<p>「How many children do you want?」</p>
<p>「……..」</p>
<p>「I don’t think we need too many. I only wish that they’ll be products of our love.」</p>
<p>「Heh」</p>
<p>While eating lunch in the classroom, I’m having a nice conversation with Kurumi-san. The topic is about after we got married. I was talking about marriage until the other day and it was decided that our first date will be at Dream Land as it is the safest choice and our wedding would be in Hawaii. She did not reply to any of those but according to an austere anime character father, silence means yes.</p>
<p>「What should we do about the house? As expected, we should rent first and eventually, we will be able to buy a detached house&#8212;」</p>
<p>「Hey」</p>
<p>The one who interrupted me was not Kurumi-san but a blonde-haired, squinty eyed, gyaru. She should be in the upper caste of the class and I think she is called Ogura-san. Because of the sudden appearance of an intruder, not only me but Kurumi-san’s chopsticks also stopped moving.</p>
<p>「……..」</p>
<p>「……..」</p>
<p>「Hey, say something.」</p>
<p>Of course, me and Kurumi-san were silent because we didn’t know who she was talking with and she even dared to protest.</p>
<p>「Oh, what is it? What do you want? As you can see, we’re in the midst of flirting so I want unrelated people to go away. Get lost, shuuu.」</p>
<p>I spoke fast and Kurumi-san kicked my leg under the desk. Only then, I realized that I was angry and blood was rushing to my head. No, just because I don’t like someone doesn’t mean I should cuss them out. If I do that, I’ll fall to their level. I should keep my calm for the best.</p>
<p>「(Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away…..)」</p>
<p>「What are you staring at!」</p>
<p>「Eh? I’m staring at you? I’d appreciate it if you’d stop making such accusations.」</p>
<p>I was kicked under the desk again.</p>
<p>「What?」</p>
<p>As if she had noticed that I was at a loss for words, Ogura-san spoke with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「….haa, I just came to say that you’re an eyesore.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>


<p>Ogura-san crosses her arms over her plump chest and snickers. Kurumi-san’s tone clearly dropped as she asked about her unreasonable words.</p>
<p>「What are you trying to say?」</p>
<p>「I’m talking about how you flirt with that lunatic. You should stop making noise in the classroom because I feel sick.」</p>
<p>「…….I’m not.」</p>
<p>「Eh? What?」</p>
<p>「That’s not…..it…..」</p>
<p>「I can’t hear you. If you want something to say, say it clear.」</p>
<p>Ogura-san put her hand over her ears and asked with an annoyed expression. The atmosphere is getting worse and worse. I hate her. I hate this person. In the first place, she’s the reason why everything’s happening.</p>
<p>『Have you noticed that magazine model or something? Wasn’t she look tired lately?』</p>
<p>That was the first thing she said. Afterwards, she added other things.</p>
<p>『She’s just a <em>bitch</em> who wanted to be pampered by men.』</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>『Being beautiful is great, right?』</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>『She’s probably screwing adults anyway. She’s a pillow, a pillow.』</p>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>This Ogura spreads groundless gossip to the girls in the class. At that time, Kurumi-san had just advanced from being a model to being an actress so she’s not going to school that much and was not familiar with the people of the class. She already lost her place before she knew it.</p>
<p>All I could do was watch. My legs didn’t move, my body didn’t move, and I could only support Kurumi-san in my mind while the atmosphere changed when she’s at the class. However….as a result, she was cornered until she tried to kill herself&#8212;I was blown away.</p>
<p>And now, we arrive at the present.</p>
<p>That’s the reason I hate Ogura. Even now, I want to give her a right straight on her face with all my might. Or rather, I should. Yes, let’s do it. She’s disgusting. I stood up and tried to raise my arms&#8212;-</p>
<p>「I’m not flirting with anyone!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san shouted.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? That’s what I thought for a moment before I realized that we’re flirting in the classroom.</p>
<p>「Lunati-kun just came to me on his own, he’s a lunatic after all. There’s no way I’ll flirt with him!」</p>
<p>「That’s terrible!?」</p>
<p>「But it’s the truth, right?」</p>
<p>「No no, that’s simply not true! We were flirting with each other! We’re talking about our plans after getting married!」</p>
<p>「You’re the only one who’s doing all the flirting, not me!」</p>
<p>「You were!」</p>
<p>「I’m not!」</p>
<p>「Haa, tsundere mode again」</p>
<p>「Ah, you’re really crazy!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san screamed while holding her head. I am all aware that I’m a lunatic but I’m still shocked by being constantly told by that by the person I love. It seems like a new door has opened because of my shock.</p>
<p>「W-why are you ignoring me!」</p>
<p>While I was staring at Kurumi-san, Ogura interrupted again. I really hate this girl.</p>
<p>「Oh, you’re still here. Can you go away somewhere?」</p>
<p>「～～～～! I hate Koga but I hate you more!」</p>
<p>「That’s funny, I hate you too. Please transfer to another school right now. Otherwise, just stay home and don’t come out for the rest of your life.」</p>
<p>「You’re harder to deal with compared to Koga. And to think I have to deal with a lunatic to deal with Koga….! F*ck you, die!」</p>
<p>「Go f*ck yourself Ogura!」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>


<p>A word for a word, a curse for a curse. I cursed Ogura as she cursed me and I even stuck out my middle finger as she left us.</p>
<p>「Stop that. It’s vulgar.」</p>
<p>「As you wish!」</p>
<p>When I replied carefully, Kurumi-san sighed heavily and muttered something.</p>
<p>「Haa…..this guy, why did I think he looks so cool last time on the roof….」</p>
<p>Unfortunately, her voice was too low for me to hear anything. Whatever it is, we managed to get rid of Ogura and resumed eating.</p>
<p>When the lunch break was about to end, Kurumi-san left her seat.</p>
<p>「Where are you going?」</p>
<p>「….you shouldn’t ask girls that kind of thing.」</p>
<p>I see. So, she left to pick flowers. Kurumi-san has beauty that surpasses humanity but she’s human. There’s no way for her to oppose physiological phenomenon.</p>
<p>…..and I shouldn’t get excited about it.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about such a thing, I heard a shrill laugh. It’s from Ogura’s group. They sound like harlots. Those were some vulgar and disgusting laughs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I killed time by putting away my bento and putting my desk back until Kurumi-san returns. However, lunch break is over and Kurumi-san hasn’t returned yet.</p>
<p>It was a while after the start of the 5<sup>th</sup> class that Kurumi-san appeared in the classroom again. The door behind the classroom ratted open and she was standing there.</p>
<p>「Hey Koga, class has already star&#8212;ted 」</p>
<p>The teacher turned his head towards her and his eyes widened. That’s unusual for the normally mild-mannered teacher to change her expression so drastically but that can’t be helped.</p>
<p>&#8212;drip drip.</p>
<p>Because she was soaked from head to toe.</p>
<p>&#8212;the harlot-like laughter of Ogura made my blood boil.</p>
