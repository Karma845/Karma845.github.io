<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; A Present from My Best Friend!</h3>

<p>After waiting for Ogura’s tears to recede, we get up and head back to class.</p>
<p>「You could have gone back first, couldn’t you?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san told me that but I adamantly refused. I mean, Kurumi-san, you’ve lost all your fear of Ogura, haven&#8217;t you? I’m sure it’s a good change but I’m worried that you are too pure and might be forced to buy a jar or something in the future.</p>
<p>….well, as her husband, I have to protect her.</p>
<p>That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>「Yeah, you should have gone back earlier.」</p>
<p>Ogura said so. This girl….is she really reflecting?</p>
<p>Or rather, how much has she fallen for a fellow girl? No, well, Kurumi-san is super attractive so it’s natural….</p>
<p>I could only sigh as I tried to go after Kurumi-san, who had begun to go down the stairs first. However, I was grabbed from behind&#8212;Ogura has yet to come down and because I’m already a step down the stairs, our eyes met at the same level as I looked at her.</p>
<p>「…..what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>The serious expression on her face made me ask her seriously. Then, after taking a deep breath, she told me,</p>
<p>「Thank you. And I’m sorry.」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「That’s it. That’s all I wanted to say.」</p>
<p>While I’m stunned by her unexpected words, she went down the stairs and went to Kurumi-san. And then, she went straight to hug her arms. Kurumi-san looked puzzled but did not reject the apologetic-looking Ogura.</p>
<p>There were many things I wanted to say but I decided to say the most important first.</p>
<p>「That’s my place!!」</p>

<p>By the time I returned to the classroom, homeroom was already ongoing. As Monobe-sensei is speaking nonchalantly about the matters that need to be said. Going to the classroom like now is something I’ve never experienced before. The gazes of everyone in the room pierces me like thorns.</p>
<p>I took the initiative to enter the classroom in order to get all the attention away from the two and my gaze met Monobe-sensei’s.</p>
<p>「Hurry up and go back to your seat」</p>
<p>Apparently, he doesn’t intend to scold us now.</p>
<p>After that, homeroom went on as usual. After class, our classmates glanced at us but did not take the initiative to talk to us and went to their own after-school activities.</p>
<p>I don’t know what Kurumi-san told them but I don’t think the situation is going to improve anytime soon. That’s the way it is. That’s how human beings are.</p>
<p>I was thinking about that when I was suddenly called by someone.</p>
<p>「Yo Lunati-kun, did you have a <em>job change</em> to <em>pro escaper</em>?」</p>
<p>That someone raised his hand and spoke to me enthusiastically.</p>
<p>「Hey, I already told you that nickname isn’t good. Think about <em>compliance</em>.」</p>
<p>「Really?」</p>
<p>「Well, I take that as a compliment though.」</p>
<p>「You’re the only one who would take “Lunati” as a compliment.」</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>「So, what is that?」</p>
<p>I ask while glancing at a printout he’s holding out to me.</p>
<p>「Ah, this one? It’s my present for you.」</p>
<p>The printout he handed to me listed the members of the free activity group of the school excursion. Come to think of it, the Ogura incident occurred while we were talking about this.</p>
<p>I and Kurumi-san had been hacked off at that stage and Ogura too. I guess they already decided on the groupings so he’s giving this printout to me. However, I wonder if we’ll….</p>
<p>「…….as expected of my best friend.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>I looked down at the members&#8217; list and saw the names of me, Kurumi-san, Ogura, and Kirishima-kun. However, why did they put Kurumi-san and Ogura in the same group? Is it because they expect us to handle each of them?</p>
<p>When I asked this to Kirishima-kun, he smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>「No, it was your girlfriend who suggested that part. My name’s included in order to meet the minimum number of people.」</p>
<p>Hearing this, I looked at Kurumi-san, who was preparing to go home from her seat in the back of the classroom. My eyes met hers as she looked up to me for a moment. She immediately turned her gaze away. Cute.</p>
<p>「What are you flirting for?」</p>
<p>「I can’t help it since Kurumi-san is too cute.」</p>
<p>「Ah, yes yes. Thank.for.the.food.」</p>
<p>Waving his hand dismissively, Kirishima-kun turns away. He should be going to his club activities. His back was so handsome as he headed straight to the classroom door. He should still be handsome in the future.</p>
<p>After thinking something like that, I headed for Kurumi-san.</p>

<p>Today is Saturday, two days before the school trip.</p>
<p>Being a responsible man, I have already prepared everything I need to take with me so I’m only watching anime late at night since I’ve saved it this morning.</p>
<p>「You got a girlfriend but you’re still an otaku.」</p>
<p>「Having a girlfriend doesn’t mean I no longer care about anime.」</p>
<p>I mean, I know you watch anime behind the scenes too. I know you’ve been sneaking a peek at the anime your oniichan is watching and you already have your own favorite character.</p>
<p>「Perhaps you are bored already?」</p>
<p>「That’s not true! We’ve been flirting as hard as we can!」</p>
<p>「….in the classroom?」</p>
<p>「? Well, sort of.」</p>
<p>When I said “that’s natural” she replied “uhuh” in a low voice. That’s not the kind of voice a girl should make.</p>
<p>「How can Kurumi-san make friends if you’re like that?」</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kasumi asked me that.</p>
<p>It’s true that not many people would talk to someone if her boyfriend is all over her….</p>
<p>「Well, I wonder….there’s a girl that has been getting along with her lately.」</p>
<p>「Ah, that’s good news.」</p>
<p>「….it’s not, I mean, yes.」</p>
<p>You can’t blame me for my instinctive answer.</p>
<p>Since the incident the other day, the distance between Kurumi-san and Ogura has shrunk. Or rather, Ogura’s on her offensive. That’s right, she’s going for her. And yet, she managed to keep her distance from Kurumi-san to the extent that she’s not bothering her.</p>
<p>For example, when Kurumi-san is talking with me, she won’t really barge into our conversation and when I’m away, Ogura will talk to her. It’s like she’s an expert in reading the atmosphere and knows when and what to do. Well, it’s a good thing since it’s making Kurumi-san smile more and more….</p>
<p>But….should things go her way?</p>
<p>「Argh, I’m so frustrated.」</p>
<p>「Hee, aniki is jealous.」</p>
<p>「Maybe.」</p>
<p>However, it can’t be helped because I love her.</p>
<p>While I was discussing that with Kasumi, my smartphone started vibrating. I checked it and found it was an incoming call. When I checked the name, I saw “Koga Kurumi”.</p>
<p>In panic, I ran out of the living room and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>『…..h-hello?』</p>
<p>What came out of the phone was a voice so beautiful that it could be mistaken for the voice of an angel.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>
<p>Good face, good personality, good voice. Is she a masterpiece created by God?</p>
<p>「I love you, Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>『W-what are you saying suddenly!? M-m-maa, as expected, I’m getting used to it but…』</p>
<p>I don’t think she’s getting used to it. I can easily imagine Kurumi-san turning bright red on the phone.</p>
<p>「You’re so cute.」</p>
<p>『W-what are you saying suddenly!? Idiot!&#8230;that aside, I need to talk to you!』</p>
<p>「About our marriage?」</p>
<p>『M-mou! Right……of course not…….!』</p>
<p>After taking a deep breath, Kurumi-san continued to talk in a slightly calmer voice.</p>
<p>『Are you free tonight? If you can, can you come over to my place?』</p>
<p>My answer to this sudden invitation is obvious.</p>
<p>「With pleasure!」</p>
<p>After cheerfully replying, I went into the living room to tell Kasumi that I was leaving, got ready, and left. As I was leaving, I saw Kasumi looking at me through the living room door.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>When I asked that, Kasumi retreated back into the living room saying “Nothing”.</p>
<p>She seemed to be in the same mood as usual but the tone of her voice indicates that she was in a slightly bad mood. I wonder why.</p>
<p>「Maybe I should buy something for her on the way home.」</p>
<p>After saying that, I headed for Kurumi-san’s house.</p>
