<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; To Stop Her from Committing Suicide, I Asked Her to Have Sex </h3>

<p>On the roof of the school&#8212;across the waist high safety fence where she was standing.</p>
<p>I scream.</p>
<p>「Let’s have sex!」</p>
<p>Koga Kurumi. She has lustrous black, waist long hair and she has a beautiful mature face that it’s hard to believe she’s a high school girl.</p>
<p>Her slender yet tall figure for a girl makes it easier to understand why she’s active as a model. She has recently started acting as well.</p>
<p>Such a girl was just one step away from committing suicide. That’s why I didn’t hesitate and tell her that. A friend has been telling me “You’re a lunatic.” for a long time and it seemed that he’s right.</p>
<p>Kurumi-san moved her head like a broken mechanical doll and saw me standing behind her.</p>
<p>「P-pervert….」</p>
<p>「No, wait a minute. I’m not a pervert.」</p>
<p>「No no, that’s not true. You’re a pervert. Just now, you just asked me to have sex with you.」</p>
<p>「Because Kurumi-san, you’re about to commit suicide!?」</p>
<p>The moment I said that, she squinted her eyes.</p>
<p>「….in other words, if I’m going to die, I should have sex with you to die? I thought you were only a pervert but you turned out to be a real piece of sh*t.」</p>
<p>「That’s not it!」</p>
<p>「Then, what?」</p>
<p>「What I mean is, I want to have sex with you because I like you!」</p>
<p>「Whatever you are saying doesn’t make sense!」</p>
<p>「Why not? What’s wrong with wanting to do something erotic with someone you like! If you think it’s a sin, then all the couples in the world are guilty of such sin! 」</p>
<p>「….ah, yeah. I get it. That means you’re a lunatic.」</p>
<p>「Yeah! That’s what I mean!」</p>
<p>When I affirmed that with all my might, she was shocked and said “You actually admit it.”.</p>
<p>「A-anyway, I have no intention of having sex with you. Just get out of here.」</p>
<p>「….are you sure about that?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>When I seriously asked her, her bitter expression disappeared as she glared at me. She’s still pretty though. But personally, I like her smiling face the best.</p>
<p>「If I were to go right now, you’d probably jump off that spot. Kurumi-san, I like you, I love you with all my heart so I know you have been struggling lately. So, I know you seriously want to kill yourself 」</p>
<p>「So, you’re admitting you’re a stalker now?」</p>
<p>「No! Listen, Kurumi-san!」</p>
<p>I pointed my index finger at her and screamed as hard as I could.</p>
<p>「I’m sure that just a few moments ago, you were gazing at this beautiful sunset sentimentally thinking “This is the last view I’ll ever see” but not now! If you commit suicide now, the last person you have spoken with is a perverted, lunatic, unfamiliar boy from the same school with whom you’ve barely spoken! Are you okay with that?」</p>
<p>「…….!」</p>
<p>「I love you. I love you so much that I know you once said in a magazine interview that you love beautiful scenery. Thus, I dare you say it again! &#8212;are you sure this is how you want to end, Koga Kurumi-san!」</p>
<p>I declare so in high spirit. I’ll tell you my thoughts and the reason why I’m here.</p>
<p>After school today, she walked out of the classroom with a pensive look on her face. I was worried and even though I knew I shouldn’t have followed her, I did. That’s how I arrived at this moment.</p>
<p>I love her. Therefore, I want to stop her from committing suicide with all my heart and soul and everything, no matter what it takes. Even if she ended up hating me!</p>
<p>「W-wh…..what are you saying!」</p>
<p>「Fuhahahaha! Then get your ass back here and have sex with me!」</p>
<p>「I won’t! I’m not going have sex with you! And I’m not going back.」</p>
<p>「Fufufu, I guess your last conversation with be with a lunatic.」</p>
<p>「No no no no no no NOOOOOOOO!」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「If you don’t’ like it then get your ass back here!」</p>
<p>I reach out my hand. She looked at me with contempt. That’s quite painful but I persevere.</p>
<p>「…….so」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「Why do you want me to come back here?」</p>
<p>「? I’ve already told you. Because I like you. I’ve always liked you even before you were scouted as a model. Your appearance, your personality, everything, everything of you is in my heart. I’m already prepared to devote my life to you.」</p>
<p>「……then, are you saying that you will do anything for me?」</p>
<p>「It depends. As long as it’s within reason.」</p>
<p>When I gave my immediate answer, Kurumi-san looked surprised.</p>
<p>「Ha-haaaa! What do you mean?! You just said you’re already prepared to devote your life to me!?」</p>
<p>「Ah! Of course I am! However, I’m referring to a relation where we mutually support each other, in other words, not a one sided exploitation relationship like a slave or a servant! To put it more clearly, I refer to the relationship where we will be together “in sickness and in health”! Kurumi-san! Marry me!!」</p>
<p>「…….AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!?」</p>
<p>I never heard Kurumi-san scream like that before. Astounding&#8212;while I’m staring at her open mouth in surprise, she glared at me as if she wanted to say something earth shattering. What a cute expression.</p>
<p>「Now, choose what you will do next! Accept a proposal from a lunatic or commit suicide!」</p>
<p>「Those are the worst of both worlds!」</p>
<p>「Please accept my proposal!」</p>
<p>「No.way.in.hell!!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san is shaking her head like a spoiled child. Eventually she let out a loud sigh, turned her jittery eyes to me, and then, turned her gaze to the opposite side of the town, where sunset is already over and night has come.</p>
<p>She sighed loudly one more time then, leaps at once using her hand on the safety fence. She steps towards me, that is, towards the safe roof. That means…..</p>
<p>「Let’s build a warm home.」</p>
<p>「No, I’m not accepting your proposal!」</p>
<p>「Then, what do you mean?」</p>
<p>「…..! I just stopped killing myself.」</p>
<p>「…..I see.&#8212;&#8212;let’s have sex, then.」</p>
<p>I was relieved so I tried to ask her out again.</p>
<p>「F*ck you, you pervert!」</p>
<p>She gave my body a full blow. That punch, filled with raging emotion, had the effect of forcing me to get down on my knees and press my own face into the rooftop while at the same time, turning the gloomy expression on Kurumi-san’s face into a smile, my favorite thing in the world.</p>
<p>After glaring at me as I collapsed, she sighed once more and said.</p>
<p>「……this is the first time I’ve met someone like you.」</p>
<p>Well, if there are other guys like me, it will be bad. The Japanese police won’t be able to handle it.</p>
<p>「Should I take that as you came to like me, in other words, you’re “OK” with me?」</p>
<p>While asking for a little hope, she laughs and sticks out her peach colored tongue to me.</p>
<p>「<em>Not OK</em>!&#8230;..see you!」</p>
<p>I tried to turn and spoke to Kurumi-san’s back, who was about to leave the roof.</p>
<p>「See you tomorrow」</p>
<p>「…..hnn, tomorrow」</p>
<p>She paused for a moment and looked back. I think her face is red perhaps due to the sunset. However, it’s already getting dark.</p>
<p>「Ahh, seriously. I like you, Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>Muttering that to myself, I waited for the pain in my stomach to subside.</p>
