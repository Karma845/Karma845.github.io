<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; It Can’t Be Helped Because of Puberty! </h3>

<p>My heart aches when I admit it.</p>
<p>I like&#8212;I, Koga Kurumi, like him…..</p>
<p>「……! W-what should I do!」</p>
<p>「What do you mean?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean what do I mean….what will be my next move?」</p>
<p>W-what should I do? This is the first time I’ve fallen in love with someone so I have no idea what to do. I just feel restless and I can’t help but flap my legs around.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san, what exactly do you want to do?」</p>
<p>When she asks me, I think.</p>
<p>What should I do? According to the general public, in cases like this, the next thing to do is to confess and start a relationship.</p>
<p>Then, I thought about what would happen if I went out with him.</p>
<p>First of all, we would definitely go to and from school together every day. We would spend time together at school even at lunch. And if we could, he would stay at my place for a day or two. We would eat together at home, take a shower, sit on the couch, kiss, and then, in bed&#8212;</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san? Your face is bright red, are you okay?」</p>
<p>「Heh!? I-I’m okay!?」</p>
<p>「….what were you thinking?」</p>
<p>「E-ehto, this, ah, what if we hook up or something?」</p>
<p>I can’t say that I fantasized ending up with her older brother. Moreover, it can’t be said to be fantasizing since it already happened once.</p>
<p>「….I see.」</p>
<p>As I wondered if I had managed to fool her, Kasumi-chan lifted the corners of her lips, smiling widely.</p>
<p>「I’m surprised to find out that Kurumi-san is lewd.」</p>
<p>「～～～～! I-I’m not!」</p>
<p>「You don’t need to use excuses on me. I’m glad that I’ll be able to have a nephew or niece.」</p>
<p>Seeing Kasumi-chan grinning, I noticed that I can no longer defuse the situation so I tried to forcefully change the topic.</p>
<p>「B-but going out with him would be a bit difficult!」</p>
<p>「Why?」</p>
<p>「…..t-that….I’ll probably get addicted.」</p>
<p>「?&#8230;..so, you like making love that much?」</p>
<p>「Kasumi-chan!」</p>
<p>「Oh, excuse me. It looks like my aniki’s perversion is contagious….so, what do you mean by addicted?」</p>
<p>Kasumi-chan continues to talk as if nothing happened but I can’t hide my surprise with what she has just said. But I won’t mention it….</p>
<p>「That….I’m isolated in our class so if I go out with your oniisan….it’s probably not good.」</p>
<p>I’m alive today because of him. And I’m even going to school normally. Even so….no, that’s why I will no longer be able to leave him if we get closer than we currently are. I’ll be spoiled by him without limit.</p>
<p>「Ah, I see, I see.」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>「So, do you know what you’re saying?」</p>
<p>「…O-of course, I do!」</p>
<p>Ah, Kasumi-chan started to smile like a pervert.</p>
<p>「I mean, you already kissed, right? Isn’t it too late to say that?」</p>
<p>「Ah….」</p>
<p>「Holding hands, arms around each other, hugging, and kissing. There’s only one that’s left, right? Since you are already at that point, why don’t you just go out with him without thinking anything complicated?」</p>
<p>Hearing those words, I thought deep inside me&#8212;Kasumi-chan, there’s nothing left. I’m the biggest pervert of all.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「B-but….」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s certainly your choice what to do and I don’t think you need to decide right away.」</p>
<p>「……yeah.」</p>
<p>Kasumi-chan ended our conversation by saying “I’m always available for consultation so don’t hesitate to contact me.”.</p>
<p>If we stay any longer, there’s a possibility that their parents will come home while I’m still here so it’s time for me to leave. Frankly speaking, I think it’s common sense to say hello to them since I came to visit like this but I didn’t want to face them personally.</p>
<p>I have no problem with being mistaken for a girlfriend or something. It’s just&#8212;I had once attacked their son in his sleep so I don’t want to face them.</p>
<p>「Alright then, aniki is waiting so let’s go.」</p>
<p>「Y-yeah.」</p>
<p>Kasumi-chan took me downstairs where he was waiting for me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8212;POV Change&#8212;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p>Outside the room where the two ladies were having their conversation&#8212;or to be exact, I’m currently near the front door of our house. I’m waiting for them to come down like the loyal dog, Hachiko.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, I’m already wearing a coat and shoes. It’s not like I’ll go out to have fun somewhere. I’m only going to take Kurumi-san to the station. Because it is already dark outside, I’ll use the excuse “I’m worried” in order to spend more time with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>But still, the two of them became really good friends in just one day.</p>
<p>They must have opened the door and come out.</p>
<p>I turned my head to look at them and saw Kurumi-san being pushed back by Kasumi. She also noticed me and our gazes met for a moment&#8212;and then she averted her gaze at the speed of light.</p>
<p>「Eh? W-what!?」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s cheeks are vermillion red. What’s wrong? I looked at Kasumi, who was waiting behind her, and she was scratching her cheeks while smiling wryly.</p>
<p>「So, how should I say this…ah, I will now return you to aniki.」</p>
<p>「K-Kasumi-chan!?」</p>
<p>「I have no intention of lending her to anyone. Kurumi-san will always be mine.」</p>
<p>「I-I don’t belong to you!?」</p>
<p>「I know that. I’m just saying that Kurumi-san will always be my beloved.」</p>
<p>「Eh……..! a, au, e, ehto….」</p>
<p>This isn’t her normal reaction! Kurumi-san’s face turned bright red, she also gazed down and became fidgety. She’s even playing with her fingers. What’s with that reaction? She’s so cute.</p>
<p>「Ehto, are you okay? Are we getting married?」</p>
<p>「I-I’m fine, so….」</p>
<p>「I see. In other words, you’ll marry me.」</p>
<p>「N-no! Not yet!」</p>
<p>While maintaining her red face, Kurumi-san tightly shut her eyes and howled. She spoke instinctively but I can’t let her words slide.</p>
<p>「…..N-not yet. That means, someday, we’ll get married….right?」</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that her tongue slipped, Kurumi-san’s eyes wandered and finally stopped at Kasumi.</p>
<p>「Ah, I haven’t done my homework yet〜」</p>
<p>But Kasumi climbed the stairs and disappeared into her room. Since it’s homework, it can’t be helped.</p>
<p>「……..」</p>
<p>「……..」</p>
<p>We looked at each other and….</p>
<p>「I-I’ll walk you to the station.」</p>

<p>「….hnn, okay.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san glares at me, holds her chest, and nods in affirmation.</p>
<p>I, someone who mastered the art of not reading the mood, was still able to come up with something but it’s only a suggestion.</p>
