<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; A Beautiful Girl Descended on Our House! </h3>


<p>It’s Saturday, a few days have passed since the incident(nothing really) with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>I’ve been wandering around the house like a wanderer since morning, wandering here, wandering there, wandering everywhere. My little sister already called me a “disturbance” many times. So horrible.</p>
<p>However, it is literally inevitable for me to get carried away. After all, I have invited Kurumi-san to our house today. However, she proposed a certain condition for her to go. It was yesterday when it all happened.</p>

<p>On our way home, when the sun was about to set, I proposed something to Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「Why don’t you come over to my house tomorrow?」</p>
<p>「….w-why?」</p>
<p>「Look, the other day, didn’t I tell you I’m going to introduce my little sister to you for her to be your friend? Tomorrow’s Saturday and my little sister doesn’t have any club activities so I can introduce her to you then.」</p>
<p>「You were serious……?」</p>
<p>「Of course, as long as it’s about Kurumi-san, whether it is my words or my love, I’m serious.」</p>
<p>「…….! Ah, kuh…….!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s face blushed as she looked down. Is she being shy again? Or is it the effect of sunset? I wonder why her face always dyed red when the sun is about to set.</p>
<p>「Of course, that’s only if Kurumi-san’s not going to do anything else. Introducing you to my little sister is my way of thanking you for letting me stay at your place the other day. What do you think?」</p>
<p>「….I-I don’t have anything to do so it’s fine.」</p>
<p>「Really!? Yahoo!」</p>
<p>「You’re too happy….b-by the way, are your parents at home tomorrow?」</p>
<p>「Eeh!? A-are you planning to formally greet them!? I’m really sorry. My parents are working on Saturdays as well….」</p>
<p>「It’s not a formal greeting! It’s just that I’m worried of meeting them….a little.」</p>
<p>For some reason, Kurumi-san looks awkward. I have no idea why she’s like that.</p>
<p>「Is it because they are your future father and mother in law?」</p>
<p>「O-of course not! Anyway, they won’t be there, is that it?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, that’s right.」</p>
<p>I wonder if she really doesn’t want to meet them in person. Well, I’ll probably say no too if I’m asked if I want to meet go now and Kurumi-san’s father. Is that what she’s thinking?</p>
<p>「Then….okay. I’ll go.」</p>
<p>「I don’t know why you don’t like my parents but I think I’ll be very happy if my little sister knows that she’ll have a sister in law!」</p>
<p>「W-w-we’re not going to get married! We’re only….friends! I’m just going to visit a friend’s house???are we friends?」</p>
<p>「In my mind, you are already my wife.」</p>
<p>「In real life?」</p>
<p>「More than friends, less than lovers.」</p>
<p>「Great. You are still intelligent enough to see reality. 」</p>
<p>「Heh, so Kurumi-san thinks we are more than friends. 」</p>
<p>I felt like Kurumi-san was treating me like a fool so I tried to get back to her a little. And she lost her cool.</p>
<p>「&#8212;HEHH? Ah, no, of, not…..ugh! You sly little….!!!!」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha〜 how long will it take before I get promoted to lover?」</p>
<p>「～～～～! Y-you won’t! You won’t get promoted! Rather than being promoted, you’ll go down! I mean, demoted! Super demoted! We’ll only be last-minute friends!」</p>
<p>「But you are still going to keep me as your friend. Mou, you’re such a tsundere!」</p>
<p>「………s-shut up! You lunatic!」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「Ahahaha, sorry!」</p>
<p>「Idiot! I.D.I.O.T!」</p>
<p>She turned her face away from me and walked briskly.</p>
<p>「Hey, I’m just joking!」</p>
<p>I chased her in a hurry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p>That’s what happened. I managed to invite her and she agreed and today is the day.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that I’m nervous. I cleaned my room over and over again. Especially the trash can. I made sure it doesn’t have any tissue and I hid my pornographic books. And just to make sure, I also cleared my browsing history…..alright, everything’s ready to go!</p>
<p>「Shut up, aniki! Ah, right….you have cleaned your room. You said your friend was coming, right?」</p>
<p>My little sister looks around my room and gives me a glare.</p>
<p>「? What? I cleaned it properly.」</p>
<p>「Hnn? Ah, right, that friend.」</p>
<p>What is she saying? What on earth does she mean? As I wondered, my phone suddenly vibrated. I looked and saw that I received a message on LIME.</p>
<p>Future Bride: I’m about to arrive at the station.</p>
<p>Me: I’ll pick you up then.</p>

<p>The plan was for Kurumi-san to go to the nearest station from here and me picking her up from there. After leaving our house, I went straight to the station. I arrived at the station in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>After waiting for a while, I found her coming out of the ticket gate.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a thick <em>brown knit </em>topand black s<em>kinny</em>. The simplicity of her outfit accentuated her quality as a woman. Kurumi-san is very stylish. She’s slender, has long legs, and though not so big, she has chest too. She’s also beautiful and has a good personality.</p>
<p>「Yaay, Kurumi-san! You look great with that outfit! As expected of a <em>pro</em>!」</p>
<p>「I-is that so? Well, it’s been a long time since I’ve been praised for my outfit, so I might be feeling glad.」</p>
<p>Hiding her mouth with her cuffs, Kurumi-san smiles. It’s called moe sleeves where only her fingertips are visible. My heart is beating faster. It’s not easy to make my heart beat faster. It almost feels as if my heart is about to explode.</p>
<p>「Ugh…..!」</p>
<p>「W-what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「Ugh….Kurumi-san is too cute. I’m having a heart attack because of it&#8212;」</p>
<p>「Argh, I was worried for nothing.」</p>
<p>「Are you cold? Or are you having <em>marriage blues</em>? It seems to be one of the hardships before marriage. But fear not, I’ll definitely make you happy, Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>「Mou…..idiot. I mean, it’s cold so please bring me to your house as soon as possible.」</p>
<p>「That’s true&#8212;if you’re feeling cold, how about putting this on?」</p>
<p>I walked to the station so I don’t feel that cold. When I took off the jacket I’d been wearing and tried to put it on Kurumi-san, she stopped me.</p>
<p>「Hmmm, it’s not that far so it’s okay. Thank you.」</p>
<p>「Right? Then, let’s go!」</p>
<p>「Yes, yes.」</p>
<p>With a wry smile on her face, Kurumi-san and I started walking towards my house.</p>
<p>We were chatting while walking. Kurumi-san interrupted our conversation by saying a different subject. I listened to her half surprise and half happy since I’m usually the one who speaks.</p>
<p>「B-by the way, isn’t it almost time for the school trip?」</p>
<p>「School trip….come to think of it, I remember sensei saying something about that. It should be in Kyoto, right?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s mouth is slightly open.</p>
<p>「Are you looking forward to the school trip?」</p>
<p>She has diverted the topic so I asked her. She looked lost but after a while, she nodded and said “Hnn”.</p>
<p>「Before, I made up my mind that I won’t go. I mean, that time….how should I say it? That time, I wanted to die so I thought I shouldn’t bother&#8212;but.」</p>
<p>She cut her words and looked straight in my eyes.</p>
<p>「If you’re there….it might be fun.」</p>
<p>「….!」</p>
<p>「Ah, why do you look so embarrassed?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san grinned and poked me with her elbow. Embarrassed, ticklish, cute, ticklish, cute, cute, cute, cute.</p>
<p>「If your beloved says something like that, you’ll surely be embarrassed! I’m so happy!? We’re going to get married! We’re absolutely going to get married! I will never give you to anyone! Kurumi-san, I’ll make you happy!」</p>
<p>「&#8212;hey! Don’t just decide things one-sidedly!」</p>
<p>She’s protesting but she’s red up to her ears. Her forehead is also slightly sweaty.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san’s embarrassed too.」</p>
<p>「～～～～! S-shut up! Idiot! E-etho, idiot! Idiot idiot!」</p>

<p>She turned her back to me and didn’t speak until we arrived at our house. I don’t really mind since she looks so cute.</p>

<p>Arriving at our house, I took out my key and unlocked the door.</p>
<p>Kurumi-san is still staring at me even though we’re already here. When she passed through the front door, she said “I’ll disturb you” in a small voice. She’s very polite.</p>
<p>Then, I heard some footsteps from upstairs. It might be my little sister. I already asked her in advance that I’ll be bringing someone today and I want her to get along with her. I think she’s going down now to say hello.</p>
<p>Within a few seconds, she descended the stairs and my little sister appeared.</p>
<p>「Nice to meet you, I am aniki’s little sister, Kasumi.」</p>
<p>She’s not in her messy attitude that she usually shows me but like a cat who just went outside. I feel like her tone has also risen by one or two levels.</p>
<p>「N-nice to meet you too, I’m your oniisan’s classmate, Koga Kurumi.」</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kurumi-san was nervous. Of course, that’s normal. Kasumi is currently a 3<sup>rd</sup>-year junior high schooler which is not far from us. And the girls that oppressed Kurumi-san are not far from her age too.</p>
<p>As expected, Kurumi-san is not good with girls of this age.</p>
<p>After Kurumi-san finished her greeting, she took one step closer to me.</p>
<p>「Koga…..Kurumi…….」</p>
<p>「A-ano….is there something wrong?」</p>
<p>Kasumi puts her hand on her chin and looks at Kurumi-san. Stare, look, stare&#8212;then, she was instantly astonished.</p>
<p>「Ah? Ah! AHHHHH!!! Koga Kurumi-san, the one my aniki likes…is that you?」</p>
<p>「Yes, why?」</p>
<p>She asked so I answered immediately. However, Kasumi’s face cramped as she looked at me.</p>
<p>「Waaaaaaaaa! M-M-O-T-H-E-R! He did it! AHHHHH! Aniki finally committed a crime&#8212;! You idiot! How dare you kidnap herrrrr!」</p>
<p>「Don’t badmouth others! I didn’t kidnap anyone!」</p>
<p>「Then, how can you take a girl as beautiful as her home&#8212;-n-no way, hypnosis? Or….blackmailing!? I’ve always been telling you to not commit a crime, how can you do this!!!」</p>
<p>「I did not commit a cri&#8212;」</p>
<p>「Shut up, you beast! Rest assured, Koga-san, I’ll protect you!」</p>
<p>Kasumi stands between me and Kurumi-san like an anteater.</p>
<p>「You’re only misunderstanding usssssss!」</p>
<p>「…..fufufu」</p>
<p>I can only mourn as Kasumi bares her fangs to me. And for some reason, even though there’s an ongoing chaotic situation at the entrance of our house, Kurumi-san started laughing happily.</p>
<p>Can you at least let me take my shoes off? While thinking so, I held my head.</p>
