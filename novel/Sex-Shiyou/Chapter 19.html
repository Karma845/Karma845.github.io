<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; Person Who Destroys Atmosphere </h3>

<p>Ogura Shirabe.</p>
<p>The girl who can be said to be the main culprit in the series of bullying that led Kurumi-san to attempt suicide. In her first year of high school, Ogura slandered Kurumi-san causing her to be isolated and bullied.</p>
<p>In short, she is my grudge, my eternal enemy, and the person I hate most in the world….however, she kind of took my interest. Of course, I don’t mean it in a romantic, fraternal, or any other flirtatious way.</p>
<p>What took my interest is about her current situation.</p>
<p>In the corner of the classroom, at her seat by the window, Ogura is quietly eating her bento. There’s no one around her. Comparing her from about a week ago, the difference is similar to heaven and earth.</p>
<p>In addition, there were a few girls in the class who glanced at her and their expressions showed a hint of mockery.</p>
<p>….I called Kirishima-kun into the hallway after I finished my <em>love love lunch time</em> with Kurumi-san. I’m grateful that he’s not even showing me a bit of a sour look even though there are only a few minutes left until the next class.</p>
<p>「Kirishima-kun, Kirishima-kun. There’s something I would like to ask you about.」</p>
<p>「What do you want to ask? Ah, is it about your first girlfriend?」</p>
<p>「! How did you know!?」</p>
<p>「How can’t I? Koga’s attitude was clearly different. I honestly thought that it would only be a matter of time before you went out. However, when you started going out, it was so obvious. Anyone could tell it right away.」</p>
<p>&#8212;that makes me smile more and more.</p>
<p>Kirishima-kun chuckles as he says that. He’s as handsome as ever. I still have no idea how he became my friend but that’s not what I’m going to ask him this time.</p>
<p>「I’ll ask you about that some other time. There’s something I want to know.」</p>
<p>「Oh, to think that Lunati-kun is interested in something other than Koga….what is it?」</p>
<p>After wondering how I should start asking about it, I decided to just ask Kirishima-kun straightforwardly since there’s no point in hiding anything.</p>
<p>「Is it my fault that Ogura became like that?」</p>
<p>「No, it’s her own fault.」</p>
<p>That was an immediate answer. Then, he continued.</p>
<p>「Well, it’s true that when you startled her&#8212;&#8211;Ogura started losing her place in the class but I think it was her own fault that she became like that.」</p>
<p>「……I see.」</p>
<p>「Maa, the atmosphere in the classroom can just turn over in an instant that I find it nauseating.」</p>
<p>Kirishima-kun says that as if he’s about to throw up then, rests his elbows on the railing of the hallway, and looks at a distance.</p>
<p>There, he sees students enjoying a very normal high school life. There’s nothing strange about that. In fact, it has nothing to do with them so it’s natural.</p>
<p>But for some reason, I was bothered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p>The fifth-period class is over, the last class of the day. Normally, mathematics is a painful class for liberal arts students but today was different. The teacher standing on the podium is not the math teacher but our homeroom teacher, Monobe-sensei. As soon as the class started, he said…</p>
<p>「I will let you decide on how you’ll group yourself for the school trip.」</p>
<p>The 3 days 2 nights school trip has a scheduled free time on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day. The school trip itself is sure to be memorable but it’s not an exaggeration to say that there’s more to it than just walking around the City of Kyoto, the destination of the trip, with your good classmates.</p>
<p>In other words, it will be the first <em>page </em>on my <em>love love memory</em> with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「The number of people per group should be from four to six. It doesn’t matter if it is a mixed group or not. Once you decide, come and tell me. Any questions?&#8230;.if you can’t find any groupmates, you’ll be grouped to what’s left.」</p>
<p>No one raised their hands so the grouping began. And at the same time, I stood up. And in a straight line, I headed for the girl I love. She noticed me approaching and looked at me. Our gazes met. She averted her gaze.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san, this will be our prenuptial trip.」</p>
<p>「Wha, stop saying something embarrassing….!.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san turns her bright red face down. The cutest thing ever.</p>
<p>「The shy Kurumi-san is the cutest.」</p>
<p>「I-idiot」</p>
<p>While I was flirting with Kurumi-san like that, the students who had decided on their group went to Monobe-sensei one after another. Then, he suddenly got flustered and left the classroom after saying “I left the paper where the groupings should be written in the faculty room”.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>With the teacher gone, the noise of the class, which had already been noisy enough, became louder. I look at Ogura while conversing with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>She was floating alone amidst all the noise everyone else was making. The girls who used to be close to her stayed away and those who had nothing to do with her were more indifferent as if she’s been on the other side of a fire. Better not get involved in that. I better not care. Such atmosphere enveloped the classroom, alienating Ogura.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I hear the girls talking nearby.</p>
<p>「Look, Ogura-san is all alone.」</p>
<p>「Truly pathetic.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, but she deserves it.」</p>
<p>「Certainly…….」</p>
<p>The girls didn’t notice me and continued talking.</p>
<p>「Not really, she deserves worse.」</p>
<p>「As a high school student, you shouldn’t bully others.」</p>
<p>I was both convinced and frustrated with what they are talking about.</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>Perhaps wondering why I was silent, Kurumi-san asked me.</p>
<p>「Nothing.」</p>
<p>I shook my head and thought about my inner irritation. Why am I irritated with Ogura’s current situation?</p>
<p>I hate Ogura so much, I hate her to the bones, I want her to transfer to another school, and I even had the urge to kill her. Come on. In other words, I feel that way so I shouldn’t be irritated.</p>
<p>Thinking about it….</p>
<p>「I wonder if there’s anyone out there who’ll dare group with her.」</p>
<p>「That was a self-inflicted wound.」</p>
<p>「She’s basically a landmine.」</p>
<p>「You said you like her.」</p>
<p>「No, I don’t….」</p>
<p>「You’re joking around too much.」</p>
<p>There were only two who were talking about Ogura earlier, now it could be heard from all parts of the classroom.</p>
<p>They are all looking at Ogura in a secretive and distant way though they’re not saying anything to her directly. Pity, scorn, ridicule.</p>
<p>It was as if they were exposing her……</p>
<p>I don’t know or care what each of them actually thinks in their hearts. However, from Ogura’s point of view, who is the center of everyone’s gaze, it is easy to imagine that it is pricking her like needles.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone’s like that. In fact, there may be some who have no ill feelings toward Ogura.</p>
<p>But that’s not it. That’s not what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the classroom harbors ill feelings toward the girl named Ogura.</p>
<p>It’s the same as when Kurumi-san lost her place in the classroom…ah, that’s why I was irritated.</p>
<p>When I look at them, I think of myself when I was hesitant to help Kurumi-san just because of the atmosphere. I remember my stupid self that time!</p>
<p>The moment I understood, I stood up and tried to open my mouth&#8212;but before that, a dignified voice echoed in the classroom.</p>
<p>「Stop that!」</p>
<p>The loud voice destroys the atmosphere of the classroom&#8212;and it was a beautiful girl with long black hair.</p>
<p>Immediately after, the classroom became quiet.</p>
<p>After some time, Ogura was the first one to move.</p>
<p>As soon as she stood up, she left the classroom without her bag.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Even Kurumi-san was unable to react to her….No, no. She’s staring at me. That’s all she needs to do for me to know what she wants me to do. We’re a bakaple after all. We can communicate with just staring at each other. I’ve already had lunch.</p>
<p>I got up and left the classroom and followed Ogura.</p>
