<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Only a Man and a Woman of That Age Are in a Locked Room…..</h3>

<p>I stood up with a clatter and strode toward Ogura’s group.</p>
<p>Ah, as expected, I hate them. I hate them to the bones! I hate every one of them with all my heart! I don’t care if it’s in front of my classmates, in front of a teacher, or even if they are girls!</p>
<p>I can’t leave these guys alone after they hurt my most beloved person in the whole world.</p>
<p>「W-what are…..s-stop, don’t go near me!」</p>
<p>Ogura screamed hysterically but I didn’t stop. I can’t tolerate a dog that whines in an annoying tone.</p>
<p>「Shut your mouth. I’m going to kill you, Ogura!!!」</p>
<p>Ogura stood up noisily and took a step or two backward without looking away from me. Seeing this, I started to dash. Ogura started running too.</p>
<p>However, I’m faster. I grabbed her arm before we could get into a chase. I pulled her arm with all my strength. Ogura, who was lighter than me, was pulled towards me.</p>
<p>Given the perfect timing, I lifted my arm&#8212;and thrust my fist into Ogura’s face.</p>
<p>「Hey!」</p>
<p>&#8212;but when my fist was about to land, Kurumi-san shouted out loud. My thoughts become clear as if I was doused with cold water. Even though she was not looking at me, Kurumi-san continued talking to me.</p>
<p>「I’m, cold…」</p>
<p>「…a-ah, sorry.」</p>
<p>I let Ogura’s arm go and moved closer to Kurumi-san and put my uniform’s jacket on her. Yes, my topmost priority this time is to take care of Kurumi-san. My passion for Ogura will only last just as this situation is happening. I shouldn’t get my priorities wrong.</p>
<p>「I’m, still cold.」</p>
<p>「….then, let’s go home.」</p>
<p>「….hnn」</p>
<p>I definitely heard that she agreed. I picked up her back, took her trembling hand, and walked out of the classroom.</p>
<p>「O-oi, you guys!」</p>
<p>I could hear the teacher’s voice coming from the classroom but I had no intention of stopping.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8212;Scene Change&#8212;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-center">-0-</p>
<p>I walked hand in hand with her to the school gate. The teacher’s remarks were unexpectedly loud and the classrooms along the way looked at us&#8212;or to be more accurate, at Kurumi-san in a strange way.</p>
<p>We came to the school gate in silence and I broke it.</p>
<p>「Should I call a taxi?」</p>
<p>「….yeah.」</p>
<p>While we waited for the taxi I called, I gave her a handkerchief and had her wipe herself. If she was found to be too drenched, we might be refused of a ride.</p>
<p>After a while, we got into the taxi and realized that I hadn’t thought about where we were going. Let’s go to my house for now. Kurumi-san wouldn’t want to invite a lunatic to her house.</p>
<p>However, that thought of mind dissipated when she mentioned the address of her house. The apartment building we arrived at looked luxurious.</p>
<p>「….go in.」</p>
<p>「Are you sure?」</p>
<p>「….just this once.」</p>
<p>We passed through the entrance of the apartment building and took the elevator up. There was silence from beginning to end. I gazed blankly at the digital display showing the floor.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kurumi-san’s left-hand touches the back of my right hand. It’s just a slight touch. However, she didn’t move it away. Instead, she pressed her hand more against mine&#8212;I held it.</p>
<p>The two of us are exchanging body heat gently. I felt a little cold perhaps because mine was higher. However, it’s only at the start. After a while, our body temperatures became the same as if we melted together.</p>
<p>We continued to stay that way even after getting off the elevator, walking down the hallway, and opening the door. Only after entering that we separate from each other.</p>
<p>「…..I’m going to take a shower.」</p>
<p>No matter how much she wiped herself, she’s probably still cold. She should warm up right away. But first, I’d like to blow this nasty atmosphere away….</p>
<p>「Do you want me to scrub your back?」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「…..if you come in, I’ll hit you with the showerhead until your skull caves in.」</p>
<p>「Good, then, let’s go in together!」</p>
<p>「You lunatic….haa, I’ll be disgusted if you come in.」</p>
<p>「It can’t be helped then. I guess I can only wait for you.」</p>
<p>After seeing off Kurumi-san, who went to the bathroom for a shower, I sat on the sofa in the center of the room&#8212;in front of a giant TV.</p>
<p>I feel so restless because I’m currently in the house of the person I love, which is a dream come true but I’m doing my best to hold back.</p>
<p>Currently, Kurumi-san has no allies. I heard she lives separately from her family and she has no friends. She has temporarily stopped working as a magazine model and an actress. Given that situation, I can’t do anything that will make her feel uneasy.</p>
<p>I took my smartphone for comfort. I had left my bag at school but I found my phone in my pocket. I guess this is the nature of a modern person.</p>
<p>There was a LIME message on my phone. Upon checking, I found that it was from Kirishima-kun.</p>
<p>Kirishima: I have the things you forgot.</p>
<p>Me:Hiii….it can’t be….</p>
<p>Me: Bag-chan…Is bag-chan safe!?</p>
<p>Me: At least let me hear her voice.</p>
<p>Kirishima: Huh, okay.</p>
<p>Kirishima: 『Audio file(sound of bag being unzipped）』</p>
<p>Kirishima: If you want me to let her go safely, you have to do what I say.</p>
<p>Me: Yes….</p>
<p>Kirishima: Take care of Koga Kurumi until the end.</p>
<p>Kirishima: I’ll give her back when it’s done.</p>
<p>Kirishima: If you come to school without solving anything….</p>
<p>Kirishima: You don’t think you’ll ever see bag-chan again, do you?</p>
<p>Me: I-I understand!</p>
<p>It was almost the same time I finished my silly conversation and turned off my phone that Kurumi-san came out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>「……..! Ahh! Whoahh!!!」</p>
<p>Please forgive me for raising my voice like a lunatic. A wet-looking Kurumi-san appeared in front of me after all. Water droplets from the tip of her hair are dropping on the floor perhaps because she hasn’t wiped them with her bath towel.</p>
<p>She’s wearing a rough loungewear. A loose long-sleeved t-shirt and sweatpants. She’s an active magazine model and she never chose a sloppy dress whether it was uniform or plain clothes.</p>
<p>But now, she’s currently wearing rough clothes.</p>
<p>「Ahhh, ahhhhhhhhh, AAHHHHHHHH!」</p>
<p>「W-what!?」</p>
<p>「Wonderful! I would like to take a picture of you if that’s okay!」</p>
<p>「Not okay! I mean, you’re acting disgusting…..」</p>
<p>「But you’re so cute! It’s impossible for me to stay calm when you suddenly showed up cute even though you were always beautiful!」</p>
<p>「….haa. Coffee, cocoa, or tea, which do you prefer?」</p>
<p>Apparently, the other party doesn’t want to continue any longer. She rejected me to take her pictures and I wouldn’t go on with that topic. I straightened up and said “Coffee”.</p>
<p>After a while, my coffee arrived in a mug. Kurumi-san seems to be having cocoa. We have matching mugs. Being similar to newlyweds made me very happy.</p>
<p>「It’s like we are newlyweds.」</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>「I’m sure it would be fun, a married life with Kurumi-san. A wonderful family full of love. The neighbors will surely call us a loving couple&#8212;-」</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>「…..Kurumi-san? What’s wrong?」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Kurumi-san was silent so I called out to her. She was lost in her thoughts while staring at the mug she was holding.</p>
<p>「Somehow, I feel….tired.」</p>
<p>「……….」</p>
<p>「Why aren’t you even asking me “What’s happening?”?」</p>
<p>「I don’t have to hear anything, I know your situation.」</p>
<p>「Ah, right, you’re a stalker.」</p>
<p>「That’s a terrible way to call it…..I know because I saw it all.」</p>
<p>The current situation she’s in.</p>
<p>Isolated in class, bullied by girls&#8212;plus the stress of being a magazine model and actress. I know them all.</p>
<p>「That’s exactly why you’re a stalker….haa」</p>
<p>She gave out a long sigh and sipped her mug of cocoa all at once. She went to the kitchen with an empty mug and when she came back, she was holding a few cans.</p>
<p>「Those are alcoholic beverages. How can you drink while you’re underage?」</p>
<p>「I haven’t done it yet!&#8212;I wanted to know what they taste before I kill myself so I bought a bunch of stuff. I bought a lot more than this on the internet. I have wine, sake…」</p>
<p>「So, what are you going to do with those?」</p>
<p>I already have a rough idea but it’s important to ask.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Kurumi-san answered my question indifferently.</p>
<p>「Why don’t we drink them now?」</p>
