<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Waking Up with My Beloved! </h3>

<p>When I woke up in the morning, I noticed a strange feeling of discomfort in my body. I don’t know why this is happening but it’s not enough to interfere with my actions. However, I feel like I’ve felt this discomfort before. It is similar to when I masturbated before going to bed.</p>
<p>As expected, I won’t dare jerk off next to Kurumi-san. Perhaps I was tired because of what happened yesterday. A lot of things happened at school and after we left so it was understandable.</p>
<p>I looked next to me and saw that the bed was empty. However, the slight warmth that remained in the bed told me that someone had been there a few minutes ago. I should go up and say hello to that person.</p>
<p>「Hello, good morning!」</p>
<p>「………! Mor, ning」</p>
<p>I went to the living room and saw Kurumi-san, who was putting breakfast on the dining table. She’s still so adorable today. Her blushing cheeks are very lovely.</p>
<p>「We’ve finally spent the night together, haven’t we? I guess we have to get married now. It’s okay, I’ll be with you always, and I don’t mind if I have to wait a little longer for you.」</p>
<p>「……kuh, ah, right.」</p>
<p>「In case of emergency, I’m not afraid to drop out of school and work right now to make money.」</p>
<p>「H-hee」</p>
<p>「…..by the way, why do you look like you just bitten a bitter bug? Are you not feeling well?」</p>
<p>「N-no, that’s not the case.」</p>
<p>「No no, my <em>love sensor</em> is definitely reacting and it’s definitely correct!」</p>
<p>「What’s with that<em> sensor</em>?」</p>
<p>「It’s a super sensor that reacts violently to the changes of my beloved.」</p>
<p>「T-that’s disgusting….!」</p>
<p>「Why!?」</p>
<p>After a brief argument, I went to the bathroom to wash my face. When I came back, Kurumi-san was sitting at the dining table so I sat down opposite to her.</p>
<p>「It looks delicious.」</p>
<p>「Isn’t this normal?」</p>
<p>There was bread, salad, scrambled eggs, bacon, and coffee.</p>
<p>「No no, being normal is great. Kurumi-san will be a good wife, my wife.」</p>
<p>「W-who’s going to be your wife!?&#8230;..w-who knows if I’ll be someone else’s wife!?」</p>
<p>「Why!?」</p>
<p>「No, I mean, what are you even expecting! We’re not even dating&#8212;&#8212;-!!」</p>
<p>She stands out and screams from her seat however when her eyes met mine, she blushed and sat down. What is going on here?</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san?」</p>
<p>「….n-nothing! Itadakimasu」</p>
<p>「? Okay, itadakimasu.」</p>
<p>And so, we started eating our breakfast.</p>

<p>As we finished our breakfast, I asked Kurumi-san while drinking a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>「Come to think of it, what about school?」</p>
<p>「Can’t you tell from my outfit?」</p>
<p>What Kurumi-san is wearing is her uniform. Of course, of our school. No matter how you look at her, you’ll come to a conclusion that she’ll go to school but honestly speaking, I think it’s good that she’ll go.</p>
<p>「I was pretty violent at school yesterday….」</p>
<p>「Yes, you were.」</p>
<p>「No, well, now I’ve done it.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「You also cursed and soon after that, you started to get violent.」</p>
<p>「R-right….I’m sorry about that time. Blood just pumped into my head and I couldn’t think properly.」</p>
<p>「I-I don’t want you to apologize….I know you got angry for me. I was happy….Besides, you stayed with me in the end and that’s all that matter.」</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san…..」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san smiles.</p>
<p>「Anyway, it’s okay so let’s go to school.」</p>
<p>I’m looking at her and I find her dazzling. I’m sure I’ll never be able to get over it if the same thing happened to me. Especially if those beside me act like nothing’s happening. I will never be able to move. And I wouldn’t want to move myself.</p>
<p>And yet, she moves forward.&#8212;that’s what I like about her. That’s why I tried to whisper to her my love with all my emotions. I can still remember what she said yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8212;『Love, if you say it all the time….it becomes frivolous.』</p>
<p>Recalling her face during that time, Kurumi-san was blushing and was really cute….</p>
<p>「I love you.」</p>
<p>「Eh!? What are you suddenly!?」</p>
<p>I said it in the end.</p>
<p>「Sorry sorry, what I’m feeling leaked out. I get it. I’ll get ready so, can you wait a minute?」</p>
<p>「Y-yeah. Okay.」</p>
<p>I’ve changed into my uniform, put my phone in my pocket, and I’m ready to go. As for my bag, Kirishima-kun has it.</p>
<p>I left the apartment with Kurumi-san.</p>
