<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; My Relationship with the Beautiful Girl has Changed! </h3>

<p>We started walking again on the road leading to the station. The road, the air, the temperature, nothing has changed but in my eyes, everything seems to be fluffier than usual. The reason is simple; the change of status of my relationship with Kurumi-san, who’s walking beside me.</p>
<p>A status change from friend to lover.</p>
<p>I turn my gaze to my left arm&#8212;to be more precise, to Kurumi-san who’s embracing my left arm.</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「W-what!?」</p>
<p>There’s a blush on her face, but she’s unwilling to move away. It made me realize that the change in our relationship status is real.</p>
<p>「I think we’ve finally taken the first step.」</p>
<p>「O-of course n…..no, that, ehto……..yeah…….」</p>
<p>For a moment, Kurumi-san tried to deny it like she usually does but after looking at my face and mumbling a few words, she nodded. What is this creature, so cute.</p>
<p>Unable to contain my feelings, I hugged her. In the past, this would have been sexual harassment but now, we are lovers. This much should be allowed….</p>
<p>「Wai, don’t!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s reaction was a little different from what I had expected. However, I was not distraught at slight rejections. We are lovers after all.</p>
<p>「……w-w-w-w-w-why?」</p>
<p>I’m so distraught.</p>
<p>Why is it okay for her to hug my arms but I can’t hug her? This is worrying as much as it was shocking.</p>
<p>「W-what are you saying why? Do that when there’s only the two of us….it’s embarrassing…..」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san turned her gaze forward. When I turned my gaze forward too, I noticed that we were already at the station.</p>
<p>The station plays a central role in this area and at this time of the day, it is quite crowded. There were businessmen on their way to work on holidays, parents and children returning from a family outing, high school girls waiting for their friends, etc. and there was a lot of hustle and bustle going on.</p>
<p>「Then, what about this?」</p>
<p>I said as I pointed to my left arm, which she’s hugging.</p>
<p>「Well, it’s normal for couples to cross arms but to hug each other in public….that’s a bit….you know, right?」</p>
<p>Now that she mentioned it, that makes sense.</p>
<p>It is certainly pretty hard to see a couple hugging or kissing outside. I see. We have almost become a sample. I don’t really mind but since Kurumi-san doesn’t want to do it, I won’t force her.</p>
<p>「Okay, then, let’s be alone.」</p>
<p>「Why!?」</p>
<p>「Because I want to make out with you.」</p>
<p>「Idio……ma-maa, I understand but……」</p>
<p>Again. She was about to say “idiot” but Kurumi-san rephrased. I thought she was going to glare at me but she suddenly blushed and turned her face away in a cute way. She’s so cute that I want to watch it over and over again. If I could, I would have made a video of it and saved it forever.</p>
<p>「……..you’re on your dere period……! Alright! Then, let’s spend this night with just the two of us&#8212;」</p>
<p>「I-I’m not dere!? A-also, Kasumi is waiting for you at home so not today! 」</p>
<p>「Only today?」</p>
<p>「……..idiot!」</p>
<p>She pierced the side of my stomach. It doesn’t hurt. Rather, happiness fills my heart.</p>
<p>「Okay, if Kurumi-san says so, let’s postpone it today.」</p>
<p>「…….hmmm」</p>
<p>「You look kind of lonely.」</p>
<p>「N-no way I do!?」</p>
<p>「You’re not? That&#8217;s terrible. I want to share all of my time with Kurumi-san even a minute or a second but Kurumi-san doesn’t want to………」</p>
<p>When I blatantly showed my disappointment, Kurumi-san retracted her words.</p>
<p>「M-me too…..!」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「You too what?」</p>
<p>When I asked her about it, she looked at me with resentful eyes and continued after she had made up her mind.</p>
<p>「……..I don’t feel lonely….I really don’t.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san pouted as she muttered with a look of superiority.</p>
<p>「Therefore, endure it with this today.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san turned to me and stood up directly in front of me. She stood tiptoed to fill up our height gap and brought her mouth closer to my ears. She whispered.</p>
<p>「……..I love you.」</p>
<p>「……..!」</p>
<p>Hearing what she said, I felt like my brain seemed to be drowning. I realized that heat rises naturally on my face. Kurumi-san, on the other hand, is also blushing but she has a triumphant look on her face. So cute!</p>
<p>However, seeing her like that, I suddenly feel like retorting. So, I put my mouth closer to the ears of my girlfriend and,</p>
<p>「I love you too, Kurumi-san. I love you the most in the world.」</p>
<p>I told her that just to return the favor. Then, she hides her mouth using her sleeve and takes a step or two back.</p>
<p>「…….I-I’m leaving!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san rushed to the station ticket gate.</p>
<p>She’s in her dere period after all.</p>

<p>I, Koga Kurumi, am being rocked by the train on my way home. As I arrived at my room, I turned the lights on and went to the sofa. There, I finally relaxed my whole body.</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>I buried my face on the cushion and remembered what had just happened.</p>
<p>『Kurumi-san, please go out with me.』</p>
<p>His expression as he asked me is different from usual. His voice is serious too.</p>
<p>It’s different from when he always asks me to marry him&#8212;his expression looks exactly the same as when he helped and fought for me, he’s so cool……</p>
<p>「～～～～!」</p>
<p>My body itches and I flap my legs. I hug the cushion tightly.</p>
<p>What should I do&#8230;&#8230;what should I do, what should I do!</p>
<p>I flapped and rolled on the sofa. I know this is bad manners. I know I’m being immodest. But I can’t control it……</p>
<p>「…..I’m in love….love, love………」</p>
<p>Putting it in words is so embarrassing. However, my heart is getting warmer and warmer. The more I say it, the more the feelings build up. Now, I think I understand why he always tells his love to me.</p>
<p>When we were about to leave each other, I whispered “I love you” to him. Just remembering it makes me embarrassed but I also want to say it more.</p>
<p>If you realize it, you won’t be able to stop.</p>
<p>I wish it would be Monday soon.</p>
<p>I can’t stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>I want to go to school with him. I want to go to school while holding hands. It’s embarrassing outside but I want him to hug me when we’re alone. I want to kiss him while saying “I love you” to him. And while he’s still conscious……</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>This is bad, I’m so horny. My body’s tingling.</p>
<p>Now that we are lovers, I fantasize about kissing and having sex and it made me so horny. But it can’t be helped. It was my first time to have a boyfriend and the last conversation I had with him was an invitation to have sex as lovers.</p>
<p>At that time, I held back but if I had….if I had accepted his offer, we would have…..</p>
<p>「…….」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>I sit down on the couch, take off the coat I borrowed from him, and look at it. I put my nose close to it and sniffed it. I could smell him. Of course?</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m a pervert. No, I attacked him when he was sleeping so it’s already too late to conclude that. I buried my face on his coat, hugged it, and reached my lower abdomen using my right hand&#8212;</p>
