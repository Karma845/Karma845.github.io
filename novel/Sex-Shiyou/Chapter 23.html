<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Invitation from a Beautiful Girl! </h3>

<p>If you’re free today, why don’t you come to my house?</p>
<p>No man would not be excited from hearing such a wonderful line from the love of his life. The tension is soaring as well.</p>
<p>I jumped on the train and headed to her house.</p>
<p>I pushed the intercom and she appeared right away.</p>
<p>「You’re fast.」</p>
<p>「If Kurumi-san called me, I would run to you even if I had to cross a sea of fire or go in some unexplored part of China.」</p>
<p>「Y-you don’t have to go that far…..come in.」</p>
<p>And so, I went inside.</p>
<p>Then, there’s a suitcase in the living room.</p>
<p>Clothes are scattered around it. I guessed it was for the school trip.</p>
<p>The school trip was for 3 days and two nights and except for the first day, the students could wear plain clothes.</p>
<p>In other words, it means I’ll be traveling with Kurumi-san in plain clothes.</p>
<p>「How’s the preparation for our honeymoon?」</p>
<p>「I-it’s not our honeymoon!」</p>
<p>「Where do you want us to go then?」</p>
<p>「I guess….Hawaii?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san glanced at a magazine on the glass table while muttering.</p>
<p>As I approached, I found that it was a travel magazine. For Hawaii.</p>
<p>「T-that’s」</p>
<p>In panic, she snatches the magazine and hides it behind her back.</p>
<p>「What’s that?」</p>
<p>「N-nothing.」</p>
<p>「Nothing?」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「Come to think of it, when I asked you where we should go, you seemed to answer rather readily…..」</p>
<p>Pretending to be a great detective, I put my hand on my chin and glanced around.</p>
<p>If I had been wearing glasses, it would have lit up.</p>
<p>「…..ugh….I did not! I-I only thought of it! There’s no deeper meaning or anything!」</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san…..!」</p>
<p>「I told you there’s no deeper meaning!?」</p>
<p>「You don’t have to be shy…..I know all about it.」</p>
<p>「……i-idiot!」</p>
<p>When I told her that, her face turned red, she turned around, and moved to the kitchen.</p>

<p>A clinking sound can be heard from the kitchen.</p>
<p>She’s probably preparing drinks.</p>
<p>I can’t help but feel her love as she prepares drinks for me after calling me an idiot.</p>
<p>While I was feeling very moved, I looked around the room and realized something.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>There are more things here compared to when I visited before.</p>
<p>Before, the room had been bleak and lifeless, creating a lonely atmosphere that made it seem as if there is no intention of living in this place but now, it’s different.</p>
<p>There’s a houseplant by the window and cute accessories lined up in the corner of the table. Next to the large-screen TV is a Marimo Kart game that Kasumi and I used to play together at my house.</p>
<p>I wonder if she got hooked on it or is she practicing for her next visit.</p>
<p>….either way, I feel irresistibly happy…..</p>
<p>So, when I visited before, it felt modern and fashionable but now, it feels more like a girl’s house making me a bit nervous.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, what did Kurumi-san want?</p>
<p>She called me up here and said she wanted to talk to me but I still haven’t heard what she wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>If it was about our honeymoon, I would be more than happy but I’m sure it’s not.</p>
<p>Just as I’m thinking about it, Kurumi-san comes back to me.</p>
<p>「Here」</p>
<p>「Thanks」</p>
<p>After putting down the coffee and cocoa on the table, Kurumi-san sits down next to me.</p>
<p>She was walking toward the kitchen while pouting earlier but now, our distance was quite close.</p>
<p>The room was heated and warm. Perhaps because of this, Kurumi-san is dressed even more casually than usual.</p>
<p>She was wearing a large shirt and black skinnies underneath. At first glance, there is not a hint of sexiness or fashion in this outfit. However, that’s not the case.</p>
<p>「….taste great」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san takes a small sip of cocoa and puts her mug on the table.</p>
<p>As she does so, she leans forward slightly, almost revealing something she is not supposed to from her large slack neck.</p>
<p>I stared at her face and wondered if this was an invitation.</p>

<p>「W-what?」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「I-is there something on my face?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san took her phone and used the camera app to check her face. Cute.</p>
<p>Apparently, she found that it was just her normal face.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san」</p>
<p>「What? You’ve been like that since earlier.」</p>
<p>「Don’t ever dress like that except in front of me.」</p>
<p>「Ehto…..?」</p>
<p>「Please promise me.」</p>
<p>I’m telling her that seriously. Kurumi-san said “too close” and moved away a little.</p>
<p>Oh, I’m being rude. I was so eager that I moved my face too close to hers.</p>
<p>「Well, I don’t know why you don’t want me to but….since you don’t want me to dress up like this in front of anyone else….or rather, I only dressed up like this because it’s you.」</p>
<p>「D-does that mean that Kurumi-san treats me as someone you can let your guard down with!?」</p>
<p>For me, it’s a way of saying “I love you” or “will you marry me” and even “I want to bear your child”.</p>
<p>After pausing for a moment, she nodded and looked a little puzzled.</p>
<p>「Y-yeah, that’s right.」</p>
<p>「…..I-I see.」</p>
<p>I feel somewhat relieved and then&#8212;I realized. Kurumi-san’s face is right in front of me. It’s just a stone away from my eyes and nose.</p>
<p>It looks like I’ve become too excited that I had pushed her down on the sofa.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>Her shirt flipped up from the momentary force giving me a glimpse of her cute navel.</p>
<p>When I looked up, my eyes met with Kurumi-san, who was staring at me.</p>
<p>「P-pervert.」</p>
<p>「N-no, I’ll only look.」</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>Silence dominates the place.</p>
<p>Kurumi-san stares at me, her lips are trembling.</p>
<p>Her slightly sweaty neck, disheveled hair, flustered cheeks, and moist eyes.</p>
<p>That’s simply irresistibly stimulating my rationality.</p>
<p>I tried to desperately suppress the urge to attack her in order to not hurt her and tried to get up&#8212;</p>
<p>「…..hnnn」</p>
<p>Under my arms, Kurumi-san’s eyes are tightly closed but she lifted her chin.</p>
<p>「May I?」</p>
<p>I ask but there’s no answer. Instead, Kurumi-san nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The moment I saw that, I took her lips.</p>
<p>I was drunk before.</p>
<p>I haven’t kissed her since then&#8212;or rather, thinking back, this is the first time I have kissed her like this. The soft feeling is so comfortable that it seems to melt my brain that I don’t want to stop forever.</p>
<p>When I put my hand on her shoulder, she trembled slightly.</p>
<p>However, there’s no sign of resistance, or rather, she pressed her lips more to mine.</p>
<p>「Hmmm….fuh, hmmmm」</p>
<p>I can hear a sweet voice.</p>
<p>Then, Kurumi-san’s tongue came in&#8212;toot! Toot! Toot!</p>
<p>「「………..!?」」</p>
<p>A loud sound rang from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Startled, she stopped kissing me and told me “excuse me” while covering her mouth and heading for the kitchen.</p>
<p>I also went into the kitchen after calming my racing heart. I wonder if this racing heartbeat is excitement or nervousness….or probably just surprised because of the alarm.</p>
<p>「What’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「No, I mean…..what can I say?」</p>
<p>When I arrived at that kitchen, I found Kurumi-san there, taking an iron plate out of the oven. On the iron plate are slightly burnt cookies.</p>
<p>Could it be that this is the reason she called me today?</p>
<p>If so, I’m very happy. I have a question though.</p>
<p>「I asked you to come today because I wanted you to try these….」</p>
<p>「That’s a very nice idea but….we’re going on a school trip the day after tomorrow, right?」</p>
<p>Not many people would bake cookies and call their boyfriends in anticipation of a trip. While I’m thinking of that, Kurumi-san scratched her cheeks as if she was feeling bad about it.</p>
<p>「Well, you know, before a test, don’t you enjoy cleaning?」</p>
<p>「I do.」</p>
<p>「As for me, when I was thinking about which clothes should I wear for the school trip, I kind of wanted to cook.」</p>
<p>「…..I see.」</p>
<p>Perhaps Kurumi-san is one of those types that put off troublesome things until later. Especially when it comes to her own affairs. I’ve come to know an unexpected side of her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「I’m sorry, it’s burnt.」</p>
<p>「No, problem. Let me eat them.」</p>
<p>「Y-you don’t have to force yourself to do it.」</p>
<p>「I’m not forcing myself.」</p>
<p>I transferred the cookies to a plate and took them to the table. Then, while turning on the console that was next to the TV, I announced to Kurumi-san, who just came in.</p>
<p>「I think I want to eat the cookies that Kurumi-san made and play games with you from the bottom of my heart.」</p>
<p>「….idiot.」</p>
<p>In the end, we never got into that kind of mood after spending the rest of the day playing games.</p>

<p>And the next day, Sunday.</p>
<p>After finishing my final check on my luggage, I went to bed early to avoid oversleeping.</p>
<p>Kasumi made fun of me saying, “You’re not an elementary schooler”. However, I can’t help it since I’ll be traveling with Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m confident that I’m more excited now compared to when I was in elementary school.</p>
<p>In any case, the school trip will start tomorrow.</p>
<p>I hope to have a lot of fun.</p>
