<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Sleepover with a Beautiful Girl! </h3>


<p>「I-I-I won’t!」</p>
<p>When I woke up from my sleep, I found Kurumi-san’s cute face so I kissed her but she resisted and rejected me very hard.</p>
<p>「W-why!?」</p>
<p>「What do you mean by why…? Because I don’t want to!」</p>
<p>「But Kurumi-san, you kissed me earlier!」</p>
<p>「Kuh…that’s because I was drunk….」</p>
<p>「Ugh….you mean that was just a playing-around kiss?」</p>
<p>「Why are you telling me that as if I’m a scumbag…!?」</p>
<p>「You’re terrible, you slipped your tongue in….that was my first kiss….」</p>
<p>「I didn’t do that?!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san can’t seem to look at me straight.</p>
<p>「You sure did! You licked my mouth all over! I felt like it was full of love and affection and you look so cute!? It’s a crime! It’s felony! You should be imprisoned next to me for life!」</p>
<p>「W-what do you mean by I licked you all over? Don’t use disgusting words!」</p>
<p>「So, you’re not denying that it was full of love and affection?」</p>
<p>「Kuh….well, I-I don’t hate it…..」</p>
<p>「In other words, you like it, don’t you?」</p>
<p>「I.do.not!」</p>
<p>「Really? Are you sure that’s what you really think, Kurumi-san?」</p>
<p>「Eh?&#8230;..th-that is.」</p>
<p>「If you don’t, let’s try kissing again. Maybe you’ll understand after. You’ll notice that you love me too. After that, let’s not waste more words. Let’s immediately make that love grow!」</p>
<p>「You lunatic! I won’t do it! I don’t love you!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s face turns red as she says “Ugh” while shaking her head. I wonder if she’s angry. She must be. Her face is red.</p>
<p>「Haa…good grief. What a troublesome girl.」</p>
<p>「…..tsk.」</p>
<p>「Eh…..did you just click your tongue just now? We were having a pretty flirtatious lover’s quarrel but you instantly went into dislike mode!」</p>
<p>「I don’t like it when you say everything out loud like that!」</p>
<p>「I…」</p>
<p>「….you what?」</p>
<p>「Love you.」</p>
<p>「W-what are you saying!?」</p>
<p>「I love you.」</p>
<p>「I just told you to not say something disgusting. Telling you love me is disgusting too!」</p>
<p>Kurumi continued “that’s in addition to what I said earlier” and looked at me, then looked at the other side, then looked at me again, as she blushed more and more.</p>
<p>「Telling me you love me everytime is…frivolous.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san sticks out her lips. She’s definitely sulking.</p>
<p>「….ano, will you marry me?」</p>
<p>「….are you really asking me that?」</p>
<p>「And what do you expect me to say!? You are too cute! Why are you so cute!?」</p>
<p>I stick to Kurumi-san. Then, she slightly raised her blushing cheeks and glared at me. Yeah, <em>cute</em>!</p>
<p>「&#8212;by the way, did you call home?」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「Ahh, it hurts that you just blatantly change the topic….come to think of it, I didn’t….」</p>
<p>I unlocked my phone and saw that I had five missed calls from my little sister. The time was after we had started drinking. Let’s send her a message. I typed “I’m staying at a friend’s house today.”.</p>
<p>「Heh….a decent email. Or are you only becoming a lunatic because of me?」</p>
<p>「I’m in a runaway express for love. It is inevitable that I get excited in front of Kurumi-san. If you consider that as a lunatic, I guess I am.」</p>
<p>「Ah, yes yes. You’re still the same Lunati-kun.」</p>
<p>「You’re cruel.」</p>
<p>As I grumbled, she sighed in exasperation and pointed to somewhere in the room. I’m pretty sure she’s pointing at her bathroom.</p>
<p>「You want me to go there with you?」</p>
<p>「You go in, I’m not.」</p>
<p>「Let’s go in together.」</p>
<p>「N.O!」</p>
<p>Being refused is something that can’t be helped.</p>
<p>「Ah…right. I’m going to wash my body using the bathroom that Kurumi-san always uses.」</p>
<p>「………」</p>
<p>「What’s the matter?」</p>
<p>「…..no, well, you’re right but I just suddenly felt you are bursting with creepiness.」</p>
<p>「It’s okay. I’ll just look at your underwear in the washing machine. I won’t touch the towel that Kurumi-san uses to wash your body nor the sponge you use to scrub yourself.」</p>
<p>「It’s not okay!? D-don’t you dare move there!」</p>
<p>She went towards the bathroom and opened the door with tremendous power. After that, she made a big fuss in it. It’s a pity since I am super interested in Kurumi-san’s underwear. As she said, I stayed where I was. Haah.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, she returned blushing and gasping. She told me “Go ahead” to which I replied “Thanks” and took a shower.</p>

<p>「Sleep on the couch.」</p>
<p>That was the first thing Kurumi-san said when I went out of the bathroom. By the way, I borrowed Kurumi-san’s father’s pajamas.</p>
<p>She offered me a cut of cold tea and pointed to the sofa in the living room.</p>
<p>「…..」</p>
<p>I sipped the tea and gave her a protesting look.</p>
<p>「What’s with your dissatisfied face?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s November, the nights are cold. If I sleep on the sofa, there’s a high chance that I’ll catch a cold. On the other hand, if we slept in the same bed, not only the blanket would keep us warm but our body heat would also help each other. Two birds in one stone! That being said, I’d like to sleep in the same bed as you!」</p>
<p>「No, you can’t. You’ll do something weird to me and I only have a single bed in my room.」</p>
<p>「……! No problem then! We just need to stick together to sleep and everything will be solved!」</p>
<p>「That won’t solve anything! Haa」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san gave out a long sigh, knitted her eyebrows, and groaned after hearing my unexpected answer.</p>
<p>「…..a-are you going to lay your hand on me?」</p>
<p>「If Kurumi-san wants to, I’ll do it. I love you, Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>「…..have you drank your tea?」</p>
<p>「? Yeah.」</p>
<p>I don’t get why did she even asked me that but I showed her my empty cup. After that, she exhaled heavily and said….</p>
<p>「…..okay, just this once.」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「! Hell yyeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!」</p>
<p>「You’re too happy!」</p>
<p>「Of course, I am! I’ll be with my beloved! If you’re a man, you’ll surely be excited unless you’re not a man! And guess what, I’m a man! That means I’m happy!」</p>
<p>「….haa, maa, since he drank it, it should be okay…..」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san murmured something and began to prepare to go to bed. I’m not sure what to do but I followed behind her. She lent me a spare toothbrush and finished my preparations.</p>
<p>「Now, let’s go to the bedroom!」</p>
<p>「……yeah.」</p>
<p>I let out a sigh and walked towards the bedroom. Her bedroom was simple but had a sense of life and above all, it was stylish.</p>
<p>Kurumi-san was the first one to go to bed and I went next to her, sideways. Kurumi-san’s smell fills my nasal cavity and a vivid warmth is transmitted to my body. Even if I die here right now, I have no regrets. I’m satisfied enough to think of that.</p>
<p>The bed was so small that our hands, feet, and hips could touch with the slightest movement. I wish we could sleep facing each other but there’s no way we could stand it if we do that so we turn our backs with each other.</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>The only sound at that time was the ticking sound of the second hand of the clock. And it stays that way for a while. Suddenly, I felt very sleepy. Perhaps it’s because I’m so relieved with being the person I love. I want to enjoy this taste of heaven as long as possible but….I’m almost at my limit.</p>
<p>「Hey」</p>
<p>「….hnn?」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>「…….」</p>
<p>I felt like someone talked to me but I wondered if it was just my imagination. I’m very sleepy. I’m not sure. I’d like to enjoy my bedtime with Kurumi-san…….more……</p>
<p>And just before my consciousness was cut off, I felt that Kurumi-san muttered something again. However, I can no longer hear anything.</p>
<p>What on earth did she say? I felt sorry for her but I couldn’t fight my sleepiness so I fully let my consciousness go.</p>
<p>『….hey, do you want to have sex?』</p>
<p>I missed hearing such important words&#8212;</p>
