<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; W&#x2d;Wait a Minute! </h3>


<p>As I stepped out into the hallway, I saw the back of Ogura running off toward the stairs. I don’t know where she is headed but I can’t just leave her be. Given the situation, anything could happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, for example&#8212;something that Kurumi-san did.</p>
<p>I moved faster to catch up with her.</p>
<p>As I rush toward the stairs, I hear footsteps ascending to the upper floor and footsteps coming up from below. The former, moving away from me, was no doubt, Ogura. However, I turned my head to the latter first.</p>
<p>Then, I saw the person I had expected to see, coming up the stairs.</p>
<p>「Hnn? What’s going on?」</p>
<p>It was Monobe-sensei, holding a clear envelope with printouts in one hand and a question mark in the other.</p>
<p>「Kurumi-san is currently working hard so it would be helpful if you could watch the situation first before entering the classroom.」</p>
<p>「Watch first? Eh? What&#8212;」</p>
<p>「I’ll take my leave now.」</p>
<p>「Haa!? O-oi!」</p>
<p>Feeling sorry for Monobe-sensei, I turned my back on him and headed to the upper floor. As I climbed the stairs step by step, I remembered something unpleasant. A few weeks ago, I had followed Kurumi-san to the rooftop after seeing her in an abnormal state.</p>
<p>I gritted my teeth.</p>
<p>Why has the situation advanced to the worst? I just want to make Kurumi-san happy….no, everyone should be happy. That dreadful atmosphere must be erased.</p>
<p>I went upstairs, past the 3<sup>rd</sup> floor, to the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. There are no classrooms on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor. There is only a vending machine and a door leading to the rooftop. I grab the doorknob and turn it.</p>
<p>Ogura’s there.</p>
<p>On the safety fence where Kurumi-san was.</p>
<p>She looked so surprised with both of her elbows resting on the safety fence.</p>
<p>As I was about to step on the rooftop, I suddenly heard her murmuring.</p>
<p>「What’s with that…」</p>
<p>By “that”, I assume she was referring to the way Kurumi-san defended her from our classmates. Needless to say, she was so cool that I unexpectedly fell in love with her all over again.</p>
<p>Ogura mumbled. She curled her back and her shoulders shook.</p>
<p>I wish she would stop the movement of “someone being emotional” given the location. I decided to call and convince her to go back and stepped onto the rooftop.</p>
<p>「That’s…….soooo coooollllll……」</p>
<p>Those words and more hit my ears.</p>
<p>….what in the world is she saying? I mean, I could somewhat recognize them but I can’t understand. NO, that’s a lie. I do understand. Wait a minute.</p>
<p>「O-Ogura?」</p>
<p>I wanted to speak to Ogura as resolutely as possible but even that thought was thrown into the water. The words that I threw at her were full of agitation, pitiful, and were more of a trembling sound wave.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that it had arrived to Ogura. She was so surprised that she looked like a cat that had its tail stepped on as she looked back.</p>
<p>That expression is….ah, what is it? Her face is bright red and her eyes are even teary. She opened her mouth, distorting her surprised expression and looked around.</p>
<p>「…..d-did you hear that?」</p>
<p>「If you are talking about your rival declaration to me, I heard it all…however, aren’t you bullying Kurumi-san because you hated her?」</p>
<p>I replied truthfully as there’s no point in misinterpreting what’s going on. Ogura bit down her lower lip and closed her eyes for a few seconds. She took a deep breath in and exhaled loudly.</p>
<p>「I-it can’t be helped! Sh-she’s too guarded by everyone…..!」</p>
<p>When Ogura said that, I felt she had no ill will toward Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「Then, why did you run out of the classroom?」</p>
<p>I had assumed that she would jump off because she couldn’t stand it any longer.</p>
<p>She had bullied Kurumi-san in the past and as a result, she’s being blamed for it, and is being ostracized by the whole class. Even so, Kurumi-san still stands up for her. From Ogura’s POV, that should be nothing but humiliation.</p>
<p>I thought that was the reason she had run out of the classroom.</p>
<p>However, this girl in front of me now, after hesitating for a moment, clutched her bangs and answered in a mosquito-like voice.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>


<p>「….I don’t want anyone to see my embarrassed face….」</p>
<p>Is this really Ogura? I felt like she was a different person.</p>
<p>「A-ahhh, I see.」</p>
<p>My brain overheated by the unexpected chain of events.</p>
<p>It was as if I had been lied to after thinking that the atmosphere was going to be quite serious.</p>
<p>But, well, that’s surprising…isn’t it? Thinking about it, that’s a natural reaction. When I was bullied in the past, I was saved by Kurumi-san and since then, I’ve been crazy about her.</p>
<p>I guess it was Ogura’s turn.</p>
<p>「…….I want to apologize to Koga.」</p>
<p>「Yeah, that is a good idea.」</p>
<p>「And, after that….I want to be her friend or something.」</p>
<p>「That is a good idea.」</p>
<p>「…..you’re not angry?」</p>
<p>「Why would I?」</p>
<p>When she heard my reply, she looked down.</p>
<p>「Because….that’s too convenient…….」</p>
<p>「I’m not a fan of the word convenient. I would call it “opportunity”. You’re going to do that because you were given the opportunity to do so and not because it was for convenience&#8217;s sake.」</p>
<p>「….Is that so?」</p>
<p>「Yeah.」</p>
<p>「….so, how about more than friends then?」</p>
<p>Those words stunned me for a moment. I wonder if the “more than friends” she means was being best friends or being my rival. Looking at Ogura’s expression as she speaks in a whisper-like voice as she’s playing with her fingers, it looks like the latter…..</p>
<p>「……….」</p>
<p>「…..ehto」</p>
<p>「That’s is, what do you mean, is that what you mean, that is. How about you think about it after you became friends?」</p>
<p>I was hesitant to say something that I didn’t even know what I was saying.</p>
<p>I was nervous inside. There was a reason for it.</p>
<p>I love Kurumi-san. I love her more than anyone else in the world and of course, I intend to marry her in the future. And she likes me in her own way too. However, that’s not the problem.</p>
<p>I know about “that”. I know it because I love her more than anyone else in the world.</p>
<p>&#8212;I know that she has a friendly view of love between LGBT.</p>
<p>To put it simply, she’s a girl who can also like a girl.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ogura is bad news. She’s much better than a poor boy like me. She’s beautiful after all.</p>
<p>I glanced at the blonde in front of me. She smiled though she had a slight shadow on her face.</p>
<p>「….Right.」</p>
<p>「Ah, yeah.」</p>
<p>Seeing Ogura looking convinced, I exhaled a breath of relief and approached her.</p>
<p>「Anyway, let’s go back to class.」</p>
<p>「…..b-but」</p>
<p>「It’s okay. Kurumi-san stood up for you.」</p>
<p>「!&#8230;..hmmm, yeah.」</p>
<p>In any case, I guess that settles the matter. Ogura moved away from the fence and came closer to me&#8212;and then, she stumbled. Given the surprised look on her face, she must have simply stumbled. Since there wasn’t that much distance between us, I reached out and supported her shoulder.</p>
<p>Ogura stood up at once as if her center of gravity had not shifted that much.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「T-thank you.」</p>
<p>「No, it’s fine.」</p>
<p>As I was about to let Ogura go, I suddenly heard the door open behind me. When Ogura and I looked at it, we saw the person we both love&#8212;Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「Ah, Kurumi-sa&#8212;」</p>
<p>Perhaps she came to check on me. I was so happy that I tried to call out her name.</p>
<p>「Y-you cheater!?」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
