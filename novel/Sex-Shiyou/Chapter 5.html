<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; A Bewitching Night with a Beautiful Girl!</h3>

<p>I hesitated for a moment before answering her question. Perhaps it is due to a little bit of common sense left in me. Minors are not allowed to drink alcohol. That’s common sense. However, Kurumi-san nonchalantly invited me to break that rule.</p>
<p>&#8212;this was not your usual Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>Apart from that, a minor won’t be criticized for drinking alcohol at home as long as they don’t get caught. However, Koga Kurumi is a girl who dislikes any act of disobeying rules so she wouldn’t think that it’s fine as long as we won’t get caught.</p>
<p>However, she said let’s drink as if she doesn’t care about common sense.</p>
<p>She’s acting like me….so that’s what it is.</p>
<p>This is the first time I realized that. In fact, I’m now wondering why I hadn’t noticed it before.</p>
<p>&#8212;in the first place, there’s no way a girl who tried to kill herself was not crazy.</p>
<p>In other words, to put it simply, Kurumi-san is sick…..</p>
<p>「Alright, let’s drink then! By the way, this will be the first time I’ll drink alcohol too!」</p>
<p>However, my motivation is clearly different from hers. I only want to drink because I’ll be drinking with Kurumi-san. More specifically, I want to see a drunk Kurumi-san!&#8230;.isn’t this some kind of ulterior motive?</p>
<p>「……really?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s no exaggeration to say that I’m a good citizen representative of all high school boys. I have never thought of doing something evil like drinking!」</p>
<p>「You’re lying….」</p>
<p>「It’s true, I’m not lying. I’ve never drunk before!」</p>
<p>「….then, are you going to put all the blame on me? The one who invited you to drink?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s eyes look uneasy. I want to hug you right now but I have to hold back and blow away that anxiety first. I want you to smile. That anxious look doesn’t suit you at all.</p>
<p>「No way! I’m fortunate to have your first time, Kurumi-san! After drinking alcohol, what comes next is decided. So, let’s have a toast….! Let’s do it right away!」</p>
<p>「P-pervert! I won’t do it!? I won’t get drunk!」</p>
<p>「Fufufu, that is something we have to think about later, right?」</p>
<p>「Uwaa. That laugh is very disgusting. As expected of Lunati-kun.」</p>
<p>「Don’t call me that!」</p>
<p>After some hesitation, Kurumi-san picked up a strong shochuhai and I chose a can of beer. We both pull the tabs at the same time and bump the cans with each other.</p>
<p>「Cheers!」</p>
<p>「Ah, cheers. And sorry but, I’m probably not going to get drunk.」</p>

<p>「Ahhhh, I can’t take it anymoreeeee. Why do I have to get bullieeddd!!」</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we started drinking. It was getting dark outside the window. When I looked at the clock to check the time, I saw that there were a total of four long and shorthands.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze away from the clock and looked at Kurumi-san, who was playing with the bottle of sake in her hand.</p>
<p>Her hair was a mess, her cheeks were flushed, and the distance between us was enough for me to feel her body heat.</p>
<p>「I agree! Why does Kurumi-san have to be bullied! I’m so angry!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, Lunati-kun really knows everything about me! As expected of my stalker」</p>
<p>「I’m not a stalker! It’s love!」</p>
<p>「Love?&#8230;..do you love me?」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san puts her index finger on her lips and asks me if I love her. My heart is already melting with that alone.</p>
<p>「I looooooooovvvvvvvveeeeeeee you!」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha, you’re drunk!」</p>
<p>「You too, Kurumi-san. You smell like alcohol! <em>Sniff sniff</em>, haaa haaa」</p>
<p>「Ufufufu, are you getting excited by my smell?」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>


<p>「Yes! I’m so excited! So let’s have sex!」</p>
<p>「Ehhhh, but, hey, okay」</p>
<p>「Eh!? Are you sure!? Am I really going to get this chance!?」</p>
<p>「Maa, I can feel that you really like me〜. However, we haven’t been talking for very long〜 and this is embarrassing but, I’m still a virgin〜.」</p>
<p>「!? Y-yo-you&#8217;re a virgin!?」</p>
<p>「You didn’t know? Aren’t you my s-tal-ker?」</p>
<p>「I didn’t know.」</p>
<p>「Are you happy?」</p>
<p>「Happy!」</p>
<p>「Fuuuhn」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san grinned and shortened the distance between the two of us. Although we were originally quite close, we became closer that our bodies stick closely. I mean, I’ve been holding her hand since a while ago and it was a lover-like hand-holding where our fingers are tangled with each other’s hands.</p>
<p>Seeing I’m nervous, she smiles seductively and whispers in my ear.</p>
<p>「Do you want to?」</p>
<p>「…..! I do! But, are you sure?」</p>
<p>「Hmm, perhaps I do, I wonder….hnn, maa, you helped me….」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san glanced at me sideways. She said “okay” and stood up enthusiastically while our thighs rubbed with each other. When I was wondering what happened for her to suddenly leave, Kurumi-san rode my thigh while facing me.</p>
<p>「…..!」</p>
<p>I feel her soft thigh and see her beauty right in front of me. I couldn’t help but swallow my saliva.</p>
<p>「Do you love me?」</p>
<p>「I love you.」</p>
<p>「More than anyone in the world?」</p>
<p>「Of course」</p>
<p>「ufufufu….then, look into my eyes.」</p>
<p>I stare into Kurumi-san’s eyes. Of course, it’s not an exaggeration to say that it’s a miracle that I’m still able to keep reason.</p>
<p>「Tell me you love me again.」</p>
<p>「Eh?」</p>
<p>「You can’t?」</p>
<p>「I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you」</p>
<p>There is no shame in declaring your love. This is something that no one should hesitate to do.</p>
<p>The next moment, my mouth was covered with something soft. It was Kurumi-san’s lips….as I was surprised by the sudden event, something slimy split my lips and invaded my mouth.</p>
<p>「………hmmmm,fuuuu, hmmm….na………ea♡」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s snorting, breathing, and panting melted my brain. It is one hell of a drug.</p>
<p>As her scent begins to take over me, she pulls her lips away.</p>
<p>「I like the word “love” and a kiss will be a good way to fully prove it.」</p>
<p>「……K-Kurumi-san!」</p>
<p>I was at the edge of my wit. I hugged her and this time, I tried to kiss her myself.</p>
<p>「Lo….Lov…..<em>mumble mumble</em>」</p>
<p>「……this can’t be happening.」</p>
<p>She gently fell asleep and I’m hesitant to wake her up. I also don’t have any interest in attacking her in her sleep. I love her and I want to make love with her only if she wants to. In order to get her to agree, I ask her “Let’s have sex”.</p>
<p>I put her down beside me and let her head rest on my shoulder.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>The sweet smell of Kurumi-san tickles my nostrils. I remember the scene earlier and my heart began to race. T-this isn’t good, I’m embarrassed!</p>
<p>「Hnn….hmmmmm…..」</p>
<p>「Ahahahahaha」</p>
<p>「sshhhut upp…..」</p>
<p>「(Ahahahahaha)」</p>
<p>The night still goes on&#8212;</p>
