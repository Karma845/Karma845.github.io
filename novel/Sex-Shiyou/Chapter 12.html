<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; There’s a Beautiful Girl in My Room….!</h3>

<p>We moved from the entrance of the house to the living room and settled at the dining table. The seating arrangement is Kurumi-san sitting opposite of me and Kasumi sitting next to Kurumi-san. Why isn’t Kurumi-san sitting next to me?</p>
<p>Despite such a frustrating thing, I briefly explained why Kurumi-san came to visit our house today.</p>
<p>「&#8212;she’s too busy with modeling and has few friends so I want you to be her friend. Hey, are you listening….?」</p>
<p>I can’t say that she was being bullied at school and it even got to the point that she tried to commit suicide so I tried to persuade Kasumi with a list of reasons that seems to be convincing.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t help but scream in dismay at the scene before me.</p>
<p>The scene before me was&#8212;</p>
<p>「What are your hobbies, Kurumi-san?」</p>
<p>「Well, about that…I don’t really have anything that I can call my hobby but…I like looking at beautiful sceneries and landscapes, Kasumi-chan.」</p>
<p>Kasumi asks her question one after another while clinging to Kurumi-san’s arm. Kurumi-san answers every question of her with a smile on her face but she stiffens slightly at first.</p>
<p>Although they only have met each other for a short time, they are already calling each other by their first names and they are even close.</p>
<p>I can understand Kasumi. I have talked about Kurumi-san’s charm to Kasumi many many times. Thanks to that, it is not strange that Kasumi’s favorability of Kurumi-san rises.</p>
<p>However, I don’t get Kurumi-san. This should be her first time meeting Kasumi. And yet, she’s showing her her smile that she has never shown me before and she’s even calling her Kasumi-chan.</p>
<p>I envy her so much. She’s only calling me with either “you” or “Lunati-kun”.</p>
<p>…..somehow, I feel like I need to do something!</p>
<p>「Scenery! Nice! Do you like night scenery?」</p>
<p>「I can’t say I like it but lately I like sunsets.」</p>
<p>However, despite my desperate entrance into their conversation, they just shrugged it off.</p>
<p>「Sunset, I see! I think it’s beautiful too.」</p>
<p>「Do you have any hobbies, Kasumi-chan?」</p>
<p>「I think I have….it should be basketball! And I’m also in a club! Are you involved in any club?」</p>
<p>「I played volleyball when I was in junior high school but since I entered high school, I became too busy with work so I did not get involved with any club when I was in first year. I’m free to join anywhere now but, it is already kind of awkward….」</p>
<p>「Ah, certainly. It takes courage to join a community that has already been formed.」</p>
<p>「Yes, in my case, it even happen to my class….when I was wondering if there was someone who would get along with me, your oniisan said he’ll introduce me to Kasumi-chan to be my friend.」</p>
<p>「I see….so that’s what happened! I’m rather happy desu! Please take care of me from now on, Kurumi-san!」</p>
<p>They held out each other’s hands and smiled shyly as they looked at each other. By the way, I think I already told you what she had just said. So, you really didn’t listen to me.</p>
<p>「I feel like my little sister is NTRing me.」</p>
<p>「Who NTR’d who!?」</p>
<p>「But look at the two of you&#8212;」</p>
<p>「! T-that’s not it! Kasumi-chan and I are not like that!」</p>

<p>「There are so many anime posters….amazing.」</p>
<p>That was the first thing Kurumi-san said when she saw my room. There’s no disgust and it seems like she was surprised to see something she has never encountered before.</p>
<p>「Hey….are you sure you want to stay here?」</p>
<p>In contrast, my little sister, who was beside me, is full of disgust. She even glared at me.</p>
<p>「The console is in my room and it will be too much trouble to take it to the living room, isn’t it?」</p>
<p>When I invited Kurumi-san over, I thought about how I could entertain her. The conclusion I came to was to play games which is pretty common.</p>
<p>If it were just me and Kurumi-san, there would be no problem with just talking with each other. However, Kasumi is with us. In order to deepen their friendship, we decided to play a game&#8212;one of the most famous racing games.</p>
<p>「Is that the only reason?」</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「……」</p>
<p>「Ulterior motive&#8212;」</p>
<p>「None」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>I denied it at the speed of light and turned my gaze away. I need to change the topic immediately.</p>
<p>「W-well, it looks like you’re getting along with Kurumi-san. Did you hit off?」</p>
<p>When I asked that, Kasumi replied “hmmm”. Then, she looked at Kurumi-san who’s curiously looking at the action figures in my room.</p>
<p>「Well, maybe…」</p>
<p>I had a gut feeling that it was a lie, probably because I’m her brother. However, I know that Kasumi is a good person and I know that she took a liking to Kurumi-san.</p>
<p>「Then, let’s play a game! To think that the day where I’ll be playing with Kurumi-san, it’s like a dream come true.」</p>
<p>So, I decided to behave as usual.</p>
<p>「Well, it’s also my first time playing games with my friends….I think I might be looking forward to it.」</p>
<p>「Well, technically speaking, I’m your future husband.」</p>
<p>「S-shut up! Y-you’re not!」</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kasumi came in between me and Kurumi-san with a smile. Kurumi-san herself was surprised.</p>
<p>「E-eh?」</p>
<p>「Why are you in the middle, Kasumi?」</p>
<p>「Because if you are next to each other, aniki will attack Kurumi-san, right?」</p>
<p>「I won’t!?」</p>
<p>What is she suddenly saying!?</p>
<p>「Really〜?」</p>
<p>「I would never force myself on her!」</p>
<p>「Ehhh? Is that so? Kurumi-san, please be careful. My brother is a pervert.」</p>
<p>Kasumi throws those words at Kurumi-san with a smile on her face. This girl…what an unjust thing to do! I turned my gaze to Kurumi-san to explain myself&#8212;</p>
<p>「………..!」</p>
<p>For some reason, she turned her gaze away.</p>
<p>「N-no way, aniki! You already attacked her….!」</p>
<p>「I didn’t attack her! I never attacked her!」</p>
<p>「Is that true, Kurumi-san?」</p>
<p>When Kasumi asked her, Kurumi-san took a deep breath and answered slowly.</p>
<p>「Y-yeah. He didn’t attack me.」</p>
<p>Hearing this, Kasumi let out a breath of relief. Hey, did you really think that I attacked her, my idiot little sister? Can’t you trust your family more?</p>
<p>「Then, I’m relieved. If my aniki does anything strange, please tell me immediately…ah, yeah! Here’s my contact info! Call me anytime!」</p>
<p>「T-thank you, Kasumi-chan.」</p>
<p>The two of them pulled out their phones and exchanged contact info while I was preparing the game and found our reflections on the no power TV monitor across the table.</p>
<p>The center is Kasumi and to her sides are Kurumi-san and me.</p>
<p>Fumu….</p>
<p>「We look like a couple with their child!」</p>
<p>「A-are you an idiot!」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>I was immediately denied.</p>
<p>「Right, we are a newlywed couple and their little sister.」</p>
<p>「T-that’s not what I meant! What are you saying in front of Kasumi-chan!?」</p>
<p>「Kasumi, your future sister-in-law-chan.」</p>
<p>「N-no!? We’re just friends! Don’t get me wrong, Kasumi-chan!」</p>
<p>We both looked at Kasumi, who was sandwiched between us. Then, her gaze wandered, and said a few words.</p>
<p>「Ah, etho….I-I’ll get some juice.」</p>
<p>After saying that, she left the room.</p>
