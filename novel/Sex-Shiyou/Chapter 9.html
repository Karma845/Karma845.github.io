<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; – I Went to School With a Beautiful Girl! </h3>


<p>When I arrived at school and changed into my school shoes at my shoebox, I was rained with strange gazes.</p>
<p>I guess it can’t be helped given how we had to go home yesterday. I wonder if Kurumi-san would be okay with this much attention. I was worried and looked at her face.</p>
<p>「…w-what’s wrong?」</p>
<p>「No, I just thought you were cute again today. I love you.」</p>
<p>「…! I-idiot! What are you suddenly talking about!?」</p>
<p>「Ah, if I say too much, I’ll come out as frivolous. This is troublesome. I’ve never been in love with anyone other than Kurumi-san so the only way I can think of to express my love is through words or physical…..contact?」</p>
<p>「I won’t do it!? By the way, a-are you serious when you said you never loved anyone but me?」</p>
<p>「That’s true. I never really knew how to like someone until I met Kurumi-san. However, after I met Kurumi-san, I couldn&#8217;t stop liking you even before I fell asleep or woke up. I have become someone that can’t live without Kurumi-san.」</p>
<p>「….I get what you mean but, that’s quite heavy.」</p>
<p>「What is?」</p>
<p>「Your love.」</p>
<p>「That’s terrible!?」</p>
<p>「Eh, I-I’m sorry….I didn’t mean it in a bad way. I’m rather flattered. You might think that I’m being calculating but I’m grateful that you’re like that given the situation.」</p>
<p>The situation she’s referring to might be what she’s currently experiencing. No, perhaps there’s something more&#8212;</p>
<p>「…Kurumi-san, I’ve been thinking about it since yesterday but, have you reached your “dere” period? It has finally come, right? You’re okay, right? That means we&#8217;re going to get married, right? No, we surely will. 」</p>
<p>「W-we’re not! Don’t decide it on your own!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s face turns bright red as she turns away. Cute. I want to take a picture of her. Should I buy an SLR?</p>
<p>「Oh? Ooohhhh, you two!」</p>
<p>As we changed into our school shoes and headed to the classroom, we were approached by someone from behind. When we looked back at that familiar voice, I saw Kirishima-kun waving his hands.</p>
<p>「Good morning, Kirishima-kun.」</p>
<p>「G-good morning, Kirishima-kun.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san’s shoulder trembles as she moves one step closer to me. I’m happy but I’m a little sorry for Kirishima-kun since he’s not a bad person. However, Kirishima-kun smiles without minding Kurumi-san’s attitude.</p>
<p>「Good morning. You two are….flirting so early this morning.」</p>
<p>「! You noticed!? As expected of my best friend, Kirishima-kun!」</p>
<p>「W-which eye are you using to see that nonsense!? We’re not! We are not flirting! I won’t flirt with him!」</p>
<p>「That’s what Koga said. What can you say about that, Lunati-kun?」</p>
<p>「Well, it’s not an exaggeration to say that we are flirting! We went to school together and we are sweet and even sticking up with each other! 」</p>
<p>「I-it’s true that we went to school together but….I’m not even sticking with you! Don’t say something disgusting!」</p>
<p>「It’s not disgusting!?」</p>
<p>「No, I think the way you talk is creepy as hell.」</p>
<p>「Even Kirishima-kun thinks so!? That….well, for reference, can I ask what you feel disgusted?」</p>
<p>When I asked her that, Kurumi-san answered without hesitation.</p>
<p>「When you said we were sticking up with each other and we were sweet.」</p>
<p>「But it&#8217;s true. We were sticking up with each other!」</p>
<p>「Wa-wait, don’t say that out loud!」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san blushed bright red and slapped my face. However, it doesn’t hurt at all. I even feel that it made me recover because of her cuteness.</p>
<p>「……oi oi. Seriously. Did your relationship advance that far?」</p>
<p>「Yeah, because we love each other.」</p>
<p>「We don’t! It’s one-sided!」</p>
<p>As we were arguing, the bell rang, signaling it was five minutes before homeroom. When he heard that, Kirishima-kun moved immediately.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>「L-let’s go now! Ah, right. Hey, Lunati-kun, I’m releasing the hostage! I’ll go ahead.」</p>
<p>「Ah, bag-chan! I’m glad you’re safe!」</p>
<p>As soon as I was celebrating my reunion with bag-chan, Kirishima-kun ran up the stairs and headed for the classroom. I carried bag-chan on my shoulder and looked at Kurumi-san. She’s looking at me with envious eyes.</p>
<p>「….Kurumi-san?」</p>
<p>「….you guys get along well, don’t you?」</p>
<p>I neither confirm nor deny words. She doesn’t have any friends of the same sex. Her job is currently on hold and she’s being oppressed at school. I can’t do anything now but hold her hand.</p>
<p>「It’s not like me to keep quiet so I’ll just say what’s on my mind.」</p>
<p>「….what?」</p>
<p>「I love you, Kurumi-san. Because of that, I can’t be friends with you. Kirishima-kun is a good guy but he’s a man so I don’t think he’ll suit the relationship Kurumi-san is looking forward to.」</p>
<p>「……you’re right.」</p>
<p>A shadow is cast on her face and her voice is trembling a little.</p>
<p>Then, I told her.</p>
<p>「So, let me introduce you to my little sister.」</p>
<p>「…..ye…..yeah? We’re having a serious conversation now. Why did you turn it somewhere weird?」</p>
<p>「Are you saying you can’t be her friend?」</p>
<p>「No no no! I’m willing to be her friend! I was just surprised by your unexpected suggestion!?」</p>
<p>「My little sister is a good person! She sometimes says harsh things but that’s the flip side of kindness. She’s caring, attentive, and above all, my family! You don’t have to worry about anything since she will be your sister in law in the future!」</p>
<p>「W-why do you always have to push forward to marriage!?」</p>
<p>「Ahahaha, you don’t have to be shy!」</p>
<p>「I’m not shy!?」</p>
<p>「I’ll invite you over to my house in the near future. I will not only introduce my little sister to you but also to my parents!」</p>
<p>「We’re not even dating yet!」</p>
<p>「We’ll get married sooner or later, it’s just a matter of time so it won’t make any difference. It’s okay, everyone’s nice. Your mother-in-law will not give you a hard time! Rest assured!」</p>
<p>「……haa………..hou, you’re really…..I thought we were going to have a serious conversation halfway. I was a fool.」</p>
<p>「? I’m always serious when it comes to Kurumi-san’s happiness!」</p>
<p>She glares at me with reproachful eyes and speaks plainly.</p>
<p>「…….really, you’re really a sly one.」</p>
<p>「What do you mean by sly&#8212;」</p>
<p>Just as I was saying that, the bell rang again, announcing the start of homeroom. Oh no, we’re late. In our school, if you’re not in class when the homeroom starts, you’ll be marked as tardy even if you’re already at school.</p>
<p>When I looked at Kurumi-san, she gave out a long sigh. She probably thought we should go to class first.</p>
<p>「Haa」</p>
<p>「You’ve been sighing a lot lately.」</p>
<p>「Who do you think is responsible for this?&#8230;.w-well, I’m happy so I guess it’s okay.」</p>
<p>Kurumi-san said something in a low voice.</p>
<p>「Sorry, what did you say?」</p>
<p>「Nothing」</p>
<p>「I’m glad that you’re happy.」</p>
<p>「So you heard me! Y-you! Let’s just go to the classroom!」</p>
<p>「Yeah, let’s go to the class while holding hands like this.」</p>
<p>「….have we been holding hands all this time!? My god!」</p><div class='code-block code-block-8 ai-viewport-1' style='margin: 8px 0; clear: both;'>

<p>She took her hand away from mine. I’m sad. However, smile returned to Kurumi-san’s face. I’m glad. While embracing both emotions, I headed to the classroom following Kurumi-san.</p>
