<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; </h3>


<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-5"><h1 class="calibre1">Infinite Gacha:  Ch 1 - Ep17 Change of attitude</h1><p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Another
day comes to an end.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
the night falls, the Adventurer's Guild is crowded with adventurers who have
returned from the dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Many
of them have been staying in the dungeon for so long that they smell bad.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Without
a single stain or any bad smell on us, we walked through them to the reception
counter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
soon as the dwarf receptionist noticed us, she jumped out from the counter.
Previously she questioned our honesty and looked down at us when we were
exchanging magic stones. She even muttered in a small voice, "You're too
cocky for a human......." </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
welcomed me with open arms as if her previous behavior was just a lie.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama,
I'm glad to see you back safe and sound today! Aren't you tired? Would you like
us to prepare dinner for you? Or would you prefer a drink?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
neither is necessary. May I ask the payment first?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Of
course!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Thank you again for the large number of
magic stones!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
she replied, she quickly moved to an empty receptionist counter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold,
carrying a bag with a large number of magic stones, watcher her back and
mutters.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
In a way, it's a pleasantly amazing change of attitude. Just a few days ago,
she used to be buzzing about 'human beings."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
for myself, I can't stand the way she's looking at Dark-sama......."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
let out a disgusted voice sound, and Nemumu puffed out her cheeks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
chuckled under my mask and headed for the counter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
put the bag he was carrying on the counter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
receptionist has a bright grin on her face as if there are gold and silver
treasure in front of her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ahhhhh,
there are so many magic stones from the 5th floor today ...! As expected from
Dark-sama party! This is so amazing!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Why
has the receptionist's attitude changed so much?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fifth level is a snowfield, and the magic stones of the monsters that live
there have an ice attribute.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are also used to cool things down and to add attributes to weapons and armor.
However, the supply is far less than the demand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
city's dungeon hierarchy is as follows: the first level is grassland, the
second a desert, the third a swamp, the fourth a jungle, and the fifth a
snowfield.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
jungle on the fourth level is very dense, and even a beast with a good sense of
direction could get lost in it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
number of adventurers who can reach the fifth level, the snowfield, is very
few.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
since we had SR, Flight, we can fly to the stairs and reach the fifth level
without worrying about the jungle ruining our sense of direction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As a
result, we came back with many ice magic stones in just a day trip.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
receptionist apologized on her knees in front of the overwhelming supply of ice
magic stones.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
pleaded with tears in her eyes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
very sorry about the other day! I will make sure that all guild members,
including myself, do not behave in such a rude manner in the future! Please,
please do not change the location of your activities!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
beg you! If people find out that I spoke ill of an adventurer who brought in
many ice magic stones in just one day, not only my neck, but also the necks of
all this town guild staff will be in danger! I'm going to make a special
exception and raise your adventurer rank from a novice to a full-fledged
adventurer, so please!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
is not only restaurants that need ice magic stones.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are also in demand for weapons and armors because they are needed to add the
ice attribute. They are also in high demand for research purposes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is why the supply is extremely insufficient to meet the demand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
if the adventurers who deliver many magic stones in one day are mistreated just
because they are "humans", maybe that adventurers will move to
another dungeon city.......</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">*If
that happens, they could have had their heads physically chopped off.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Thank
you so much! Please come again next time!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
the payment was made, the receptionist looked at us with a warm gaze as we left
the counter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
if they were waiting for us, some adventurers greeted us with loud voices.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Young
master, Big sister, Big Brother, nice work!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Well
done!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are
you guys going to the bar to drink again today?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the bar attached to the adventurer's guild, the bear beastman and his men who
had messed with us before stand up from their seats and greet us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
neutralized them after they attacked us. Then, Gold said, "I'll teach them
chivalry spirit personally," so I left them to him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
beastmen became very polite, probably because Gold had taught them the chivalry
spirit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
particular, whenever they saw us, whether in a tavern or on the street, they
would bow and refer to me as "Young master," Nemumu as "Big
sister," and Gold as "Big brother".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Is
this what Gold calls "chivalry spirit"?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(It
seems to be different from the stories of knights that I heard when I was a
child or the "chivalry" that I heard during my "Races
Union" days. ......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
wanted to comment, but they seemed satisfied, so it would be foolish to mention
it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
happily speaks to the bear beastman in front of him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Lord,
since I'm about to have a drink with these guys, can we split up here for the
night?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are
you serious, brother?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Then come on, Young Master, let's have a
drink together!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear beastman, who had looked down on me when we first met, bowed his head and
invited me to join him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
men responded to his invitation by shouting.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey,
Nemumu Big sis!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Please have a drink next to me!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Big
sis can't drink with a smelly guy like you next to her!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">So
please, have a drink next to me!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
Big sis will drink next to me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
the men invited her to join them, Nemumu pushed her scarf up to her nose in
deep disgust and rejected them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
talk to me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
men shrugged their shoulders.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear beastman quickly made another suggestion to change the mood.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
about you, Young Master?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">When
I was about your age, I was already drinking a lot, so it's not a
problem."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
drinking age is 15 years old, but there are not many people who follow this
rule.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
it is known that drinking alcohol from childhood is bad for health, so parents
should be careful not to let their children drink if they are still too young.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
quickly interrupts his suggestion.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Do
not teach Dark-sama bad things! It is too soon for Dark-sama."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
no, Miss, it's not too soon. Besides, it's perfectly healthy to have a drink. A
bad thing to do is to fuck women while using drugs to gets high. It feels so
good that it makes you feel like your brain is going to explode, but if you do
it too much, you'll become an idiot."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"</span>
<span class="calibre13">How
dare you talk vulgar things in front of Dark-sama?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Thank
you!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear-beast man was beaten by Nemumu and forced to stop talking.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
repeatedly thanked her with a bleeding nose and a heartfelt look of happiness
on his face.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
his men see the bear beastman like that...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Boss,
that's not fair! I want it too!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Big
sis, give me a beating too!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
instead of these guys, please beat me!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Other
beastmen gathered around her and shouted, "Please beat me up".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't help but laugh behind my mask at sight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You
guys are really the worst......."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
laughed, but Nemumu looked down on the men who gathered asking her to beat
them.</span></p>
