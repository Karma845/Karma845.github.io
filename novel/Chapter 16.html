<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; Getting Stronger quickly in the Labyrinth’s Underground! ⑥</h3>


<p>Finally, we will soon be going into the middle layer area of this labyrinth.</p>
</div>
<div id="“novel_honbun”" class="“novel_view”">

<p>It is an area of both this floor that I’m currently at and the floor below.</p>

<p>And both of these floor combined, the area in between is called middle layer area.</p>
</div>

<p>On a side note, the floor that I’m at now is made entirely made out of wood.</p>

<p>And, monsters that had appeared were all undead.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as expected of a middle floor, the rank of the undeads are high.</p>

<p>Undeads like liches and ワイスキング(TN: I cannot find this; wise king???), and even</p>
<p>vampires…… the kings of the dark is on parade.</p>

<p>With the mana from the dragons, it is said that high ranking undeads were summoned</p>
<p>on a regular basis from the realm of the undead……</p>

<p>Well, putting that aside, it is really appropriate to be calling this dungeon a labyrinth(TN:</p>
<p>as in literal maze).</p>

<p>The area(surface area?) is 500 metres x 500 metres wide.</p>

<p>The passage for every wooden space is about one and a half metres and it’ll branch off</p>
<p>somewhere and continue. If you walk blindly, you are sure to get lost.</p>

<p>And here, with starvation as a bonus (due to lack of food), this combo is very hard to</p>
<p>avoid.</p>

<p>There is no place for water, no food besides the rotten meat of the undeads, it is</p>
<p>unbearable.(TN: to what? eat their meat?)</p>

<p>Well, in my case, if I went and battled an undead…… as my status suggests, it will be very</p>
<p>tough to fight one.</p>

<p>If there are a few of them, even the dragon tribe cannot let their guard down on these</p>
<p>high level monsters. Well, that is something that cannot be done.</p>

<p>That huge area and countless of roaming undead…… in actuality, this maze prides on</p>
<p>being as hard as a punishment game level, a lot of young dragons lives were ended here.</p>

<p>「So…… This is the entrance towards the next floor」</p>

<p>Lilith said with a dubious expression.</p>

<p>「……Clearing time is 20 minutes. The number of encounters with enemies is 5…… which</p>
<p>included me escaping 3 times」</p>
<p>「I had made preparations for this. There are rules in creating mazes, even if I didn’t</p>
<p>remember the map for it…… it is possible to clear this place」</p>

<p>As I said that, I pointed towards the geometric art carved onto the wall.</p>

<p>Well, this is a type of cryptanalysis.</p>

<p>If you’d noticed the rule of replacing the symbols with strings (文字列)…… You could</p>
<p>conclude that the correct route is pointed by an arrow.</p>

<p>It means that not only is one’s strength being tested, but intelligence is too.</p>

<p>「……At the floor before, we could only run away from the giant catfish. And before that,</p>
<p>we ran away from the golem………… I don’t think that…… you can beat the guardian of the</p>
<p>deepest floor」</p>
<p>「Aa, of course」</p>

<p>Lilith continued her words with a dissatisfied expression.</p>

<p>「…… Then…… you should earn some experience points on this floor……」</p>

<p>「Not just ‘<em>some</em>’」</p>

<p>「……?」</p>

<p>I smiled towards Lilith with her head tilted and said.</p>

<p>「The numbers of high ranked undead monsters on this floor is about hundreds right?」</p>

<p>「……Perhaps it is about that much. Or maybe more than that」</p>

<p>「—Now, I will <em>deliciously</em> take down everything」</p>

<p>「……You want to…… plan on staying here for a few months? Water is limited and food</p>
<p>too, is scarce. I know it’s bad to say but…… I don’t think you can continuously win against</p>
<p>the monsters here until they are all gone」</p>

<p>Aa, this kid…… still as diligent as ever.</p>

<p>No, well, it’s not like I dislike it or anything.</p>

<p>「I don’t plan to stay here for a few months. I will settle it in one go」</p>

<p>「One go…… how long will it take?」</p>

<p>I raised one finger and said.</p>

<p>「One day…… no, half a day」</p>

<p>Eyes wide open.</p>

<p>Lilith shrugged her shoulders appalled.</p>

<p>「……It is impossible」</p>

<p>「No, I must do it」</p>

<p>I looked at Lilith with a serious look.</p>

<p>And she somehow gets that I was about to say something serious.</p>

<p>「……How are you planning to do it?」</p>

<p>She nodded her head and held her breath for my answer.</p>

<p>「So…… we will aim for the next floor」</p>

<p>Almost falling, Lilith shuddered in anger.</p>

<p>「…….I really hate jokes that are not funny. Even though we were talking about the</p>
<p>monsters on this floor, why are you thinking about the next floor?」</p>
<p>What I said was not a joke, I was really serious.</p>

<p>「I think, just maybe, you too hate jokes that are not funny right?」</p>

<p>「……Your right. I don’t really get jokes」</p>

<p><em>Yes, I knew.</em></p>

<p>Well, she does gives of that sort of vibe…… you can say that she is very unsociable, or is</p>
<p>less expressive, or better, very much like a robot…….</p>

<p>That’s really wasteful for a beauty.</p>

<p>Well, noisy ones just like Cordelia are also included.</p>

<p>「……So…… if we were talking about hunting the monsters on this floor…… why mention</p>
<p>the next floor……? I absolutely…… don’t understand」</p>

<p>「If you see what’s going to happen soon, you will surely get it. Let’s quickly…… obliterate</p>
<p>the guys on this floor」(EN: I still don’t get why the author uses such weird pauses in the</p>
<p>speech…)</p>

<p>I pulled Lilith’s hand.</p>

<p>And—</p>
<p>— We started going down the spiral staircase leading to the next floor.</p>
