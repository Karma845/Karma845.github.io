<h3>Prequel &#8211; Yahiro Side</h3>

<p style="font-size:18px;">The knife that was thrust out with the resolve to take the opponent down together, pierced the throat of the monster in the front.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A beast with a height around twice as much as that of a person. It is a black cat with a sulfur-smelling breath and can breathe out scorching hot flames.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The monster roared wildly while baring its fangs.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While enduring the dregs of the flame that can burn the skin, the boy shoves the knife in his grip into the monster’s body.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The cracked up road surface. The thick, disorderly grown weeds.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In the ruined city, where not a figure of a person can be seen, only the voices of the noisy cicadas were resounding.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After a long moment that felt like an eternity, the one to reach its limit first was the monster.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Darkish miasma gushes out instead of fresh blood, and the giant jet-black body crumbles as if breaking apart.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The boy moved back with unsteady feet, watching that all the way till the end.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Now that the extreme tension had come to a stop, his temples throbbed with dull pain. He couldn’t raise his arms due to fatigue.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">As he leaned against the wall of a building, trying to fix his erratic breathing, a voice suddenly came out of the communicator. It was the hoarse voice of an old person.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Yahiro……Oi, Yahiro, respond. Are you alive?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Shut up, Ed. I can hear you.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The boy called Yahiro replied to the headset in his ear.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The person on the other end of the line was Eduardo Valenzuela. He was an old man with a Mexican nationality.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Although he claims to be an art dealer, that title is almost a fraud.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Transporting valuable artworks out of ruined and abandoned cities, and selling them to dilettantes of other countries. That was Ed’s livelihood. At best, calling him a scavenger or someone who takes advantage of a situation to loot was correct.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, Yahiro cannot criticize him. That’s because being the one to actually enter the ruined city, and bring back art pieces at Ed’s requests, was Yahiro’s job. In other words, he is the subcontractor of the looter──A retriever.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Fufun, so you have taken care of the Spirit Beast. As one would expect from you.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After noticing Yahiro’s worn-out voice, Ed said in admiration.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro frowned at the old man’s attitude, who was acting as if this was someone else’s problem</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;As expected my foot. What’s your intention, Ed? Didn’t you say there won’t be any Spirit Beasts in this area!?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「I see. So it did appear after all. Do you know what type it was?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Ed asks back nonchalantly without feeling any guilt. Yahiro rudely clicks his tongue and says,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I don’t know. It was a ridiculously large cat that looked like a brown bear. It could spit fire too.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Fire breathing black cat……Ovinnik huh. It’s a rare species. That information might sell at a high price.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The old man went ‘fofofofo’, laughing in satisfaction.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;What do you mean by ‘might sell at a high price’, huh? Don’t go exploiting people just to make a few more bucks! How many times do you think I almost died just because of your sloppy info!?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Leaving that aside, Yahiro. Where are you right now?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Aah? I’ve just crossed the Sumida river into the former Taito ward. About 15 minutes away from Ueno.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Roughly on schedule then.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">There was a sign of Ed unfolding a paper map on the other side of the wireless line. Even if Ed is a completely untrustworthy guy, he is Yahiro’s client. No matter how much he finds him unpleasant, Yahiro has no choice but to follow his directions.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;So, which art gallery is today’s destination? Or should I head towards a museum?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「No no. I’ll have you go south and head towards Akihabara.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Akihabara? Is there any artwork left in that kind of place?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro asks back in a puzzled tone.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">What Ed mainly deals with are antiques like swords and vases, or sometimes art pieces of the old sort. It would’ve been a different thing if it was about Ueno district with its numerous art galleries and museums, but retrieving something from a commercial district like Akihabara was rare.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Ed chuckled as if enjoying Yahiro’s confusion and said,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Today’s purpose is not any antique. It’s a figurine.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Figurine? Do you mean something like a clay figure or haniwa?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Wrong. I’m talking about anime character figurines. The figures intended for enthusiasts.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;……Ha? Figures?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Caught off-guard, Yahiro lost his words. Putting his life on the line to infiltrate an isolation zone crawling with monsters, what he has to bring back is an anime character figurine. It was his first time hearing such a ridiculous request.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「It’s a request by a wealthy person from Southeast Asia. It’s a one-of-a-kind handmade piece created by the charismatic sculptor named Masa himself. It’s something the client had been searching for many years.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;……No, well, it doesn’t matter to me as long as I get paid.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro muttered, swallowing down his inner conflicts. Half of it was to persuade himself.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「One figure is worth a hundred thousand dollars. Don’t you think that’s a good way to earn some money?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;What percentage of that are you planning to take for yourself?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro asks the old man, who is laughing in a hoarse voice.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Don’t worry. I’ll leave half of it for you. I’ll deduct my expenses from it, though.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;That’s too much of a rip-off! Isn’t all you do is just call from an air-conditioned room!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Don’t you think that’s fair considering I’m making a serious deal with a Japanese like you?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;tsu……!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">At Ed’s mocking words, Yahiro bit down hard on his molars.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">As much as it was vexing, it’s exactly as he said. There’s rarely anyone left in this country right now willing to hire Yahiro. That&#8217;s because he is a Japanese survivor.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Contact me when you reach the station and be careful during your trip. Well, that may be a needless worry for a cursed immortal Japanese like you.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Ed cuts the communication, leaving behind those words said in a sarcastic tone.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Facing the now silent mic of the headset, Yahiro muttered as if spitting out.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Drop dead, you geezer.&#8220;</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>†</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was a memory of that day──The day when a giant dragon appeared in the skies above Tokyo.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Blood-red rain poured down the streets, and as if in response to the appearance of the dragon, numerous natural disasters covered the entire nation of Japan.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was soon after that fierce, mysterious creatures that defied all existing biological senses, broke out all over the country.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Possessing forms that resembled that of mythical creatures, deformed life-forms that would later be known as Spirit Beasts.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">They indiscriminately attacked and ate people, and destroyed the cities.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">With Spirit Beasts that could withstand military-use rifle bullets as opponents, not only the police, but even the JSDF was powerless. The Japanese government, which was in a state of confusion due to the frequently occurring natural disasters, completely stopped functioning. It is said that within a week from the appearance of the Spirit Beasts, half of the population of Japan was lost.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Naturally, it wasn’t as if the international community sat idle and stared at the disastrous scene.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Countries from all around the world arranged donations and relief supplies, and the preparation to dispatch the international disaster relief team was underway.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That information encouraged many Japanese who were overwhelmed by the tragedies. They thought just as the nation called Japan experienced many times in the past, we’ll recover from this unprecedented disaster even if it takes time, and regain the peaceful everyday lifestyle. Everyone had such unfounded expectations.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It wasn’t long after that another unusual event occurred.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Without any warning, dignitaries, heads of states and religious leaders ordered their people in unison, as if prepared beforehand.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Kill the Japanese. Annihilate them.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;"><ruby>J-nocide<rt>Great Massacre</rt></ruby>──The 『Japanese Hunt』had begun.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Six months later. The natural disasters brought by the dragon subsides, and at the same time, the Great Massacre also ends.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The amount of casualties during that period was over 126 million──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">And then the Japanese ceased to exist.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Leaving behind only a handful of survivors.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In front of the Akihabara station were the terribly ruined remains of a once bustling city.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The countries that invaded Japan for the J-nocide number more than 30. 8 of those countries continue to station their troops in Japan, while dividing and ruling it.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, the population density is extremely low, since the Japanese that were supposed to be occupied had been annihilated.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The occupying army is only stationed in major ports and large cities. More than half of the Japanese archipelago has been left in a state of anarchy, and has become a lawless zone overrun by international terrorists or criminals.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But there are places where even those criminals rarely set foot into.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Those are the 23 wards──The region once known as the Tokyo Metropolitan Area.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The economic and political center of Japan. The reason why the former capital was designated as an Isolation Zone was simple. The appearance rate of Spirit Beasts was exceptionally high compared to other places.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That&#8217;s the reason why even now, when 4 years have passed since the J-nocide, the buildings have been left intact and a lot of valuable artworks or traditional handicrafts are left untouched.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Nevertheless, having gone through the Great Slaughter, the streets of Akihabara weren’t left unscathed as expected.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The buildings had received serious damages due to the frequent natural disasters, and traces of the attacks caused by Spirit Beasts were etched all over the streets. It seemed like the goods destroyed by fire didn’t number a few.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I’ve reached the place, Ed. However, is there really a figurine left behind in this kind of place.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro asked, after calling the self-proclaimed 『Art Dealer』 again.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「You don’t have to worry about that. The interior of the building is mostly unharmed. We’ve also verified the safety of the figurine.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;……Verified? How?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Just around a week ago, the retrieval unit of a major businessman went inside and saw it with their own eyes.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While setting foot into the building designated by Ed, Yahiro makes a grim face.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Retrievers other than Yahiro had already visited this place. It was his first time hearing that.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Hey wait a minute. Then why didn’t those guys bring the figurine back. What happened to the so-called retrieval unit?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Well……I heard that they lost contact after reporting the discovery of the figurine……」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro unconsciously lowered his posture and surveyed his surroundings.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It’s a large commercial building close to the Akihabara station. It seems like every floor was occupied by various tenants, and even now, when it&#8217;s reduced to ruins, things like electronic devices or toys are left behind undamaged.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It would be a mountain of treasure for someone who knows their value.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Of course, there’s no presence of a person other than Yahiro in his surroundings.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, Yahiro felt a faint sense of discomfort in the atmosphere inside the building.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A faint smell of blood lingered in the stale air of the ruins.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Aah, yeah. Come to think of it, they heard a weird scream right before losing contact. A ghost being in the building or something like that.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Ghost……?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The communication cut right after Yahiro asked back. The signals were lost since he had proceeded deep into the building.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">As if waiting for that moment, the air shimmered in the dim light.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Old VCRs and other large electronic devices whose purpose he didn’t know, floated gently without making any sound, defying gravity. That unrealistic scene made Yahiro shudder.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The electronic devices move through the air, shaking erratically.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was a really bizarre, fear inducing scene. And then the electronic devices, shaking like a pendulum, start to accelerate. Aiming at Yahiro who was still standing in shock, they attack like a cannonball.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Seriously? Hey……⁉︎&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The electronic devices crashed into the wall behind Yahiro who jumped aside in the spur of the moment. The fragments of the machines scattered along with the thick sound of concrete breaking.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Is this the poltergeist thing!? Shit, what the hell is going on!?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro rolled down the passageway while avoiding the fragments that were raining down.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Another electronic device flew right above his head. Even if a single one of them hit him, it would have enough power to smash his skull.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The sounds of the crashing electronic devices continued to echo, but there was no sign of the one controlling them.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The word &#8220;ghost&#8221; Ed had mentioned, strangely, had a taste of truthfulness.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Eventually, Yahiro, who got cornered at the end of the passageway, noticed the dead body lying in front of him. And it wasn’t just one, but 5-6 bodies simply piled up.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Are these guys the retrievers Ed talked about……?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Unlike outcasts like Yahiro, they were a special retrieval unit hired by major corporations. Wearing the uniforms of a private military company, they were brawny <ruby>operators<rt>combatants</rt></ruby> with military backgrounds.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, their corpses were awfully damaged, and there wasn’t any that still retained its original form.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">They were eaten by Spirit Beasts, Yahiro realized.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">If that’s the case, then there’s a high chance that the poltergeist attacking Yahiro is also the work of a Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Nevertheless, there is no sign of a Spirit Beast in Yahiro’s field of vision.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">All he can see are the numerous electronic devices flying about in the air.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;The real body is……⁉︎&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While avoiding the electronic devices flying at him, suddenly Yahiro’s whole body stopped moving, along with an intense pain.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It wasn’t as if he lost the sensations of his arms and legs. However, his body wouldn’t move, as if bound by invisible chains.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Paralysis──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Without getting the time to be perplexed by that psychic phenomenon, Yahiro’s right shoulder received an intense shock. The sound of his clavicle breaking resounded after being struck directly by the large electronic device.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After losing the strength in his right hand, the knife he was gripping dropped. The space in front of Yahiro splits apart, as if waiting for that moment.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">By the time he realized it was a monster’s compound eye, it was too late. Fresh blood sprouts out from Yahiro’s torso after being torn apart by a giant claw.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Spirit Beast……From where……⁉︎&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While not knowing what happened, his battered figure rolled down the passageway.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The wound gouged out by the monster’s claw reaches the back of his body. His lungs were ripped, and his heart was most likely crushed.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">His entire body went numb and lost its strength. Unable to scream, Yahiro spits out a clot of blood, and looks at the ceiling in a daze. He feels his consciousness slowly fading away.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The voice of a Spirit Beast, as if laughing in triumph, comes from above his head──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The last thing that was reflected in his blurred vision was his own blood stopped midair, like droplets of water.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>†</strong></p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I’m glad you were still alive, Nii-sama──&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In the middle of his hazy consciousness, a clear voice echoes with a hint of laughter.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was the memory of that day──The day when the Great Slaughter began.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A girl, accompanied by a flying 『monster』 behind her, is quietly looking down at the shivering Narusawa Yahiro.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While bathing in the pouring deep crimson rain, Narusawa Sui smiles softly.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Accompanied by the giant dragon spreading its rainbow-colored wings behind her, the bloodstained girl says──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;──or else, were you unable to die?&#8221;</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>†</strong></p>


<p style="font-size:18px;">Blue-white sparks flew in the dimly lit passageway.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro’s right arm, which he unconsciously pushed out, knocked down the fangs of the Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The unexpected counterattack by the supposedly dead prey clearly agitated the Spirit Beast, who shouldn’t have any emotions.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Taking advantage of the moment, Yahiro grabbed the knife and sprang back up.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Just before his entire body got stiff again, he brandished his knife in the empty space above his head. With the satisfying sound of something tearing up, his body, which was on the verge of stiffening, became able to move freely again.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;So this thing is behind the paralysis and poltergeist from earlier.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro muttered languidly while grabbing the torn up thread.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was a semi-transparent fiber that looked like a spider’s thread but many times tougher. That thread had clung to his entire body before he could notice, and was inhibiting his movements. It was also this thread that made those heavy electronic devices float in the air, aiming at Yahiro.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The Spirit Beast disappears, blending into the darkness, after realizing it can’t stop Yahiro’s movements.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, Yahiro already knew about this trick. It was a camouflage.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The Spirit Beast lurking in this building could change its body color like a chameleon or octopus to hide, and hunted the prey that wandered in.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was quite a mundane ability, and not a big deal if you knew the trick.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was his assumptions that delayed him from realizing that.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro narrowly escaped death, due to being misled by the &#8220;ghost&#8221; Ed spoke about.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It wouldn’t be strange for an ordinary person to die with those injuries and blood loss.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But ironically, that blood loss taught Yahiro the true form of the Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Fresh blood sticking to the threads laid out in the darkness made their existence clear, and made the transparent Spirit Beast visible.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">SHAAAAAAAAAA──!</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Realizing that it&#8217;s camouflage was found out, the Spirit Beast fully exposes its form and roars.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A spider with a reptilian outer skin──or a deformed monster that can be called as such.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">8 limbs with sharp claws growing at the tip, and a mouth with countless fangs closely lined up, resembling that of a man-eating shark.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The upper body of the Spirit Beast alone is close to 3 meters. Even without the transparency caused by the camouflage, it&#8217;s not an opponent you can underestimate.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In spite of that, Yahiro showed a ferocious smile while looking up at the Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;──The hero Seigfreid, from the Germanic legends, killed a dragon and supposedly got an immortal body by bathing in its blood.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">With a speed unimaginable by its great size, the Spirit Beast shot at Yahiro’s shoulder with a stretched out claw. However, that claw got easily repelled right after tearing his jacket.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The fresh blood Yahiro shed hardened, and stuck to his body’s surface like an armor.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">His skin itself also turned hard, changing its form into something like steel scales.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The lungs and heart that should have been crushed finished regenerating, and the supposedly torn up flesh got covered by the armor of blood.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">An immortal body possessing a skin of steel──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That’s the power Yahiro acquired on that deep crimson rainy day.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Bathing in a dragon’s blood, it was the power of a cursed dragon slaying immortal.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Apparently, I’m the same as that hero. Sorry, but I can’t be killed!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro thrust the knife wet with his own blood into the Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Although it was a somewhat large military knife, compared to the large body of the Spirit Beast, the blade was too thin and unreliable.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, the effect was dramatic.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">With the wound gouged out by the knife as the center, cracks were generated all over the Spirit Beast’s body. Yahiro’s blood, corrupted by the dragon’s blood, is a lethal, deadly poison for the Spirit Beasts.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The large body, that became frail, crumbled while spreading jet black miasma.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro sighed deeply while looking at it with a blank expression.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>†</strong></p>


<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I’ve finished, Ed&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro turned on his communicator again after moving to a place by a window that had good reception.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The old art dealer, instead of being glad at Yahiro’s safety, complained that he was late.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Did you defeat the Spirit Beast?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Yeah somehow.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「Hou……」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Ed lets out a surprised voice. He certainly didn’t expect Yahiro to repel the Spirit Beast that annihilated the retrieval unit of the major businessman, by himself.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Leaving that aside, tell me the characteristics of the requested figure. I want to leave before being noticed by the other Spirit Beasts, but I can’t distinguish between the figures.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro said, looking back behind him.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">He was able to locate the site of the model shop, however the figures in it numbered more than a few hundred. Yahiro didn’t have any idea of which one to bring back.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, Ed says with a careless tone.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「You’ll find it soon. It’s the magical girl Ouragan-chan displayed near the entrance of the store. A 1/1 scale of her.」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;1/1 scale……?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「In short, it’s life-sized. As expected from the masterpiece of someone who reached the pinnacle of Japan’s perverted techniques, isn’t it magnificently modelled? 」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Life-size……you mean the same size as people?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro surveyed his surroundings while being bewildered.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">He thought he heard it wrong, but in front of the hobby shop’s entrance──there was a figure of a beautiful girl placed in the most conspicuous place. The figure is around 160 cm tall, including the pedestal.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The costume of the character called magical girl is pointlessly covered in fluttering frills, and yet the degree of exposure is unnecessarily high. It was revealing to that extent that one could see the inside of the skirt just by standing there.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I have to break out of the 23 wards holding this!? Me!?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro said with an extremely miserable voice.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Being a Japanese survivor, he was used to being scorned at and ridiculed.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, this life-sized beautiful girl figure was dangerous. He had a hunch that if someone saw him walking while holding this magical girl, he won’t be able to ever recover. No matter how much of an immortal dragonslayer he is, it isn’t as if he also has an invincible mental strength.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">「︎It’s a job worth a hundred thousand. Be patient. Don’t you have to look for your missing sister?」</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Ed said in a carefree tone, as if it was someone else’s problem.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro gritted his teeth while feeling conflicted.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">He has to find his sister, who went missing ever since the Great Massacre. To earn the expenses for that, Yahiro continues to work as the sole retriever in the 23 wards crowded with Spirit Beasts.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Because……of the dragon……! Shit, I’ll definitely pay this debt back……Sui……!</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Yahiro holds up the bewitchingly modelled life-sized figure, while shaking in humiliation.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">And then once again, the immortal boy walked towards the ruined city.</p>
