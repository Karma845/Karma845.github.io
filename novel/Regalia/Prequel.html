<h3>Prequel &#8211; Ayaho &amp; Iroha Side</h3>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p style="font-size:18px;">That day──That summer day 4 years ago.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A giant dragon appeared in the skies above Tokyo, and blood-colored rain poured down the streets.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">And then the Japanese ceased to exist.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>†</strong></p>


<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I’ve prepared a bento&#8221;, said Iroha-chan with a slightly proud look.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Rice balls, rolled omelets, braised pork belly and kinpira gobo<sup><a id="a1" href="#n1">[1]</a></sup>. The latter two are canned, though.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While carefully hugging the rucksack she put her stuff in, she smiled.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Her long, light-brown hair is crystal clear in the gentle spring sunlight.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan is 16 years old, three years older than me. With a small face, slender figure and big eyes, she’s a young woman with really pretty features.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">This impression of her hasn’t changed ever since I first met her 4 years ago.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Even the reddish-brown school jersey looks somewhat cute if she’s the one wearing it.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I would’ve at least prepared the bento if you had told me.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Feeling guilty for having Iroha-chan prepare the bento, I protested in a sulky tone. Being the eldest in the 『Home』, Iroha-chan has a lot of things she needs to do. The only thing I can do is cook, after all.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It suddenly occurred to me this morning that if we are going to an unfamiliar district, it would be better to bring some food with us.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Yeah. That’s true&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I agree with Iroha-chan’s words.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Today’s destination is the Former Shinjuku Ward. Since it’s a region we are not really familiar with, conveniently finding a convenience store or supermarket is not easy. Preparing the minimum required food and water is important.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Besides, I’m making Ayaho accompany me in going out for shopping.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Saying that, Iroha-chan grasps my hand. Even though she’s supposed to be the older one, she’s a pampered child, and she sticks to me like this whenever she gets the chance. But well, I don’t mind pampering her like this.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;So, what are we looking for today?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Errr……clothes, perhaps?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan answered my question. For some reason, her tone sounded evasive.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;If it’s about clothes, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to bring Rinka along instead of me?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I ask again, while thinking it’s odd. Rinka is one of our younger sisters. Although she is only 11 years old, she’s fussy about beauty and fashion, and is the fashion leader of our 『Home』. If it’s about whom to accompany for a western clothes shopping trip, I think she is more suitable than me, who’s indifferent regarding clothes.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But Iroha-chan wanders her gaze awkwardly and says,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;well, you know, it’s a bit too early for Rinka──&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;A bit too early for Rinka you say……by any chance what you’re looking for is underwear? Iroha-chan, again……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I turn my gaze to Iroha-chan’s chest without thinking.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan gives a slender impression overall, but her breasts are large. Really large. They were big to begin with, but even now they are steadily growing. Looking at her from the side, she looks really beautiful and honestly it makes me envious, but the person in question says that she finds them unpleasant because they make her look fat. Moreover, finding underwear that fits is really troubling.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;W-Wrong! They’ve become a little tight, but it’s still fine……！&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan shakes her head while using both her hands to hide her breasts.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Come to think of it, I accompanied her in underwear searching 3 months ago too. Certainly, that role is a bit too early for the 11 years old Rinka.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I hope we find some cute underwear.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Yeah……wait, like I said that’s not it!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan denied with a red face. I brush off her words with a ‘yes yes’.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The road which had been abandoned for around four years had collapsed here and there, and the overgrown weeds were making it difficult to walk. Even so, it wasn’t a bad feeling to walk alongside Iroha-chan on the nice, sunny riverside promenade. Come to think of it, it’s been a while since I went out with her like this.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">We continued to walk in silence holding hands for a while.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">And when we were close to the end of the outer moat, Iroha-chan suddenly said as if she remembered something.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;The road, it’s this way, right?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Eh? You were walking without knowing that?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I stare at her dumbfoundedly. Iroha-chan gives a vague, troubled smile and says,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Noー……My intuition told me it would be this way somehow.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;You know, that’s something a person with no sense of direction should never do.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I was confident in it more or less. I thought that walking in the west direction would work out well.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I unfolded the paper map while brushing off Iroha-chan’s excuses. I somehow managed to determine our current location, relying on the broken road signs and building billboards.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Yeah, it’s fine. If we turn at the intersection ahead, it’ll take us to the correct road. It’s a bit of a detour though.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Sorry for that, Ayaho. But well, look. How beautiful.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan pointed to the front, letting out a sigh of relief. The roadside trees planted along the promenade had their light-colored petals magnificently blooming in full glory.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Its cherry blossoms.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Heyー……It’s already that season.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan reaches out her hand, facing the petals fluttering around in the wind.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I was enchanted by her figure for an instance. Iroha-chan turned around from there and looked at me, smiling impishly, as if she had just thought of a good idea.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Shall we eat our lunch?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Eh? Already?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I ask back, looking dumbfounded. Not even an hour has passed since we left 『Home』. We’re only just halfway around the distance to our destination Shinjuku.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But Iroha-chan strongly pulls my sleeves like a child throwing a tantrum, and says,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Please. Isn’t it fine? We can think of it as a cherry blossom viewing party.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Well……it’s ok.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I give a wry smile, thinking it can’t be helped. It wasn’t as if I was caught up in Iroha-chan’s momentum, but I myself wanted to have lunch under the cherry blossoms.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After hearing my words, Iroha-chan made a small guts pose saying ‘Yay’.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Then she turned around her back and called out in a loud voice.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Nuemaru, come here. It’s lunchtime.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A huge beast shows itself, responding to her words.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Its body length would probably be around 6-7 metres, including the tail. It was a monster with pure white fur that not even a wolf, fox or tiger can have──it was a Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While scattering bluish-white lightning, the beast called Nuemaru roars.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The other Spirit Beasts lurking in the shadows of the ruins of our surroundings aiming at us, flinched at Nuemaru’s intimidation, and their presence seemed to fade away.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Facing Nuemaru who was slowly coming closer, Iroha-chan smiled with a ‘thank you’. Nuemaru bent in front of her and purred, feeling good having it’s brows caressed.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Spirit Beasts. The man-eating monsters that suddenly appeared in this country. The reason why we are able to move freely in the 23 wards where they are crowded is because we have Nuemaru guarding us.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">And the one to establish an emotional bond with Nuemaru and the others, and treat them as family, is Iroha-chan.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">As far as we know, Iroha-chan was the only 『Spirit Beast Tamer』 in the entire world.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">That day──That summer day 4 years ago.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A giant dragon appeared in the sky, and deep crimson rain poured down the streets.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">At the same time, Spirit Beasts appeared all over Japan. With powers similar to that of mythical creatures, they attacked everyone without mercy, ate them and destroyed the cities.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">What immediately followed were the orders by the dignitaries, head of states and religious leaders from all around the world.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Kill the Japanese, they said. Annihilate them.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A chain of massacres spread throughout the world in the blink of an eye. Each country promptly began invading Japan with their armies.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The nation known as Japan disappeared in the middle of that madness. The few Japanese who were still abroad too lost their lives one by one, being exposed to the merciless violence. We call that the 『Great Massacre』 ──《J-nocide》.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">And then the Japanese ceased to exist.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That happened a meager six months after the Great Massacre began.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>†</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Woah, amazing. The basement of this department store is really incredible! So many canned foods I haven’t seen before!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Holding up a set of high grade canned food that’s usually used for gifting in her arms, Iroha-chan exclaimed in a lively voice.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In the ruins of a former large department store in Shinjuku. What we found, after entering through an underground passage, was a mountain of untouched goods inside the shop.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">There are a lot of buildings whose basements are flooded with rain water due to being abandoned for 4 years. However, this department store had a subway tunnel running directly underneath it, and it avoided being submerged due to all the water flowing into that tunnel.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Of course, most of the foodstuffs rotted and lost their original form.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, a large part of the canned and preserved food was still safe. All the rare foodstuffs that’s hard to find in convenience stores and supermarkets raised not only Iroha-chan’s excitement, but mine too.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It’s impossible to bring all of this back home.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I said that to Iroha-chan, who was diligently gathering an unusual amount of canned food.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan clutched her head at those words as if receiving a shock and said,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Aaaah……it would’ve been better to bring Tabby and the others along. Since Nuemaru won’t carry the luggage. Now I&#8217;m having trouble deciding which of these to bring home.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan bends on that spot and starts sorting the cans with a serious face.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Of course, she wouldn’t have that much if it was only about what she has to eat. But what she’s probably thinking about are the younger brothers and sisters left behind in the 『Home』.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">There are a total of 8 people in the 『Home』. The oldest Iroha-chan is 16, and the youngest Runa is only 7 years old. We are not related by blood, but still a precious family that lives together helping each other out. We are the survivors from the few Japanese left in this ruined city.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It’s due to Iroha-chan that we luckily managed to survive that hellish Great Massacre. When we were attacked by a flock of Spirit Beasts and ready to die without knowing anything, Iroha-chan appeared, bringing Nuemaru with her, and saved us.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Not only that, the Spirit Beasts tamed by her started protecting us from the other Spirit Beasts since then. Tabby is one of those ally Spirit Beasts.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">There were around 70 people saved by Iroha-chan in that manner. Among them were qualified teachers, nurses and electricians. They were the ones that prepared the building for the 『Home』, installed solar panels and drinking water pumps. They were the ones that established the foundation of our living.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However, within a year after that, all the adults were gone.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Some feared Iroha-chan and left as if escaping. Some died due to accidents or diseases. However, a large number of them took their own lives. They were all despairing. Despairing at the reality they were the only remaining survivors in this ruined city and all the other Japanese had died out──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In the end, we 8 were the only ones remaining.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That’s why Iroha-chan cherishes us. Like an actual family, or even more.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That&#8217;s the reason why in this gloomy, ruined basement, she is so earnestly rummaging through canned goods to bring back home as souvenirs.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Is it fine to only take the canned goods back home? I mean, didn’t we come here to look for underwear?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I say that to Iroha-chan’s back with an amazed look as she is still worrying.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan raises her face with a taken aback expression, and says,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Not underwear, but clothes! Clothes!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I have the floor guide. It says the underwear are……on the 3rd floor I think. They also have large sizes.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I think there’s probably a slightly different meaning to the ‘large size’.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan put down the cans and stood up while pouting her lips for some reason.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It’s spacious……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After arriving at the Woman’s Clothing Section, we were lightly overwhelmed by its size.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">We didn’t have many expectations since it was abandoned for 4 years, but the products inside the floor were almost still in their perfect state without being damaged.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Western clothes of luxury brands, bags, shoes, accessories──All of them brilliant and dazzling, conveying the affluence of this country in the times of peace. It was an exciting yet painful scene.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I wish I could have taken a look at this in a brighter place.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I sigh softly, staring at the mannequin, stylishly wearing a summer one-piece.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The department store with no lighting was dark, making the rare bright-colored clothes look gloomy.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It may look like this, but I brought the most powerful flashlight.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan held the outdoor-use LED lantern on the maximum output overhead.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">With that, we could now see far into the floor, but it was still way off from the original brightness a department store has.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I see……it was the swimsuit season……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Wandering into the specially set-up swimsuit section, both Iroha-chan and I exchanged glances.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The Great Massacre took place in summer. At that time, this specially prepared place would have been definitely crowded with people looking for new swimsuits.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Would you like to try them on?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">With her eyes lighting up, Iroha-chan stares at me. I shake my head, flustered, and say,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;No no. These flashy ones won’t suit me at all. It would be another thing if Iroha-chan is the one wearing them.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Is that soー……I think this one is cute, though.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Not a chance. Definitely not. In the first place, I don’t even know how to swim.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It’s not like I’m making excuses, but I was just 9 years old when I experienced the Great Massacre. And since then, a chance to swim in a pool never came. Naturally, there were no swimming lessons too, so there was no way I could learn how to swim.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In spite of that, Iroha-chan who was reluctant to part with the bikini she picked up, said,</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I really want to go swimmingー……Let’s all go together when it’s summer. We’ll bring fireworks. And watermelons too.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Would the watermelons make it in time for summer if we plant them now?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Who knows. I’ll check that out next time. We’ll have to look for watermelon seeds somewhere too.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan says that with her usual positive attitude. It seems like in her mind, going to the sea has become a matter of fact.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Well, it’s not like I&#8217;m entirely against the idea.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Especially, I want our younger siblings to get hands-on experience of swimming, and if things go well, there’s a chance we can get our hands on fresh ingredients like clams. However, as expected, I’m a bit reluctant about wearing a swimsuit.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Anyhow, we are the only surviving Japanese left, so it’s not like someone other than our family will see us.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Nonetheless, imagining myself standing side-by-side with a swimsuit wearing Iroha-chan, that alone makes me embarrassed enough to run. Because Iroha-chan is not only beautiful but has a great figure too. On top of that, all our younger sisters are adorable, and there’s no doubt they’ll become beautiful in the future. I think the world is a bit unfair.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;The future……huh……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I absentmindedly mutter while looking around the swimsuit section.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Ever since the Great Massacre, all the 23 wards of Tokyo were designated as No-trespassing Isolation zones, and were even abandoned by the countries dividing and conquering Japan. Not even criminals bother entering this place, which is a gathering of Spirit Beasts.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That’s why we, who were protected by Spirit Beasts, conversely became safe.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Harvesting vegetables from the house garden, collecting eggs from domesticated chickens, and recovering canned goods and preserved foods from the abandoned buildings, we lived without any major inconveniences.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But I don’t think that kind of everyday life would continue on forever. Even preserved food will last only a few more years, before their expiry dates arrive. Someday, we too would have to leave these 23 wards.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Walking absentmindedly while thinking that, I failed to notice something unusual.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan’s presence had vanished before I realized it.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Iroha-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I stop and call out to her.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The lantern she was supposed to be holding was still on the top of a shelf.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Only her figure had vanished.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I wonder if she went to try on a swimsuit?</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But I don’t think she’ll take the trouble to go to the changing room in this situation, where there were only the two of us.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Iroha-chan, where are you!?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">My voice trembles without thinking.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Alone in an unfamiliar place. I was terrified by this fact.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Nuemaru wasn’t by our side either. Since his size prohibited him from entering the building, we made him wait for us at the entrance of the department store. If I get attacked by a Spirit Beast at this moment, I would have no means to protect myself.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The reason why we are able to move freely in the 23 wards, where not even armies set foot into, is because Iroha-chan was here with us. If she, the Spirit Beast tamer were to disappear, then we──</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;──?!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">My toes touched something.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The clothes put on display shook, and something rolled out from the gap between them.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">What I saw first was long hair.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Thin, bony arms. Teeth laid bare. Hollow eye sockets.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I gasped, and gulped instead of screaming, making a sound with my throat.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Immediately after that.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Ayaho!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Someone held me up from behind before I collapsed. Someone with a warm body temperature and sweet smell.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Iroha……chan……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan, who was supposed to have disappeared, was hugging me while slightly out of breath.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Looking at her face, all the fear I had until now disappeared.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I’m sorry for leaving you alone. I saw this child approaching, so──&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan showed an expression mixed with guilt and relief.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;This child……?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After turning around, this time I let out a short scream.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">What was standing behind Iroha-chan was a beast with a body so large you would have to look up.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">A bipedal monster with a figure like that of a raccoon. A Spirit Beast.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The monster, which is supposed to be humanity’s natural enemy, is attached to Iroha-chan like an obedient pet, and is sticking close to her back. Before I could notice, Iroha-chan found a Spirit Beast lurking in the building, rushed up to it and easily tamed it.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">No one knows why Iroha-chan is able to do such things, and she herself has no idea about it. In any case, nothing will change the fact that I was saved by that ability. That’s all that matters for now.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;She looks like a victim of the Great Massacre. A long time has passed since her death.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan said after bending down at my feet.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Lying there on the ground was a human being turned into a skeleton.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was the remains of a woman wearing the department store uniform. She seemed to have lost her life in the middle of the Great Massacre uproar for some reason, and had been left alone in this place since then.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">She wasn’t killed by the Spirit Beasts. I think she might have been pushed away by the panicking crowd, but there’s no way to make sure now.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It wasn’t the first time I saw a dead body, but that didn’t mean I was used to it.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">As I’m holding back my tears, Iroha-chan embraces my shoulders, and says in a gentle voice.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Let’s bury the remains later. Look, Donburi will also help.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;……Donburi?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I made a dubious expression at that out-of-place word.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It’s this child’s name. I just gave it. You see, since the pattern on its tail resembles a ramen bowl.&#8221;<sup><a id="a2" href="#n2">[2]</a></sup></p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan puffs up her chest with pride for some reason, pointing at the Spirit Beast behind her.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">There’s certainly a spiral pattern on the tail of this Spirit Beast that has the appearance of a raccoon. You can say it somewhat resembles a ramen bowl.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Even if it’s the case, what kind of name is that for a Spirit Beast?</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It’s unfortunate that you have such a naming sense, Iroha-chan&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While sighing, I said in a tone that was less nervous than before.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Eh? Really!? It wasn’t cute!?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">While looking at me with a surprised face, Iroha-chan dropped her shoulders as if she was a little hurt.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" style="padding-top:2em;padding-bottom:2em;font-size:18px;">†</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">After burying the remains of the employee in a garden on the department store’s roof, we returned inside.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It was nearly an hour after that when Iroha-chan found the section for the products she was after.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Countless shirts, blouses, blazers or skirts are lined up in this clean, spacious section.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Isn’t this……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;That’s right. This is the uniform section.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan gently laughs at my surprise.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Ayaho, you would’ve started middle school from this year, right? That’s why I wanted you to wear a uniform. The schools are already gone now, but at least you can wear the uniform.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Ah……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I stood dumbfounded while staring at the uniform torsos lined alongside the wall.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In this world where the Japanese died out, there’s no middle school for me to attend.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The day I would become an actual middle schooler will never come.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Still, the uniforms in front of my eyes made my heart tremble.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The symbol of the former peaceful everyday life and the hope for the future.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In front of me, there existed the fragment of yearning I had started to forget.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Even in this cruel world, I continue to live and grow.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">The middle school uniforms here served as the testament to that.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">It’s the finest present Iroha-chan prepared for me.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Come on now, It’s fine to choose the uniform of any middle school you like.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan, while holding the lantern, brought uniforms one by one in front of me. The old-fashioned sailor uniforms and the somewhat unfashionable blazers, each one of them looked so attractive and hard to choose from.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;I wonder if it&#8217;s fine for me to wear them without permission……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Of course it’s fine. Middle school is a part of compulsory education, so there are no entrance exams.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;If it’s a private school then probably there will be an entrance exam……ah, but this uniform is cute.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It becomes hard to choose when there are so many choices, right? I wonder if I should also try on a high school uniform.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan says while staring greedily at the high school uniform corner.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I couldn’t help but smile at those words, which were so typical of her.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Iroha-chan loves cosplaying after all.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Cosplay!? Wait, I’m still at the age where I would have attended a high school……!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan protests weakly as if she is upset.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In the meantime, I picked up the first uniform. A completely ordinary, navy blue sailor uniform. It was a plain design you would expect from a middle school, but I think that conversely made it wonderful.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;D-does this look good?&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;It does! So cute! As expected from my little sister!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">Iroha-chan hugs me, who had put on the sailor uniform.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I felt like obediently receiving all her exaggerated compliments this time. Since Iroha-chan is my precious family, my one and only older sister.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Thank you, Onee-chan&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I convey my words of gratitude to Iroha-chan while holding back the embarrassment.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">However in the next instance, I became startled when tears started falling from her eyes.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Ayaho……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Oh hey, don’t cry, Iroha-chan! You are getting too emotional over something like this.&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Because……because……!&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">&#8220;Jeez, it can’t be helped then……&#8221;</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">I pat Iroha-chan’s back with a wry smile. To cry after seeing a family member in a uniform for the first time, rather than an older sister, that’s more like a mother.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">We cannot stay like this forever.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In time, surely the day we’ll have to leave this ruined city will come.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">But still, the time we spent as a family is not a lie.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">That’s why till then, we’ll continue to live here.</p>



<p style="font-size:18px;">In this hollow world.</p>
