<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>Feeling a burning pain and impact, Yahiro fell to the sand-smeared ground.</p>



<p>Fresh blood poured out of his lungs spreading a vivid taste of death in his mouth.</p>



<p>He could hear the sound of the wind. It was the sound of scorching air blowing through the gaps between the steel frames of the decaying buildings.</p>



<p>It was summer.</p>



<p>The fourth summer since that tragedy.</p>



<p>No traces of the people that lived here remained in this ruined city.</p>



<p>Only the cry of cicadas could be heard. Their incessant cry announced the arrival of night.</p>



<p>Their fierce obsession with life and the vitality of their species was something to behold. Even the terrain-altering dreadful attack, or the death of all the residents of the city, was probably not a big deal for those noisy insects.</p>



<p>It was truly moving, and unsightly.</p>



<p>With those thoughts in his mind, Yahiro stared at the evening sky through the cracked ceiling.</p>



<p>A scarlet afterglow that seemed to scorch the heavens.</p>



<p>That red sky was probably the reason why his old memory resurfaced.</p>



<p>Crimson rain poured like a mist that summer four years ago, dyeing the world in the color of flames.</p>



<p>All he could see was a cluster of collapsed skyscrapers and the wreckage.</p>



<p>The ashen lump of iron that was once called a train, was now twisted and crushed to the point it stopped retaining its original form.</p>



<p>Bridges had fallen, roads had collapsed, and even the terrain had changed, making the city feel like an unfamiliar foreign country.</p>



<p>The downpour continued. It was red, just like rusting iron.</p>



<p>There was else nothing that moved.</p>



<p>There were no living beings left anywhere.</p>



<p>The few million people living in this city were eaten and had vanished, not even leaving behind a corpse.</p>



<p>The only thing left was the 13 years old Narusawa Yahiro, who could only clutch his bloodstained hands.</p>



<p>“Su……i……!”</p>



<p>The boy&#8217;s scream echoed pointlessly in the ruined city filled with silence.</p>



<p>He still remembered the warmth of his little sister’s tiny hands.</p>



<p>And also her young and innocent smile.</p>



<p>However, that figure of her had also disappeared, leaving behind only the fresh blood dyeing his entire body.</p>



<p>“Where are you……Sui……?!”</p>



<p>There was no response to his screams. Only the silent, fiercely blowing winds had gained momentum.</p>



<p>After climbing up the stairs buried under rubble, the boy emerged on high ground.</p>



<p>All he could see was a broken city that resembled a poorly made diorama. Those uninhabited ruins were wet with the deep crimson rain</p>



<p>The flames bursting up all over the urban areas had lit up the early morning sky like a sunset glow.</p>



<p>A 『calamity』 was flying in that sky.</p>



<p>A shadow so gigantic that it could cover his entire field of vision.</p>



<p>That rainbow-colored 『monster』 swam in the sea of clouds as if drawing a circle, lording over the surface.</p>



<p>“I’m glad…… You were still alive, Nii-sama.”</p>



<p>He heard a clear voice that had a hint of laughter.</p>



<p>Accompanied by the flying 『monster』 behind her, a girl silently looked down at the shivering Yahiro.</p>



<p>While bathing in the deep crimson rain, Narusawa Sui softly smiled.</p>



<p>“Or else, were you unable to die?”</p>



<p>They never go away. He still can’t forget them.</p>



<p>Those clear eyes of hers that reflected the dying world.</p>



<p>And also the figure of the beautiful yet sinister dragon flying around behind her──</p>



<p>“……Tch!”</p>



<p>His consciousness was clouded only for an instance.</p>



<p>Waking up with intense indignation, Yahiro leaped to the side as if rolling.</p>



<p>The fangs that were right above his head grazed him. They were the fangs of a Spirit Beast with a height nearing 3 meters.</p>



<p>The Spirit Beast crashed into the concrete wall due to its excess momentum.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of that gap, Yahiro picked up the fallen knife and fixed his posture.</p>



<p>His wounds were in such serious condition that it was laughable.</p>



<p>One of his lungs was crushed, and his right scapula<sup><a id="a1" href="#n1">[1]</a></sup> was completely smashed up to the point where his right shoulder was barely attached to his body</p>



<p>A frail human’s body was in this state just by being lightly struck by a Spirit Beast’s forelimb. An intense pain that could burn the nerves still continued to assault Yahiro.</p>



<p>The Spirit Beast turned towards Yahiro while gnawing at the fragments of concrete.</p>



<p>A stench like that of burning sulfur irritated Yahiro&#8217;s nose.</p>



<p>The monster in front of him was a dog-shaped Spirit Beast with a jet-black body. If it were the guys from the army who encountered it, they would’ve been overjoyed and given it over-the-top names like Black Dog or Hellhound.</p>



<p>However, Yahiro held no interest in the names of Spirit Beasts.</p>



<p>A Spirit Beast was a Spirit Beast. If it attacked, he just had to exterminate it.</p>



<p>The black Spirit Beast lowered its posture while expelling out a sulfur-stinking breath.</p>



<p>It had a huge body rivaling that of a bison and had a hound’s agility and intelligence. A Spirit Beast, whose astounding fighting ability was far removed from the natural providence, was not an opponent a flesh and blood human should oppose.</p>



<p>It seemed like the lookouts who were accompanying Yahiro, were already either killed or had ran away.</p>



<p>They were the guys who looked down on Yahiro with contempt without hiding it because he was Japanese. Even if they had survived, he couldn’t count on their support.</p>



<p>Right now, Yahiro was injured so badly that it was a wonder he could still move, and the only weapon he had was a knife.</p>



<p><em><strong>It won’t be a problem</strong></em>, he said as the corners of his lips rose.</p>



<p>Yahiro pressed the knife into his own wounds, letting the fresh blood cling to the blade.</p>



<p>The black Spirit Beast attacked Yahiro while howling.</p>



<p>At the same time, Yahiro too dashed towards it.</p>



<p>The two silhouettes intersected in the twilight.</p>



<p>The Spirit Beast tried to thrust his giant fangs into Yahiro’s left arm.</p>



<p>However, its attack came to a halt.</p>



<p>Yahiro’s arms were stopping the Spirit Beast’s jaw that could easily bite through concrete. The fresh blood sticking to his skin had hardened like armor and had defended him from the Spirit Beast’s fangs.</p>



<p>By that time, he had already switched the knife to his right hand.</p>



<p>“Come on, it’s time for revenge……!”</p>



<p>Yahiro whispered as if it was intended for the knife and stabbed it into the Spirit Beast’s flank.</p>



<p>With a blade length just short of 15 centimeters, the knife was quite thin and unreliable when compared to the huge body of the Spirit Beast. It could barely pierce through its tough skin even when stabbed all the way to the base.</p>



<p>However, the result it had on the Spirit Beast’s body was dramatic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cracks formed all over its jet-black body with the wound gouged out by the knife as the center.</p>



<p>The cracks expanded via the Spirit Beast&#8217;s blood vessels. Instead of the poison mixed in the blood, it was as if destruction itself was spreading──</p>



<p>The Spirit Beast raised an anguished howl. A gleam of anger and hatred dwelled in its pair of eyes that glared at Yahiro.</p>



<p>However, its resistance only lasted that far.</p>



<p>The limbs which were covered in cracks could no longer support its huge jet-black body and broke like a brittle plaster figure.</p>



<p>Eventually, the Spirit Beast’s whole body broke apart and crumbled down on the spot, eventually turning into ashes.</p>



<p>Yahiro stared at that with indifference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He put the knife which had served its purpose back into the sheath, and casually touched his right shoulder, which was covered in blood.</p>



<p>His crushed lung, smashed-up shoulder, and torn-off right arm had already finished regenerating.</p>



<p>There were no scars left. The only signs of his injuries were the bloodstains on his ripped clothes.</p>



<p>A part of the arm that was almost torn off was still there, but it too regenerated quickly.</p>



<p>But that didn&#8217;t mean it wouldn’t have regenerated if the arm was completely gone.</p>



<p>Yahiro wouldn&#8217;t have died. That&#8217;s because he cannot die.</p>



<p>Even if he were to get an injury that could cause instant death, or lost more than half of his body, his cursed flesh wouldn&#8217;t allow him to die and would reconstruct all his internal organs and revive him.</p>



<p>That’s why on that rainy day 4 years ago, he was the only survivor in that ruined city.</p>



<p>Yahiro left the building after retrieving the intended item.</p>



<p>In the middle of twilight, what spread beyond the horizon was the abandoned, uninhabited ruined city.</p>



<p>A giant tower, which was smashed through the middle, was exposing its fossil-like pitiful figure.</p>



<p>It was the steel tower that was once known as the Tokyo Skytree.</p>



<p>The season was summer.</p>



<p>It was the fourth summer since the ethnic group of people known as Japanese had died out.</p>



<p>Even now, Yahiro continues to wander around this city.</p>
