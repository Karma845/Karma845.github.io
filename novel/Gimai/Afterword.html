<h4>Afterword</h4>

<p>Thank you very much for buying volume 6 of the novelized [Gimai Seikatsu] series. I’m the original creator of both the YouTube version and this novel series, Mikawa Ghost. And this time, I believe I have to bring up the news that most of you have most likely heard about already. That’s right, I’m talking about the anime adaptation. The other day, a glorious anime adaptation for [Gimai Seikatsu] has been announced, with the cast of the YouTube series being enlisted for the actual anime. There couldn’t be any better news, don’t you think? I was truly delighted to hear of this decision. And it’s all thanks to the fans who have supported this series all the way until now. Thank you so much. It will take quite some time until the broadcast, but I hope you look forward to it.</p>



<p>Finally, my thanks. My illustrator Hiten-san, voice actors and actresses Nakashima Yuki-san, Amasaki Kouhei-san, Suzuki Ayu-san, Hamano Daiki-san, Suzuki Minori-san, video director Ochiai Yuusuke-san, and everyone else from the YouTube version, as well as my editor O-san, mangaka Kanade Yumika-san, and everybody else from the publishing and editorial department, and finally all my dear readers: Thank you very much.</p>
