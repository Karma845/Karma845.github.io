<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Cutting In</h3>

<p><span class="calibre13">We
stayed in a dungeon city along the border of the Elf Queen Kingdom and the Dwarf
Kingdom.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
next day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
registering as adventurers, we lined up early in the morning to enter the
dungeon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
about some grilled skewers for breakfast?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Preserved
food!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Preserved
food is on sale now!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Recovery
potions, wounds medicine, arrows, we've everything you need!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
entrance to the dungeon was at the far end of the city.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
first glance, it looked more like a cave than a dungeon entrance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Dwarf Kingdom is surrounded by mountains.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
dungeon was discovered at the foot of the mountain.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">High
walls like castle walls surrounded the dungeon entrance. A steel door is wide
open, with dwarf guards checking the tags of adventurers who will enter.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Stalls
and vendors surrounded the area, trying to sell their goods to the adventurers
who will enter the dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
standing in front of me seems very interested. He looks around with curious
eyes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hmm
... humans, beastmen, the dwarf race is the majority, while the elf, demon, and
dragonmen are rarely seen."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Since
ancient times, the two races always have conflict in handling this dungeon,
which is why the elves are rarely seen here. The reason why not many demons and
dragonmen is simply because of the geographical factor. There are many humans because
there is a dungeon here."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
expected from Dark-sama (fake name). That's a great insight."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold,
me and Nemumu are lining up in that order.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is a purpose for this lineup.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
is in the front as a shield to protect me, and Nemumu, who excelled in
detection, in the rear.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Although
it's hard to imagine any surface world adventurer who can defeat me, it is a
precautionary act.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was Nemumu who insisted on this idea.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We
don't want anything to happen to Raito-sama," she assured me with a
serious expression.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Therefore,
Nemumu's hugging me from behind with her hands on my shoulders is purely to
protect me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
embarrassing to feel her soft boobs against the back of my head, but if Nemumu
insists, I have no choice but to obey.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
all, I'm 12 or 13 years old, and Nemumu is 17 or 18 years old.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">From
a third party's point of view, we would look like siblings.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
it is still inevitable that we stand out.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
adventurers, vendors, stall keepers, and other people around us gave us curious
stares, and a few rude ones said, "Who are these humans?</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
is tall, wearing armor from head to toe. When he stands in the line, everyone
can see his head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
is a beautiful brown-skinned girl with silver hair that reflects the morning
sun. The men look at her with affection and ulterior motives, while the women look
at her with jealousy and other ulterior reasons.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I'm
wearing a black hood and a mask. People are staring at me because I'm
sandwiched between them and being treated carefully.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">By
the way, the Dwarf Kingdom is located just west of the continent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
city we are in is located at the southernmost tip of the Dwarf Kingdom, and the
Demon Kingdom is located at the north. One needs to cross the mountains or
cross other race territories to reach there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Dragonmen Empire is located just east of the continent, so it is difficult to
reach those two countries.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(........Are?)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Ahead
of us, a novice adventurer team with members around 15 years old. Suddenly a
young human wearing a hood and carrying hand luggage cutting the line in front
of the team.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His height
is around 170cm. Despite walking with luggage in his hands, his balance is
steady. I could tell that he had been working out a lot.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was a little shameful that people with that skill cutting in the line.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
novice adventurers who were interrupted by that man are too scared to warn him,
so they looked at each other and said, "What, what should we do?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
read the air and offer a helping hand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey,
hoody! Don't cut in."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
warned on their behalf, and the hood man turned around.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young people in between us shrunk.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
dare you warn me......? Do you know who I am?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
do I know who you are when you're hiding your face behind a hood? .......Even
if I don't know you and you're a high-profile person, more reason for you to
refrain from embarrassing yourself by cutting in."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Wha-ha-ha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">The
Lord is right! I should be more scared if we know the identity under that hood.
Are you drunk from slurping down alcohol in the daytime? Don't talk nonsense
and quietly line up at the back of the line. You not just troubling us, but the
others in line as well."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama
is right. Now quickly go to the back of the line. Or are you too dumb to
understand that?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
response to my warning, Gold and Nemumu also raised their voices.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
boy is right! You should be scared if we knew your true identity!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
that's right! Line up properly as the boy said!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not just Gold and Nemumu.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The human
adventurers who lined up behind me who agree with my opinion also booed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Maybe
because they don't know the race of the hood man. Some of the adventurers are very
brave, and perhaps they saw us as human adventurers and voiced their minds.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">And
the dwarves and beastmen adventurers in line are watching the scene with a
silent and cold gaze.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
don't like the hoods' intrusion. Still, they're probably more annoyed that the humans
they consider inferior make so much noise.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You,
you humans are just bugs that we used to trample......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Hood man had a lot of pride in his words and actions, and his whole body shook
with rage when he was booed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
could tell at a glance that he is furious.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
I didn't care and told him further.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
warning you because you're breaking a rule that even a bug would understand. If
you understand, please go to the back of the line.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How,
how dare you...?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
hooded man stretches out his arms to take his luggage, holding his patience by
clenching his teeth.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Humans....
you bugs race got carried away. Remember that!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
spitting out a few words, he left the line and started walking to the back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">the
adventurers behind us praised me for showing the human race spirit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
I had finished responding to them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank,
thank you so much for your help!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young adventurer in front of us thanks me for my help.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Apparently,
it was a party of four.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">One
of them is a boy with short red hair who seems to be the leader of the group,
and hiding behind him is a girl with the same hair color and facial features.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other members are a slightly short boy and a taller boy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
girl is 12 or 13 years old, and maybe the boy is around 14 or 15 years old.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
didn't know what to say because it was so sudden. If we quarrel with other
prideful races, we could get into trouble....... I'm sorry we ended up having
you solved the problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
don't worry about it. I'm just doing what is right. Besides, we will be in trouble because our turn will be delayed."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
leader, the red-haired boy bowed his head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
ignored his gracious attitude and answered with a calm voice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young people are completely relieved of the tension and laughed at each other,
probably because my response was good.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you very much. That mask is really cool too. Is that armor really made from
gold too?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey,
Gimra!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Don't
be rude!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Leader
and everyone else is curious too, right?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hahahahahaha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">It's
only natural that you're curious about my golden armor!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">By
the way, this armor is not made from gold..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
it's not. It's just a fake that looks like one. If you think about it, there is
no such thing as gold covering the whole body. Above all, there is no point in
making armor out of gold, which has a low hardness."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
who had been listening to the conversation, turned to Gold and bluntly cut off
the conversation.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
adventurers around her seemed to agree with her. "If one thinks about it
with common sense, that's true."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Actually,
the armor is a mixture of gold and rare metals to enhance its defensive
capabilities and keep its golden glow.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
there is no need for him to tell them about it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
red-haired boy who was called the leader bowed his head again.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
sorry. Our party member was rude to you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
worry about it. It's Gold's hobby, or rather his...... obsession, and people
often misunderstood him. We've gotten used to it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
let out a dry voice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
fact, even if he painted it over, it would be useless because the magical
effect would repaint it golden. By default, it's his appearance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
is in line with our purpose of making a name as adventurers, so there is no
problem leaving it as it is now.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Every,
everyone has their own preferences."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young leader of the group took my words in stride and brushed them off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Surely
the adventurers around us think that he's a knight with a strange obsession.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
red hair leader is trying to change the weird atmosphere.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
don't mean to be rude, but this is your first time in this dungeon, right?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What?
Is it so obvious to see?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
asked, tilting my head at his point.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
nodded his head.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"There
are many types of dungeons. The dungeons here are different from the others in
that each floor is spacious. That's why it's common to stay in the dungeon. I
can tell that because you all don't have any outdoor equipment with you. So the
next time you enter the dungeon, I suggest you bring along some outdoor
equipment."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
we are having a conversation, it's time for the red-haired leader's party to
enter into the dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
bowed to us and hurriedly moved forward.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Soon
it's our turn.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
I'm thinking, they called us to proceed to enter the dungeon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">("Item
boxes" are rare, and "the three of us have it". It might look
suspicious. Should I mention that one of us has an item box, or should we
prepare a package with outdoor equipment for disguise?)</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
thinking about which option to choose or is there any better idea. We step into
the dungeon. </span></p>
